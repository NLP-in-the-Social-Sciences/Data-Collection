1,EdwardWarren,"My Mom was  a high school cafeteria worker and my Dad got his GED when he was 45 and was pretty much a bum for most of my life.  They did their best.

I graduate 13th in my high school class.  I thought I was smart.  I attended a college, which at the time, was literally full of valedictorians and salutatorians.  Once I got on campus I felt like I could I could barely read or write and there were all  these really smart people who had read Chaucer and Tolstoy, whoever they are.  All of them, it seemed, had had calculus and I barely understood 5th grade math.  Most of them were somewhat nice to me but a quite a few of them looked down their big city academic noses at poor little old country me.   After two years of pretty poor grades I quit and joined the USMC to keep from being drafted.  Those smarty pants folks didn't need me holding up the curve for them.  I wish I had known that I was some kind of victim and suffered from the imposter syndrome. Now I have an legitimate excuse for my poor performance.  Can I claim a disability?",1.34
4,actuallynotcanadian,"&gt;I'm a first generation college student and I was baffled at how many non-first gen students showed up to the first gen meeting at my law schoool. They either claimed to be allies or ""the first in their family to go to law school."" They fully utilized the networking and the resources since the school had no problem with it. They already knew how to talk to upper class individuals. How could we compete but to mimic them? Made a whole bunch of us actual first-gen students confused and further like an imposter.

I have a friend who considers himself to have a 'working class' background. His father is a university-trained teacher and his mother attended uni for a few years before changing to become a medical assistant. A bit of a far stretch...",0.8933333333333333
13,raybiesninja,"That's how gatekeeping works. Welcome to tech &amp; engineering... where some of the worst gatekeepers lurk. Even in open source projects the impetus of participating is generally based upon these practices, especially you want to design.  In schools where there's a lot of self driven interest it's bad. I volunteered for my daughter's robotics club at arguably the best STEM school in my state and I found boys were especially unwilling to help girls, they would trash the parts lab and expect the girls to maintain the logbooks, do PR, and clean up the parts they scattered everywhere.  I got so frustrated I left and none of my daughters have expressed any further desire to do STEM. As an engineering dad, It broke my heart, but I don't blame them.",0.8666666666666667
22,HauntedFrigateBird,"Same.  I'm pushing 40 and I still see the effect.  I don't know if it's imagined or not.  I know that the idea that I have a mountain of student-loan debt and will have to spend money to keep my mom out of a shelter, as opposed to spending that on better work clothes, seems completely foreign to people here. 

People generally get along best with those they have things in common with; I was a psychologist for many years and the notion 'birds of a feather flock together' is actually quite true.  I feel like an imposter because I don't have a lot in common with the people where I work now (high finance), even if they're nice enough people.  Likewise they probably view me as this foreign being because I don't have anything remotely similar to them in my past.  Most of my coworkers parents were professionals, my mom and I used to pick cans out of trash to trade in for change to get food.  Not a lot of common ground there.",1.1666666666666667
27,realgirl_fakename,"I am a first-generation college student currently pursuing a Doctorate degree and my career is in educational access with this group of students. Imposter syndrome is real and impacts thousands, if not millions, of students in American and across the Globe. Colleges and universities aim to recruit these students because it looks good on performance-based reports but struggle with retention of these students because of the lack fo support systems for this marginalized group. LIFG (Low-income/First-Generation Students) can, and do, succeed but could do so much easier with proper supports. It's important for these students to have a trusted mentor to help with the process and it's unfortunate that most do not find such a mentor until they've already considered leaving the college/university of their choice. LIFG students can thrive in competition, much like their peers but not until Imposter Syndrome is squelched - hard but not impossible.",0.9866666666666667
28,sana01ali,"Another thing that is difficult is when there's class difference involved. Personally coming from a different financial background, it makes you feel out of place and sometimes there's envy because you didn't have the same opportunities (I.e. classes, private tuition, schools..). So not only did you not have guidance, but it feels like you have to work harder (emphasis on the feels like). When everyone is like,""I'm going to go home and ask a parent you had done rigorous studies in this field"", it makes you feel really isolated. Sometimes you can't help but wish your parents were able to help you more or have a sibling that went through it.",0.74
122,ProgressiveOverlorde,"&gt; but to mimic them? Made a whole bunch of us actual first-gen students confused and further like an imposter.

I felt that... deep inside my soul. I had a similar experience. It was a nightmare. I wish I had the clarity to learn when to quit. For me, the costs were much higher to stay in school, than to take another route. It is that ""never quit attitude"" that was instilled in me that got me to be accepted in university. However, the system in university does not favor just solely hard work. It favors, those who can afford it. I learned that the hard way. I was destroyed in terms of my mental and in turn my physical health for 4 years. Meanwhile, my parents didn't realize how severe my issues were. I told them my situation and they had no comprehension. They couldn't help me either as they just told me ""don't be weak"" and ""don't quit"". As well, I lived on campus 200km (124m) away so they didn't see my mental health breaking down.  


In the end, I finished what I called hell 5 years ago, with a degree that does nothing to get me out of the debt I put myself through to experience such torture. I can laugh about it now because at least I can't get any lower than feeling socially isolated.",1.5266666666666666
128,ProgressiveOverlorde,"&gt;ks and how to work the world in their favor; and encourage them to explore, be curious, lead, and venture out on their own.  I was lucky if my parents had the budget for me to play little league baseball.

I felt this too much definitely. I felt so alone at university, especially since I moved away from home to go to school. in addition I was the only person who picked a school none of my high school friends ended up going. I was in debt, felt like i couldn't connect to other students etc. The school was predominately affluent, and white students, which I was not. Just the socioeconomic and cultural differences made it hard for me to connect to others and make friends. I had no close support network. The imposter syndrome lead me to change my lifestyle for the worse to try to fit in and made me question my identity. For the first two years of uni, I hadn't learned the mental tools to deal with being a social outcast, as I was never one in my hometown. I had depression the whole time and felt like i was in a nightmare. The last two years I wasn't as depressed because I understood better how the ""culture"" at my campus worked.

The only thing that kept me positive was the gym, which I can't live without now. The upside of this situation was that I experienced how it sucks to be isolated. I would never wish it upon anybody.",1.6933333333333334
135,theSecretTechnique,"Hey, that was my experience also. Not even a little help from the parents and I just received my Masters. I just wanted to wish you good luck and give you a little advice. 

First, attend all of your classes. There are so many reasons for this but I especially like to have the benefit of the doubt in close calls. 

Secondly, prioritize your health, physical and mental.

Thirdly, set your own pace. Some of your fellow students may have advantages that you do not. Do not let that discourage you. 

Have a great experience and don't afraid to be challenged. That's how we grow!",0.7
141,n00batlife1,"It’s reassuring to see this in print. Or as good as. This was really difficult for me to battle with during college, living at home, and taking care of my family. I working construction on the weekends and went to school 5 days a week, learning nothing. And when I mean nothing I mean nothing. I found out after my teacher was since fired. I got financial aid to take these courses so early (skipping junior and senior year of hs) but being that young and having experienced a lot of life. Through events music and other such things I had a weird battle convincing myself it was just one quarter of feeling like an imposter both due to how fake the class seemed and how happy my classmates were with learning nothing, and how I’d be the first in my family to get a college education and on the other side the first not to. If you see a friend who may be struggling with this who’s close enough to really trust what you’re saying make sure they know that you support them even if you don’t understand the struggle.",1.2733333333333334
142,Maynovaz,"Tbh I am super embarrassed that before I took chemistry in high school, I didn’t really know that it was a subject to be studied. Yeah you learn about atoms and molecules before that but chemical reactions and actually learning the in depth science behind it blew my mind because no one in my family had taken college level chemistry or had slept through their high school chemistry. I was so enraptured by it that I took AP chemistry after and even went for a biochemistry degree in college. It didn’t matter how many As I got or how many science classes I took, I definitely felt like an imposter a lot.",0.7466666666666667
153,lost_survivalist,"Gosh, just from reading this I see a path that I could have followed. My first year of college had no friends either, but classes were interesting tho scary at the same time cause of the thought of"" what if I fail"". I cried cause I lost all my friends and was alone. 

I forced myself to check out clubs, any club that seemed mildly interesting. found one that had meetings in day time and just stuck with it even tho the clubs was no where near beneficial for my degree. people were nice and it became the highlight of my college experience. I only made 2 good friends, but atleast I made a happy place on campus, which then enabled me to get a degree.",0.84
163,bigscrollingguy,"I think that this is just a reflection of a students support system. Neither of my parents ever even considered getting a higher education and it makes me feel like there isn’t a weight on my shoulders  of living up to their huge academic accomplishments. I’m currently studying for the mcat while starting my last undergrad semester, and even though they think I’m insane for the amount of studying and pressure I put on myself, they support the hell out of me nonetheless. In contrast, my ochem professor’s son, who I had always thought to be a genius, recently backed out of his mcat appointment because of the pressure that he felt going into it. Anecdotal, I know, but it goes right against these so called findings. I have always loved dabbling in psychology because of how misunderstood and interesting it seems to be in our day and age! But damn... I feel like this sub keeps posting studies where researchers find another correlation and then come up with a superficial narrative perfectly explaining a “phenomenon.”",1.1733333333333333
178,Varsentha,"What makes first gen different from other groups?

Quoted from article:
First-generation students are often raised with communal values, relying on other people rather than seeing them as rivals. When this meets the competitive, individualistic world of STEM courses, it can have a particularly detrimental impact.
&lt;end quote&gt;

There's a lot of introverts in STEM fields and lots more men than women. Imagine an extrovert in a room full of introverts. The room has a totally different atmosphere than a balanced room or room of mostly extroverts. 

That awkwardness compounds with race, gender, religious and class or wealth differences.

The rivalry talked about in the article I would contribute to meritocracy; it creates competitiveness and narcissism across all fields.",0.7933333333333333
183,kigster,"I think that an experience such as this instills the confidence alongside “I can achieve anything” if I try hard enough principles and should be an inspiration to both first- and many-generational students. It’s not students fault if they come from a privileged family, but nothing justifies entitled behavior and for the kids that are entitled universities are often a rude awakening unless they are corrupt and can be influenced by money and prestige from the rich families. 

But I think it should be a no-brainer that folks going to university, being the first generation in their family, experience impostor syndrome. It seems self evident to the point where Universities should have social programs to support such students given their lack of family support structure around the college experience, and making lasting decisions as to what to study and how to graduate. 

I hope you fulfill this and many other dreams after with the same aplomb, and please keep proving everyone wrong. People like you change the world for the better.",1.14
191,TheBlueArcadian,"Yeah I could definitely attest to this as a first generation college student. It's really freaking hard. For one I have to fill out all my information out myself, my mom being dead and my father not in my life. It made it super difficult to understand especially when I had to talk to my grandmother about it. She obviously came from a generation where many people would just start working after high school. 

You face a bunch of challenges like people telling you constantly, it's a scam you can make the same money without college blah blah blah. Which makes you feel especially awful if you're taking out loans or paying out of pocket. Then you have this idea where if you don't do instantly well you don't belong. Maybe everyone else is right maybe you're destined to do manual labor for the rest of your life. You can get by with that. 

Every bad grade is just another reason you shouldn't be here, every time you question your major every time something gets harder. And you want to rely on your family but either they're not sympathetic or they don't understand. 

It's why I dropped out about 2 years ago after constantly failing. I started college before I was even ready, it was nothing how I thought it would be I was dealing with severe depression and at the time I felt truly truly hopeless. This is just my experience but I returned in Fall of 2018 and I've been doing great since then I still have a lot of the same problems but I think I've run into way better professors that understand that struggle. Like I remember the first semester I made the dean's list I nearly cried. Now I have one more year before my associates and I've been thinking of schools to apply to with a whole group of people supporting me throughout the way",2.14
221,rdear,"I graduated with a degree in physics and have taught myself all sorts of programming languages. I’ve worked as a developer and made several applications that have led to a few promotions.

Ive taught myself a lot about electronics and electrical engineering. I’ve created several devices that my university still use for wireless diagnostics.

I have taught Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Python workshops several times a semester for the past 5 years and I’ve been asked to go to conferences to teach workshops on arduino and I’ve even taught a college level embedded electronics course.

I’ve have been asked to be the sole hardware/software mentor for a Hackathon and always get recognized for what I know and how much I help, and love to help, the students who participate.

I have many times opted to not apply for jobs and have a near constant feeling that everyone around me knows more about the things I’m passionate about and feel like I know. 

As recently as this week, I was tutoring someone in JavaScript and upon realizing how much they were struggling with concepts I found basic and simple, I realized how much “I know”. This happens about once every other week or so. I cannot seem to shake the fact that there’s nothing special or unique or worth while about the things I’ve learned and can do. Not in a negative way though. More in a way that I don’t feel specially qualified for my ability to boil water. Everyone can do that. Why would I put that on a resume.

I’m 35. I was the first in my family to go college so this rings true for me at least.",1.8733333333333333
238,polkaICE,"Being the first in me extended family to graduate with a degree, applied mathematics, it eases my mind a bit to read this. My younger siblings went through college and the life after college with a much more positive and reassurance in their abilities than I did. This imposter syndrome almost kept me from graduating college at the end because I felt like I just wasn’t smart enough to finish. I did finish, but the life after has been a struggle because I have never had the confidence to go for the higher paying jobs or the jobs that require the subject knowledge of my degree because I feel incompetent. 

Also, as some other comments have pointed out, my siblings had my guidance and life experiences for what to expect and how to navigate a lot of “college stuff”. I was able to help them and they had me as a reference point for what doing it “right” was like. I had none of that, and missed out on a lot of opportunities and experiences because I didn’t know they were available to me or how to go about to get them.",1.28
283,C-O-N,"I'm doing my PhD at the moment and struggle with imposter syndrome. So does every other student, and post doc, and PI, and professor, and everybody else. It took a while to get used to it but there are two things I do when I'm having the ""they'll find out I'm a fraud"" feeling. First, I remind myself that every single person around me no matter how high up they are have the exact same feelings. Second, I have what I call a brag folder on my computer that contains all of my achievements. It has copies of my degrees, transcripts, awards and any praise I have in written form. I go through it and it helps remind me that I do deserve to be where I am.

I hope this helps a bit.",0.8933333333333333
289,roarkish,"I was a 1st gen college student, and grew up pretty poor. 

The thing that really made me feel like an imposter more than anything was seeing the level of wealth around me (even if it was fake wealth in the form of huge loans/debts)

The amount of students who said their parents are paying, their parents bought them a car, they live in the dorms and have a free schedule because they don't have to work, or that they could just sleep all day, go to class, and then hang out was so different from my situation. 

Meanwhile, I worked 30 hours a week, with a 15 credit-hour class load, lived at home and drove a jalopy to school and didn't have time to 'chill' with my peers. 

It really drove home how different I was and it felt impossible to make friends because I felt so different. 

Then, my family also had no idea how to support me because they barely graduated from high school. 

I really felt isolated and the imposter part came in when I felt like I didn't fit in anywhere, just pretended.",1.2533333333333334
294,blades318,"I had a technical communication class where our teacher would grade based on what she liked from other people's projects. For example, she never mentioned need a specific type of graph. My group didn't do that type of graph but two groups did. She took a way point because she thought their way of presenting the data was better. 

It comes down to the professor, the department, your college, and your university. The English department didn't allow that but the college that the department of belongs which is  CLASS (College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences) did. This allowed the Techinal Communication ,which is a part of CLASS, to do so. The College of business does not. 

While other university in the area didn't allow this for any of their college/schools to this.",0.8866666666666667
306,cwhitt91,"This makes a lot of sense to me. I used to teach high school English to students who came from lower income households. Statistically, these kids were less likely to attend college based on lots of external “at risk” factors, especially a lower level of emotional intelligence that could stem from a variety of causes. In my experience, and to get more to the point, I’ve seen a lower level of self esteem in these kids because they had a belief about what their self worth was. If any other teachers are reading this, make sure you acknowledge how capable your kids are if they are truly smart enough to attend college. External validation is HUGE for these at risk kids, and if they are smart enough to go to college, they deserve to go.",0.9
309,Zod_42,"Stay in school.  It'll give you a good foundation, and very importantly the networking connections for a solid start.  Focus on the fundamentals. Learn to learn, and adapt.  The technologies in this field change so fast that being able to learn on the fly is a must. Learn a little bit about the jobs of those you'll be working with.  I can't tell you how useful understanding a bit about marketing is.  It allows you to head them off before they make a clusterfuck if your site(s). It'll also help you promote your own work. Also, take a break every now and again. Super long coding sessions are nothing to brag about, and only lead to mistakes, and burnout in the long run. Hope this helps, and good luck.",0.86
320,nrkyrox,"Well to be fair, imposter syndrome is what you encounter after you graduate and realize that unless you became a chartered engineer, you're never going to get any hands-on work with any tech, and you're gonna become a glorified business analyst or project manager. In Australia, there's no jobs left as technicians, because they all went to India, and now there's a shortage of industry-trained low-level engineers/technicians to do breakfix work on servers. Self-trained because your tech company outsourced all it's midlevel technicians and you wanted to do that job but never did? Oh well, sorry, we need someone with more experience.
I'm an entry-level technician with ten years experience doing the first two years of a support and breakfix role, with enough industry certs to make it look like I've got more experience than I really have, but can't get another job to get back in to tech for the life of me (so I bit the bullet and took a customer service job in the rail industry).",1.1266666666666667
358,MI-Native,"Yeah, and it also seems to follow you into your career life.  I work in an industry, at the moment, which is a good 'ol boys network.  Lots of folks who've been in the biz for generations.  And my company does a lot of recruiting out of college, and most of our interns are kids whose parents either work for our company in a senior management/executive capacity, or at another firm.  Some of these interns are so much better versed than me, because they've grown up hearing about this industry for the past 20 odd years, while I just broke into it less than four years ago.  

There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that growing up poor, being a first gen college grad, has offered me significant opportunities I wouldn't have otherwise had, but at great cost to my psychological well-being.  I've always felt 10 steps behind everyone else and as if I don't belong doing what I'm doing.  But I'm also a very humble, and honest individual (probably comes with the territory of growing up poor), so I also struggle with the idea of ""faking it till you make it"".  While I've been relatively good at staying afloat in my career, I've dealt with a lot of anxiety and depression along the way which I think is mostly based in self-doubt.",1.4933333333333334
367,ToTacoOrNotToTaco,"Schools should begin working on this. My state school’s administration suggested I attend a trade school because of a couple of bad semesters. I took the advice of a professor who suggested I stick it out and read up on the challenges of first generation students. That was a life-changing conversation that let me name my problem and identify proven strategies for mitigating the issues I faced. It turned out ok for me but I was lucky, many students flame out without the guidance from home second generation students receive. 

This issue has increasingly made me want to return to  school and learn more about upward mobility minus my personal anecdote. I am absolutely positive if I were, I’d quickly find my opinions biased and full of holes.",0.8533333333333334

Hell, I'm the CTO and I still feel it.

I work with families who are experiencing multigenerational poverty mental health addictions etc. Low social determinants of health couple with high rates of morbidity.

The team addresses all the things that we feel help combat this taking deep roots. Fashionable clothing cell phone computer and internet at home stable housing.

376,candydaze,"Yes! 

Additionally, if they’re not happy with your performance, they will tell you, and give you ample opportunities to improve, and help you improve before firing you. And sure that process is stressful, but it’s never going to be a surprise. 

A few guys in my graduate year were fired - because they spent a solid month bullying a group of female colleagues, and doing pretty much every example in the “bullying and harassment” mandatory training we had to do when starting. Even then, they weren’t fired straight away, but after they’d had a chance to show that they were willing to improve. One guy did, the others didn’t. So the first guy still has his job",0.78

Still being in the early part of my engineering degree, I feel like this ALL the time. Just having made it to calculus 2 this semester after crawling my way all the way up from developmental math 2, I'm constantly feeling like I definitely don't belong in this high level math class.

390,chronic_self-loather,"So I'm a young first gen college graduate, my dad joined the military as soon as he could and my mom dropped out at 16. I never really understood how different I was until I started hanging out with people in the same major as me (Marine Science). I always felt like I missed a crucial stage growing up where my interests would've been nurtured. Most of my studies I just did independently. I hated my teachers in high school because they only seemed to provide their helping hands to the kids who needed it least. I grew a bit of an unhealthy resentment to the preppy kids in my angst-ridden phase. I never really thought of going to college, it wasn't talked about, even with my other siblings. I just kind of wound up there and more or less, ended up winging it. Fast forward a few years and I am succeeding as best I can in classes and still feel like I'm missing something despite usually being near the top of most of my classes, doing climate change research as an undergraduate, leading study sessions with people in the honors college at my university and having many intelligent and motivating friends winning prestigious scholarships. I always felt like I got the concepts of the classes but everybody else seemed to understand the networking and scholarship and opportunity aspects of college. I graduated from a big school with my degree, my peers thought very highly of me, but I always felt less than everyone else. I felt like everyone else had a plan, knew what they were doing. So fast forward some more and here I am. I finally got my first good job in my field and I never really felt more out of place than here. I want to fit in, everybody is so nice, professional and scholarly. All I know how to do is memorize information and regurgitate it on a test and somehow do well. It just feels weird. Maybe it's a confidence thing? I know I can do whatever is needed to be done, I just don't know if I have any thing new to offer or worthwhile to contribute.",2.44
394,BigTunaTim,"I have bad news and good news.

The bad news is that you're right, you most likely don't have many skills for the real working world. 

The good news is that very few employers are going to hire a new graduate and sit them down and tell them ""work"" with no guidance or training. You can avoid the few that do simply by asking in interviews what kind of onboarding training they do. Even if you do end up in one of those places somehow, you'll have coworkers that you can ask for help. And in the worst case after a few months you have experience on a resume and can start over elsewhere.

But perhaps most importantly, the mixed-blessing news. The fact that you're worried about this now means you're missing out on truly enjoying the last bit of what is probably one of the best times of your life. But it also proves you have the internal motivation that is critical to succeeding.

397,Stepwolve,"yeah this seems like a really self-evident study.   When you are the first in your family to go to university, there is no one in your family who can fully understand the situation or give advice about it.     
  
university is a weird and crazy experience for everyone, but its much less stressful when your family can tell you ""dont worry, that normal"".    Being the first in your family to go to university it a huge deal and a lot of pressure to succeed, but when you are the 27th in your extended family to go to university the pressure is much smaller.    
  
I also think a big factor is going to university expecting it to be a super-challenging world filled with career-driven, smart people.   And the reality is that university is filled with drunk kids who often forget to go to class.  That disconnect is tough when you are the hope of your family and other students dont care much about school",1.08

I’d never heard of imposter syndrome before a couple years ago but it definitely describes how I feel. My manager has noticed and recommended I do some assertiveness training to help compensate.

The professors at university are lower quality and care about as much or less than the students that aren’t gunning for top grad school spots.

I feel like education doesn’t scale well as an institution. The less students the more likely to get smaller class sizes and professors that aren’t stretched out so much that they can’t focus on how to actually create the conditions for students to begin to grasp esoteric material.

Learning styles are different for everyone and I get that as young adults, students should know what works best for them, but at the end of the day it’s the institutions responsibility that students can question, reason, and think.

429,Karmaflaj,"I think the issue of expectations and representation is important. I grew up in a family where going to university was just expected,  My dad had gone to uni. I knew from age 12 or so that the outcome of high school was merely picking which degree I would do. So I would just take note of things about university that appeared or that were discussed, learnt study habits, thought about which office job I would want to do. My friends were almost all the same (I went to a very middle class school). When I got to uni it was no big deal, I had friends there from school, I had years of background as to what to expect. I even knew what degree I would be doing about 3 years ahead of time and what university (I’m Australian so the process is a bit different)

At Uni I became friends with someone who grew up on a farm. He didn’t really know anyone who had even been to uni. He hasn’t expected to go but did unexpectedly well at school and his dads farm was really struggling financially and perhaps had no long term future. So he suddenly had to switch his entire mindset from being a ‘learn on the job’ farm manager to doing (as it was) business studies in a city surrounded by city kids who had parents who could offer knowledgeable advice and support and understanding (and financial support in many cases). He was able to do the work but struggled mentally just as you did. (He graduated and got a job with a rural supplier - turns out that accountants with farming experience are highly sought after!)

I don’t know that’s it’s bullshitting necessarily, it’s just that people who have grown up in a culture surrounded by people they can see have done the same things are more comfortable in that culture. Just like someone who grows up in NYC is more comfortable in NYC that someone who grew up in nowheresville Nebraska will be in NYC

Tldr: background and representation really matters to a person believing they can achieve something",2.38
440,Alien_Way,"tl;dr: A poorly written too-personal ramble from some internet rando that adds nothing to the conversation.

I've got.. something like this. No need for university, I prefer to hide at home because I fear ""the public"" judging me, basic recluse/hermit stuff.. except I know I won't be judged in any way (that I'd know about, since I don't care about people talking behind my back as long as I never hear it, heh). I haven't been yelled at or told I look like crap or to get a haircut etc. in over 20 years, but the fear/anxiety still wants to dictate every decision.

I'm poor, and feel like there's only so many ""seats at the table"" and I don't deserve whatever amount of money ""enough"" is. I'm definitely poisoned with laziness and/or procrastination too, for a lot of reasons I'm mostly aware of (having to clean other's messes, having to approach problems without proper supplies/tools/knowledge, unwilling to ""rally a team"" or ask for help from others, pain from spine issues and being a giant, embarrassment or looking like an idiot), which all reinforces that ""You don't deserve anything."" feeling.

And *then*, growing up, watching the couple times my father came close to breaking poverty's stranglehold on us and something always happened to drag us back in (first time some pheasants we were trying to breed burned our house down, second time a tornado led to my father's death via heart attack at 48), both happened after he'd received financial ""good luck"" that might have moved us out of some really old ruts, which was (and still is) demotivating.

Lots more to it. I'm disabled and I *have* had someone tell me in the past couple months that *they* ""pay for me"", to which I had to tell them I have a ""rich"" aunt that runs an appliance business. She won't help me out financially, but she definitely pays enough taxes that an almost-total stranger doesn't get the right to claim I owe them something (or they somehow bought the right to treat me like less than a person).

I don't want meds, or counseling, and even if I wanted counseling I despise leaving the house and have very, very limited access to a vehicle (and that vehicle has temporary/paper sale tags on it from October 2019 that we still won't be able to make legal for another couple months of high-intensity stress and risk of taking on a surprise fine or fee we can't pay). I'd like to think I'm aware of most of ""the problem"" too, which admittedly hasn't helped much, and I doubt I can be motivational-speeched or organized back into confidence, which makes me think it's probably a chemical or two I'm either shy on or overloaded on. I'm 0% violent, 0% angry, so overall I guess it's an ""imbalance"" I'm alright with, considering the opposite.

I feel bad for swatting a fly, too, seriously. I think about birth, and how I didn't get a Character Creation screen where I went ""Eh, better not be a fly or a snake or a spider, don't want beat to death.."", and I think about how I just destroyed a perfectly healthy, innocent creature that was only doing its job (and the fly is *much* better at being a fly than I am at being a human). I over-think before I speak. I try to walk 3 miles in someone else's shoes, not just one. I try to ""understand"" people probably because I'm so hung up on the fear of being shallowly judged. Of course, none of this does much good when you're happier hiding from everyone. My stomach turns to garbage during tense situations too, and I'll avoid giving even constructive criticism out of fear of saying the wrong thing or it being taken as non-constructive. Another thing to note is all this stuff mostly applies to the ""real world"" and not the internet.. even though I get anxious when I see people have responded to my posts every time I see the notification. Is ""extreme, crippling empathy"" a thing? I don't want to ""be competitive"", if survival of the fittest and bouncing off of other people's heads and hard work to ""move up"" is the measurement I shouldn't have made it past 17 years old.

I also ramble, and try to over-explain, but that's probably unrelated. Anyway, lots of circumstances have led my brain to believe the safest thing to do is to find the bottom of the barrel and lay down flat on it, so you can't fall down anymore. Problem is, at the bottom, *everything* is falling down all the time. The car tags, the microwave and fridge that've been out of commission for months now that we can't afford to replace, a huge mud pit pothole that's now wider than our driveway that floods our front yard with almost constant mud and does excess vehicle damage, a couple dozen various repair jobs/patches that need applied.

I've got ""capitalism"" hangups too, maybe because I thought about being an ""artist"" of some kind, until I learned how awful ""commercial art"" is, and how hard you have to work to find a job in it, and how there'll probably always be someone else that'll work faster and cheaper than you (and produce a better product). Being a poor kid who drew on paper when the world was shifting to digital art didn't help, either. I could maybe make a few bucks doing commission drawings today, but I've got no actual experience (or hardware, beyond a mouse). Confidence check after confidence check, and I ended up failing them. First time I recall being blown out of the water was in 5th grade during a drawing contest where I did a nice neon underwater/ocean scene, but lost to a guy that, *in 5th grade*, did a professional/realistic drawing of a combat helicopter, and it (coupled with Mortal Kombat) made me fully aware that there will always be someone better than you, and if you end up competing against them you stand no chance.. and then there's someone better than *them*.. and *then* there's the possibility that the kid's parent drew the helicopter for them and what I thought was defeat was actually just regular old underhanded deceit.. Not to get political, but I also live in a ""red state"" that has ""at-will"" firing for employers, so they can fire you with no reason given whatsoever a couple days before you qualify for benefits. That's a fun bit of legislation!

I'm quietly wondering if I'm not spiraling towards homelessness, and there lies another huge source of fear/anxiety: that people from Hurricane Katrina are still living in tents *today*, and that while there's ""help"", there's never enough. I know one single mother that *died* after waiting and praying for over 20 years for help from HUD that wouldn't have came even if she had lived another 20 years, and single mothers are given priority.  I've looked into housing assistance for disabled people and found out that it's either infinite waiting lists like HUD, or you get accepted there and find out it's a nightmare living situation the landlords are probably in only for the tax cuts. It's also where I first saw the phrase ""zero-bedroom apartment"". I wonder how many people read Tales of Woe like this and it only makes them grip their money tighter, too, in fear of ending up this way. They don't call zero dollars ""broke"" for nothing, and it definitely helps reinforce my feeling of being scum.

Anyway, imposter, anxiety, just a mess of jumbled cross wires, or a cocktail of all three, I don't know. Thought I'd ramble a little since my entire existences has been an exercise in feeling unworthy while under multiple suffocating blankets of stress. And now that I'm done typing comes the urge to just delete it all and move on, which I usually do.. but today I'll post this wall of text, against my stomach's protests.",8.9
443,YaztromoX,"&gt; Getting a degree now is more than anything just proving you have a smart brain.

It's more than that.  Having a degree shows you can stick to something that is (likely, for most) challenging.  It _implies_ that you can set deadlines and can be self-organizing.  It also somewhat implies that you can work and organize your thoughts under pressure (think examinations).

Getting your degree means you didn't give up when things got hard.  It means you had the drive to do the work necessary to pass.  It means you most likely spent late nights at the library or the lab getting assignments done, or prepping for exams.  You survived the stress of deadlines and examinations, and were able to succeed even with these stresses present.

Being smart is an advantage, but it only gets you part way there.  Having a smart brain but no drive, or the inability to meet deadlines, or to function under pressure doesn't tend to equate to university/college success.  You also have to have the skills to see projects and assignments and degree programmes through to the end.",1.22

An important thing to remember is that almost no one comes out of a degree knowing how to work in the real world. Essentially the entirety of the first 6 months is you getting use to it.

There is a certain way that affluent and upper middle class people conduct themselves and raise their ilk up.  Those kids entering into college tend to be better prepared, better read, and well ahead of the curve in many cases.  Their parents push them towards educational endeavors; talk to them about how the world works and how to work the world in their favor; and encourage them to explore, be curious, lead, and venture out on their own.  I was lucky if my parents had the budget for me to play little league baseball.

So as the poor kid growing up being surrounded by all these kids at an elite academic institution, you start to feel like you don't belong with these people.

Stats will likely get into a calculus based view of it, and even counting things can get remarkably complicated.

Sure, but as I said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/em9t4e/firstgeneration_university_students_the_first_in/fdnihnm/?context=3) that makes sense only if all classes were equal. Freshman and sophomore classes are designed to achieve different results from 3rd and 4th year classes; moreover, program-required entry-level courses are different than first year general ed., and introductory courses (i.e. special topic, low-level courses like ""American Foreign Policy"" as a first year course). Not all classes are created equal, and course loads are going to have a very different effect. By their very nature, skills-based courses are individualistic as they focus on rote memorization and skills assessments. By 3rd and 4th year, students should have developed the skills and focused on critical thinking/reasoning and applied skills - those are inherently different types of courses. 

By focusing on first and second year courses, there's no way to really know how those feelings change - are they stronger in first year than second? Do they get stronger over time? *How* different are they in actuality? We're told that there's a difference, but how different are they?

Angular momentum is formally the conserved quantity of an SO(N) symmetry.

Angular momentum also tells you about the transformation properties of a system. If you tell me the angular momentum of a system and you perform a rotation of that system, I can tell you what it looks like after the rotation.

In mechanics, angular momentum is the rotational analogue to (linear) momentum. Linear momentum p=mv tells you how hard it is to change v with some acceleration F=ma=dp/dt. Angular momentum tells you how hard it is to change a bodies rotation when torquing it as Tau=dL/dt with angular momentum L.

That means they are talking about an interaction effect not a flat effect.

Furthermore, the study is just correlational but still tries to argue causation. Students are NOT randomized to their courses and the courses are NOT randomized as to their level of competetiveness. The authors don't account for the obvious effect of ""course outcome"" on ""imposter feelings"" and ""Perceived classroom competition"". Instead, they simply assume that the effect is unidirectional from ""imposter feelings"" to ""course outcome"", which is obviously nonsense. The biggest reason why you might feel like an imposter could be that you actually are an imposter. Hence, they do not really look at imposter syndrome because this includes the condition that you aren't an actual imposter.

You can't shake the voice inside saying there's no way you deserved this.  Other people who had better stats got rejected, so this must have been a mistake.  Maybe they gave you way too much credit for your essays, or your URM status, or something.  Whatever the reason, you didn't earn this, and you're way over your head in a place you don't belong.  How will you cope with the guilt, cratered self-esteem, and nagging doubt?

1.  If you're feeling out of place or like you have major imposter syndrome, first recognize that this is a good thing.  It means you're doing so well for yourself that you feel out of place being so awesome and successful.  Success is what you make it, not how you feel compared to your peers.  So don't let it bother you.  Instead, you should feel good about having achieved so much and attained something great, regardless of whether or not you ""deserved"" it.

2.  This may shock you, but there's really only one reason you got in - they wanted you there.  And that alone means you deserve it.  Admission is holistic, so even if your GPA/SAT/ECs or whatever weren't the best in their admitted class, you had other things they loved.  Top schools receive tens of thousands of applicants and deny ~90% of them.  Many of those 90% were probably ""more academically qualified"" than you.  But they wanted you. 

3.  There are some 50 people fully engaged in the admissions process at most top schools.  These people are the world's foremost experts on their admissions, what they look for, how they decide who ""deserves"" it, etc.  **And they chose you.**  If JK Rowling tells you how to interpret a certain passage of Harry Potter, do you question her and instead trust your friend who just read it for the first time last week?  If Jennifer Doudna, Emmanuelle Charpentier, and Feng Zhang explain something about CRISPR to you, do you instead trust your peers who ""totally aced"" AP Biology?  If Katie Bouman tells you how to take a picture of a black hole, do you instead trust some people in your class who just got an SLR and telescope and are now experts on astronomical photography?  That would be asinine, worthless, lame, anti-vax, flat-earth BS.  Those people are not only the top experts on those subjects, they own them.  Every nuance and detail is meticulously shepherded and it's all entirely under their purview.  I'm struggling to even express how ridiculous it is for someone to second guess this or say they know better than the admissions office when it comes to their own admissions process.

4.  One of the lesser known facts about college admissions is that a few points on your GPA or SAT aren't really that big of a deal.  Colleges will often take an applicant with lower stats because of something else interesting or compelling in their application.  Maybe they have a unique and valuable skill.  Maybe they just seem like a really incredible person.  Maybe their achievements are indicative of a much higher ceiling.  Sure, a 1500 is going to be viewed very differently from a 1200, but it's not that different from a 1550 and many colleges even use SAT bands instead of actual scores in their rubrics because they don't want to use a microscope on it or overemphasize a few meaningless multiple choice questions.  

5.  Your job is not to justify getting in, it's to make the most of it now that you've earned this amazing opportunity.  You don't need to justify it to anyone **not even yourself**.  So stop trying.  Instead just focus on being the best you.  I'm going to say that again a little louder for the folks in back:

#You do not need to justify this to anyone, NOT EVEN YOURSELF.

6\.  Recognize that imposter syndrome never really goes away.  You will probably feel it at your first job out of college, after every promotion, after you start your own company, after you get elected, or whatever else you achieve.  Research indicates that even the very best people in the world at what they do still feel imposter syndrome, regardless of how accomplished they are.  So recognize that you're not alone.  Part of this comes from being the world's foremost expert on your own weaknesses, but it's not your incompetence or inadequacy or even your insecurity driving this - it's your humanity.  So don't feel like this sensation is bad or wrong or indicative of a problem.  It just means you're a real person just like everyone else.  Embrace it, lean into it, and let that nervous energy empower you.  Learn to live with being a better person than you think you have any right to be - it just means you're awesome.",5.6

After 4 years of schooling I thought I would at least know a bit of the technology I would be working with, but almost everything I was told I had to use was new to me at the time. 

Turns out that schooling doesn't teach anywhere near everything you need for an actual work environment, but did give a good base set of knowledge and the skills to learn new stuff quickly when needed.

The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, but the second best time is now. Just focus on what you can do moving forward. 

Caesar didn’t start his political career until 31. Arnold Schwarzenegger didn’t start acting until his 30s. Bezos started amazon at 31 years old. I’m sure 31 was a big number for others that I can’t remember right now. But there are numerous other examples throughout history through to today of people who hit the ground running in their 30s or older and did amazing things. Most people generally perform their best and most effective work in middle age. I mean sure athletes peak young, but most people don’t hit their most effective or highest paying years until after their twenties.

And if you're a person who ever following this feeling had people get jealous of you and attack you for ""having too much"" you know that it is actually a legitimate fear/feeling not and not something just in your head or some sort of disorder.

1346,sordfysh,"I really think that the imposter syndrome is a good thing is some respects.

Those who admit to having imposter syndrome are typically people who strive to keep learning more. They don't feel adequate because the knowledge they can learn never stops. You can often count on these people to become experts in their field.

On the other hand, the imposter syndrome often stops people from driving their agenda-- merely because they don't feel confident in their abilities. It can be a major loss because they might not advocate for their project even though their project could have the greatest ROI. And if there are inefficiencies in internal processes, they might avoid pushing for change, merely because they are afraid to rock the boat.

Therefore, you more often find management that has the reverse of the imposter syndrome, and entitlement complex. They think that people should be listening to them because they feel confident in themselves (even if they have little actual competency). And when people actually do listen to them (possibly to their own detriment), it validates their beliefs in themselves.

If you have the imposter syndrome, you might eventually feel walked-on. You might ask yourself why you let people step on your toes. It could be because you don't want to rock the boat because you can't survive if you get thrown off of the boat. LEARN TO SWIM WITHOUT THE BOAT. If you can, see if you can gain the skills of the people who support your skills. Once you learn to do what you do as a one-person operation, you won't be as scared to get thrown off of the boat. 

Once you gain this independence in your work, you will find yourself rocking the boat a lot more, and you may find that people will start to listen. And you will certainly make some enemies (if you are doing it right), but you will find yourself innovating a lot more and making connections that other people *cannot* make. You will be able to provide things to people that cost you very little but are invaluable to them, and they may repay you with incredible loyalty. You may find yourself no longer being merely hired by a company, but instead partnering or merging with the company.

And that is how you go from being part of a business, to being a businessman, to being a business, man. The imposter syndrome is a good innate quality to have. It shows you aren't content with the status quo. Now learn to do something about it.",2.8466666666666667

In hindsight, I was almost certainly in a state of depression/anxiety when I was completing my postgrad and looking for my first professional job, and if you haven't applied for any out of a sense of hopelessness, you might be too. 

Apply, tell yourself you are just doing it for the feedback or interview experience if you need to, but you might surprise yourself and worst case you'll be in exactly the same position you are in now. 

Don't worry about meeting every criteria either. I once saw an ad HR sent out for my replacement after I gave notice. It desired experience on a bunch of software we didn't have nor planned on getting, so I asked about it and they had used a proforma for the position they had on file. You don't know about this stuff until you get to talk to someone in the department (who often don't write the criteria). If you feel like you are missing anything critical for a job, you can pick up the basics of almost anything through an online course. Do the course, learn the basics, put the skill on your CV.

Try not to take any rejections to heart. Lots of jobs are prefilled internally and are only advertised due to policy or have dozens of applicants. You might have been screened by an AI, so maybe no human even looked. It probably wasn't you.

1466,Clewin,"Programming as a field really hasn't been around that long in the whole scheme of things, so you probably aren't alone. Many of my fellow students in the 1990s had never used computers. I was an exception, having learned BASIC and Apple ][ assembly in the 1980s, but everything switched fast. Really what you need to learn is generally entirely covered in coursework, which is not specific computer languages, but rather concepts. Learning how an array or string works, learning how pointers work (even if the language builds them in), learning concepts like stack space vs heap space. Concurrent programming and issues like the Dining Philosopher's Problem. These things are vastly more important than the programming languages themselves - once you know those things, looking up how to do them in a particular language becomes a Stack Overflow search.",0.9266666666666666
1470,legato_gelato,"I think it's more about people's ability to think logically and drive to learn it in general. It's obviously tougher for someone who doesn't know what programming even is than someone who did it from childhood, but from my experience the courses goes past that very quickly, so someone can be better than most of them by ""just"" following the curriculum for maybe 1 - 1.5 years at which point most stuff is new to everybody.

Only saying this to not discourage people who want to study cs but get discouraged from reading your experience.

I think people should try it beforehand just a tiny bit though, some simple stuff like following a tutorial and writing some text to the screen, just to understand what a program even is, but no reason to study in-depth beforehand. At least from my experience.",0.94

1485,SolidSnake_Foxhound,"I can relate to this very strongly. My parents were immigrants, I'm of the first gen to go to college. I've often struggled with feelings of inadequacy and not belonging, even when I was praised or had a solid friend group. It's very interesting how classroom atmosphere is a key driver because I never felt that personally. My professors and classroom atmospheres seemed very collaborative and collegial, but I often felt not smart enough or not good enough to be close to people. Maybe that was the competitive thinking in me turned inward. It also reminds me of Carol Dweck's Growth Mindset, maybe I was clinging to an idea of myself being the smart guy because that's how my parents valued me and I was scared to have that sense of value challenged if all these other classmates saw that I wasn't that smart to their standards.  

I thought depression had some effect, I was kind of depressed in my first year of university and it's hard for me to say if it's correlated with imposter feelings or caused it or vice versa, or if it's a vicious cycle. I have several first gen cousins who all dropped out of college because of depression and feelings of being lost (their words), but now I wonder if imposter syndrome better explains what they were feeling. Also, as a first gen I don't just belittle myself against my classmates but I also beat myself up mentally for not having the ingenuity and drive my parents have, so it's like competition with the idea of a glorified past, always forgetting that they had to learn along the way and people helped them too.",1.8666666666666667

It’s kind of ironic though. I had the real-world understanding of why the math was important, but a poor grasp on the math. Most people would say that’s not a bad starting point, but I felt out of place and like I didn’t belong. 

Now that I’m older, I’ve learned that I’m not so bad off. I won’t be a straight-A student, but classmates will come to me on occasion for straightforward explanations and comparisons to real-life stuff, because I DO have that experience.

&gt; First-Generation University Students Are At Greater Risk Of Experiencing Imposter Syndrome


&gt; But, a new study suggests, the competitive nature of STEM courses may be having a knock-on effect on the confidence of certain students, in this case first-generation college attendees (those who are the first in their family to go to university). Such students, the paper argues, are more likely to experience “imposter syndrome” — the feeling that they don’t belong or don’t have the skills or intelligence to continue on their studies — precisely because of this atmosphere of competition.

Abstract

Many college students intend to pursue science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers but quickly abandon these goals when confronted with notoriously competitive STEM courses that often pit students against each other. This emphasis on interpersonal competition could be especially detrimental for first-generation (FG) college students, an underrepresented group in STEM fields which more strongly values communality and collaboration relative to their continuing-generation peers. Thus, FG students may experience more imposter feelings in STEM courses perceived as having a competitive culture. A longitudinal study (with 818 students and 2,638 experience-sampling observations) found that perceived classroom competition was associated with greater daily in-class imposter feelings among all students—but especially among FG students. Imposter feelings in turn predicted students’ end-of-term course engagement, attendance, dropout intentions, and course grades. Classroom competition and the imposter feelings it engenders may be an overlooked barrier for promoting the engagement, performance, and retention of FG students in STEM.",2.046666666666667
