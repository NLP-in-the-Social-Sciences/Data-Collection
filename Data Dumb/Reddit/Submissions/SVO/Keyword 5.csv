0,Combzz,1641702756,/r/college/comments/rzjfdy/study_while_volunteering_abroad_leveraging_100/,"I was looking at volunteering opportunities near me locally (Florida) so I could serve on the weekends. But while doing so, I had an idea and was curious to see if it was possible to study *WHILE* volunteering abroad? This is NOT to be confused with a work study program where one needs to be admitted to a foreign college program while still needing to cover various costs.

This likely seems like a fool's dream, but I'm wondering if it's *theoretically* possible to find a long-term volunteer abroad opportunity where the organization covers my travel, room &amp; board, food, small stipend, etc. in exchange for working 8 hours days toward a volunteer mission - similar to a Peace Corp structure.

During my downtime while volunteering abroad, I can then commit to focusing on my full-time studies which is 100% online. I started community college recently, my institution offering a hybrid/full online model. After planning all my classes for the next 2 years, I realized my entire CompSci associates degree can be completed 100% online (many of the courses are able to be completed at-your-own-pace without the need for Live class meetings or bandwidth heavy Zoom meetings).

Due to this extreme school flexibility and ability to withdraw Federal Student Loans + Pell Grant each semester, if I could find a volunteer abroad opportunity that somehow gives me access to an internet connection 2-3 days a week allowing me to complete my studies at the end of each day, I would take it in a heartbeat and spend 1-2 years abroad up until my associates is finished. This volunteer experience can help to add to my resume, provide greater cultural appreciation, cover living expenses while having the ability to access student loans if needed, and allow me to work full-time on my degree goals - a definitive win on most fronts.

What can I do?

* Building houses in Tanzania, educating under-served children in Kenya, vaccinating villagers in South Africa, and washing dishes in a soup kitchen in Denmark are all up my alley
* Since I am looking for a career in software engineering, volunteering my software dev/web design work for an organization is also up my alley (organization will keep IP rights and no payment necessary other than living arrangement/expenses abroad are worked out allowing for degree completion).
* Doing small business coaching in struggling villages and/or empowering poverty stricken children/teens by teaching them how to read English or code software is something I can really get behind and be passionate about. I think not teaching American children how to code is becoming our biggest blunder in the 21st century, so empowering children in 3rd world countries with the ability to code and deploy value in an ever-growing GLOBAL job market is their golden key to future success (as an individual AND as a developing country).  

   * **Side thought:** I would find great personal accomplishment if I could teach a small class of aging-out Kenyan teenagers (Compassion International teens for example) how to code and become basic Java/web developers. Then connect them with resources to get hired to work remotely (assist with portfolio creation, setting up freelance profile, interviewing and resume building assistance, Silicon Valley backed DONOR remote job interviews, etc.) using only a $200 computer and internet connection. Seeing a poor 3rd world teen progress in their programming skillset and then go on to make enough money in the digital economy to be able pull their whole family out of generational poverty WHILE staying in their local community and staying in the local economy would be a life treasure (and also a major undiscussed key for developing countries to begin competing in the new digital era and improving their countrys' poverty levels).

If anyone has ideas, please let me know of any organizations or volunteer setups structured this way so that I can pack bags and get my visa ready tonight. I am 25yo with minimal commitments other than my dreaded bills and working 40 hours a week at a job that adds no value to my career. Although, I do have an 7 year professional career behind me (went straight into the workforce before getting serious about college just recently).

1,ireallylike808s,1619562718,/r/college/comments/n00gt3/failed_all_but_one_class_my_graduating_semester/,"Let me just start off by saying I apologize for any typos or poor wording. My skin is broken out in red spots from anxiety and I feel like this is my last day alive on earth...

I was a great student growing up. Except for persistent math class issues, I was in Honors classes, AP, Dean’s list etc. 

I started my freshman year of college at IU Bloomington. Terrible experience, my roomate was such a bum he’d throw his dirty underwear on my bed nonchalantly. I made no friends, my social anxiety went through the roof. Everyone around me did hard drugs. I bombed. When I came back, my parents and I had some of the biggest arguments we ever had. I was diagnosed with major depression and ADHD. They refuse to believe it to this day and call me a loser whenever it gets brought up. 

Despite all this, I bounced back. I went to community college, and performed pretty well attaining A’s and B’s. I finally transferred to Columbia College Chicago starting January 2019 and I felt on top of my game. I consistently got all A’s and B’s, made deans list, and had a cumulative GPA of 3.75! I loved my classes and felt like I was breezing by as a result. 

Not to sound cliche but then COVID hit. Halfway through my first senior semester. I’m pretty ADD as stated before, and finally convinced my family to help get me medication to help me in school and all other aspects of my life. Helped immensely, and still does day to  day. But I started seeing trouble arise when my school switched entirely to online. See I was productive and extremely attentive in class, and was very motivated no matter the subject. Online, being stuck in my computer room all day, with a family who constantly verbally abused each other 24/7 and gets in routine shouting matches made me slip up. Nevertheless, I finished with all A’s and a B that semester. Partially because I had around half my semester in-person which saved me from early demise. 

Here’s where I my issues began. See my dad is really impatient. He’s from Europe and didn’t go to college. He stressed to me over and over again “you have to graduate this year end of story. It’s been too long I want you to load up right the f**k now and  finish.” Upon meeting with my advisor, I had five left to take at Columbia, and I had to complete a math and English class at my old community college which would transfer. 

Except the problem is the summer term of my community college began when my regular college was still in session. This math class (my worst subject) was already 3 weeks in. I had to get a special petition to sign up. My dad was like “DO IT HURRY UP”. I was doomed from the beginning. Being my worst subject, it didn’t help me that there was no instruction. It was just complete the homework and quizzes using the Pearson software. I tried my absolute best. Took so many notes, and would do bad on everything. Even the homework was graded for extreme accuracy. My professor in this class also said it wouldn’t be fair to have me make up any assignments I missed in the 2and a half weeks before I joined the class. 

This was when I had a major panic episode. I couldn’t talk, isolated and just worried to high Heaven. I tuned out. Went ghost. Right as my English class was to begin, which would’ve been super easy for me to pass. 

I mustered up the courage to finally reach out to my teachers and ask for help. Except just my luck the semester ended. So boom. I lost the chance to get the credits for those two classes. Already set up for disaster come the fall semester. 

My classes last semester at Columbia were no different than the classes I had excelled in. Only what happened at my CC loomed over me constantly. My parents constantly asked over and over again if I’m on track to graduate and I’d say yes over and over again. Had I said what happened at my CC I would’ve probably been beaten and tossed out the house. I know lying like this was bad but I have absolutely no way of supporting myself. My dad has access to my bank account, the car I drive is under him, etc. I had a severe bout of depression for the first time in 5 years since my semester at IU to where I completely disassociated from everything. My advisor would try and call me to ask if I was okay, as well as classmates I was in group projects with, and just seeing them reach out made me a nervous sorrowful wreck. I don’t know how to describe it but I couldn’t muster the courage to even respond to them. I’m in the same room day in day out trying to do school in this messed up household and the environment definitely has messed with my head. 

Well I was supposed to graduate assuming I passed those two CC classes and my Major-related classes. Mom was all excited, dad finally showed some sense of pride in me. I was not happy however. Because I didn’t. My one teacher was generous enough to give me a C, I got an F in the four other classes. My GPA is now a 2.7. Remarkably I’m still in “good standing” 

My dad has since insisted i apply for college grad entry level  jobs daily and I have been, using an amended resume where I say I’m short a few credits of graduating. He doesn’t know that. He would ask where my diploma was once or twice a week since January and I would just say “I don’t know yet they take forever to send out”. By the time he threatened me with “I better not have any bad surprises” it was too late. If I can go back in time and tell them during the semester I totally would believe me. 

Well today he lost his sh*t about it. Demanded I show him paperwork that I graduated. Transcripts, degree, something. I said I couldn’t and so he called a lady at my school who said my degree not being here yet was not normal. He sat me down and demanded I come clean. I tested the waters to where I said I may have gotten a C- in a class that was holding me back and he went into a rage. Slamming his fist on his desk, spitting everywhere whilst screaming, calling me a scumbag and that I will never get anything from them again. Broke my heart. Have had a mutually decent relationship for a while now. To have it return to this blows. Said “f you” to me whenever I tried to open my mouth and speak. He made me register an appointment with my old academic advisor for tomorrow at 2:30 where he will be listening along. I stealthily managed to explain to her in the notes when I scheduled the situation. And how he doesn’t understand how difficult it’s been for me. But I’m still worried sick how this is gonna go down. What is she gonna blatantly say I failed everything? I know it’s best to fess up with this stuff but I’m not in the situation where I can be like “oh they’re mad but they love me they’ll understand”. 

What kills me is this wasn’t a result of me being lazy. I literally transgressed into a withering panicked maniac in this house trying to just get my degree. With my family
Home 24/7. My dad used to always travel, kept the family dynamic relatively calm five days a week. Now it’s a shit show almost every day. All these factors have made me a terrible student even with my meds. I’m worried he will stop paying for my ADD meds which have helped me make my bed, rid myself of social anxiety, have a loving girlfriend, etc. mentally I don’t think my brain could handle such a change in chemistry right now. And to think that’s the least of my concerns...

I’ve looked up everything in my school website about Incompletes, getting a waiver for certain requirements, even CLEP tests for the CC classes, but it all feels too late and that I’ll probably now never go back to school again.",college,Failed all but one class my graduating semester last winter.

It is a fairly cheap option, I like the school's culture/student body, pretty good science programs, etc. I am also planning to save any money I make at my job this spring/summer for college.

My absolute dream is to work in marine biology but I realize this is a field that doesn't pay well and it's hard to find a job with just a bachelor's. So I am planning on getting my bachelor's in bio (ecology focus) and then my master's in marine biology in another state (my state doesn't have any schools for marine biology). I'm also planning on moving to Florida after my bachelor's for more career opportunities. 

I'm just wondering if I'm doing the wrong thing here. I know everyone says to study what you enjoy which is what I want to do but money/jobs are still an issue. Should I major in something else like biochemistry that has better job prospects/pay? I am fine with living on a budget as I am used to that growing up in a poor family.

3,TheeAngelness,1600241026,/r/college/comments/itqzgj/should_i_let_my_parents_pay_for_college_or_should/,"Hi, sorry if it’s a little long. 

Before I begin I just want to clarify that by no means do I feel entitled to my parents money. I know my parent’s money are theirs and mine are mine. I’ve also been working consistently since the age of 16 to support my living expenses, and I don’t ask my parents for money. But, recently I’m going through a problem with my FAFSA and it’s been effecting me a bit and I need your opinion on something important. 

At the moment I am a senior in college. I have a year and a half left until I graduate. I’ve never had a problem with financial aid, and they’ve been covering my full tuition consistently for the past 3 years...until this year. Prior to college, my mother would always say that she’ll support me no matter what and that she’ll pay for my tuition. Luckily, I received full coverage so she doesn’t have to...until this year. Now that we found out I may have to pay for college, lately my mother’s been implying that I should pay for them myself. Whenever she ask me about it, she’ll kind of imply it, but occasionally say she can pay for it (hesitantly). 

To be honest, I do have money saved up from the years I’ve been working part time. At the end of the day if I have to pay for it I can. I worked years doing part time at minimum wage jobs while attending school, which slowly allowed me to build up my savings. Financial aid is saying that this year I have 4K due for the fall semester. But, because financial aid is calculated yearly, most likely at the end of the year I will have to pay for 11k out of pocket (Fall+Spring+Summer semester). 

To be honest, I am okay with paying for it in the end because it is my tuition, but I feel a little hurt that my mom went back on her words. It felt like she promised me something and took it away. Growing up she always says that she’ll support my brother and I no matter what. Not to mention, my family isn’t poor at all. To go a little into detail, my mother owns a successful business(she works A LOT) and has a couple of real estate lined up. My brother also dropped out of HS so I’m the only person in the family that’s going for a bachelors degree(both my parents never finished college). 

I don’t know, I guess I’m just wondering what I should do. Should I pay for my tuition with the savings I slowed stashed away throughout the years(I was planning on using it for when I graduate, move out, starting my life, etc.), or should I let my mother pay because she said she would in the past even though she’s hesitate? Maybe I can ask her if we can split it it? Please let me know your opinion! Thanks! 


TLDR: Parent said would pay for my tuition when I first started college, but ended up never having to because financial aid covers it all except for the last year. I am doing my last year. Well off parent went back on her words about paying for my college(ish), is hesitant, but technically I can pay for my own college with the years of savings I saved up from working minimum wage since age 16. Should I let my parent pay for college even though they’re hesitant or should I just go, bite the bullet, and pay it myself because it is my tuition in the end?",college,Should I let my parents pay for college or should I pay for it?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/itqzgj/should_i_let_my_parents_pay_for_college_or_should/,1600259026.0
4,political-whore,1597673904,/r/college/comments/ibez5i/any_tips_to_deal_with_imposter_syndrome/,"Imposter syndrome is basically the feeling that you don't belong somewhere and that you don't fit in. There's a strange fear of being found out and having to deal with that fallout. I feel like I just don't belong at my university because I'm too poor and not smart enough. 

I went to a rural school where it felt like all of our grades got a boost just because it wasn't very competitive. Now in college, no matter how much I study, I get worse grades than my friends that are STEM students (I'm a liberal arts major, so my classes have been way easier than theirs). I love my classes, and I have learned so much, but a year into school, I just feel like I'm not smart enough to be in college, and if people knew the truth, I would just be further separated from everyone. 

My university is also fairly expensive, so a lot of the other students came from really rich families and neighborhoods. I am paying for my own tuition, and I worked all summer to even afford this next semester. I don't go out to restaurants on campus or go shopping with friends because I don't have that kind of money. Meanwhile, my roommate last year got takeout every day and bought a ton of new merchandise every time her family came to visit. I'm not complaining about my situation, because it's what I was dealt in life, but the fear that people are going to realize that I'm too poor to be at college is eating me up. I've talked to my therapist and mom about it, but they don't really understand what I'm talking about (my mom was really fortunate growing up, and my therapist had never even heard of imposter syndrome).

5,Jam3sConn3r,1578774830,/r/college/comments/enctwm/a_reminder_to_say_thank_you/,"My father is a good man. He is the best man I know, and I am immeasurably lucky to have had him guide me to where I am now in life, which is a freshman at a great university. He also went to college. He worked two jobs to pay for it himself while maintaining a good enough GPA to apply to law school, in which he also worked multiple jobs. I don't work while at school, but I do 40 hours a week in the summers. My father grew up poor. Really poor. Hispanic kid in 60s California and Illinois trying to make ends meet poor. 11 siblings that all ate the same thing every day and didn't complain because they knew how hard their parents worked to put food on the table poor. I grew up asking for ten bucks to drive through Culver's with my friends. I grew up asking for something else if the dinner he made me wasn't what I wanted. My dad worked from 6 am to 8 pm picking cucumbers in 80-degree heat when he started middle school. I got my own laptop when I started sixth grade. My dad works long days, sometimes six days a week, at his office and has prosecuted more cases than most of his coworkers combined over his career. I go to frat parties and get so drunk that I have to go the hospital. I woke up this morning in the ER with an IV winding its way down my arm and my clothes in a bag behind the bed I was in. I loathe myself. My father brought me up strong, showed by example what a man should be, raised up good men in my eyes, and talked about his love for God so strongly that when I was young that I wanted to be a priest. Sometimes, when the world seems very quiet to me, I like to take a moment to remember the stories he'd tell me of the amazing people he has been blessed to work with over the years. He would talk of the judge, an old Irish catholic from Boston with a presence bigger than the room. How he would talk, and everyone would listen, hanging on each syllable, even the men standing before him accused of murder or violent sex trafficking or drug running, they all stood before him enrobed in the thoughtful cadence of his voice as he doled out wisdom from his seat. He talked of things like justice, yes, every judge should, but he also talked of compassion, of thoughtfulness, of honor, of strength of character and mental fortitude. He sat on the bench as a judge, but he stood before the room as a man, a model of what one should strive to be. He loved his wife dearly for over forty years and always took the time to shake your hand, look you clearly in the eye,  address you as sir, and ask you how you were, even the young men who came before him accused of heinous acts received the same solemn dignity that I did when I came in to watch my father work on warm summer days when my daycare wasn't open. He died last year. Pancreatic cancer. He fought it till the end, but the end was bitter. I won't soon forget how my father cried for this man. All my father said to me when he got back from the funeral was, ""He was a good catholic, but a better man."" My father worked many cases that this judge presided over and they were good friends in private, he was almost a second father to my old man. My dad's real father died when I was in third grade. Alzheimer's. I had never met him. My father's side of the family lived in Texas and for some reason we had never visited. That was the first time I saw my father cry. It broke me. He spoke at the funeral, between quiet, reserved moments of thought. That was the first time I had ever truly paid attention when my dad told stories about growing up. He talked about his father's life. Making a living during the depression, fighting in the second world war, raising 11 children on a car factory worker's salary. Teaching his children the value of their faith and each other. Never letting them forget the value of a dollar or a dream. Showing the resourcefulness of an eighth-grade education and the passion of an immigrant with a belief in the ideals of America. I could tell from the way the room was packed that this man was more than just a father. That was what I thought then, but remembering my old man speaking through teary eyes before his family, I now realize the man laying in the casket before him was exactly that: a father. He was the very best thing a boy could have. A father, a giant, a pair of calloused hands tucking you into bed after they worked a 14-hour shift placing the door on new model Chryslers they could never afford. A man who smacks you across your ear when you talk to loud in church and a man who picks you back up after you fall trying to learn to ride the secondhand bike he saved up for 3 months to get you. The sort of man you spend your whole life trying to grow up into, but always feel like you're coming up just short. The sort of man I hope someday my kids might be able to look to, and the sort of man my father is to me. But I let that man down yesterday and the shame and guilt are almost more than I can bear. But they were also a choice I made, and my father raised me up to own the choices I make. Laying on that bed in the middle of the ER I felt like dying. Not from the alcohol or from the embarrassment of the bad choices I made suddenly flooding to the front of my mind as I started to remember the previous night, not even from the thought of the bill that was inevitably coming in the mail. Those were all my choice and things that I could and will own. No, I dreaded more than anything the thought of telling my father, the man whose eyes filled with tears dropping me off at one of the best universities in the world because I now had ""the opportunities he never did"" and who was so proud to be able to pay for my tuition that he had saved for so that I ""wouldn't have to work the same crumby night shifts at the CVS"" like he did. How could I do this to my old man, who had given up so much for me. The same man who stayed up late hours to help me with my math homework after work so that I could get into that summer program. The same man who never missed a single one of my stupid tennis matches and coached every basketball team I was ever on. The same man who quietly drove me home after bad losses because he knew the music just made me angrier. The same man who spent what felt like years teaching me how to cast a rod only to see me give up after I got no bites in the first fifteen minutes. He is a colossus and I spent my childhood living in his loving shade. Now as I stare at the yellow patient ID bracelet on my hand, part of me can't help but smile. Not because I'm proud of what I did, there is no redeemable aspect of my actions and this I know. I smile because I know just how much my father loves me, and just how much I love him. I began writing this because I didn't have an outlet to put my emotions, a thousand miles from my home. I thought I understood how I felt and that the phrase ""I want to die"" pretty much encapsulated it. Now, more than anything, I want to live. To live to be the man my father wants me to be, to be the type of man I want to be. I'm still racked with conflict in my mind: sadness, regret, self-pity, disgust, and anger are all swirling through my thoughts. I'm still terribly afraid of the disappointment I know my father will feel. But I am strengthened by knowing I am my father's son. His love has always been my armor in this world, and it has enabled me to do great things. As I leave the world he prepared for me and start my life outside of his influence I am comforted by the knowledge that he raised me with every ounce of effort, courage, compassion, and conviction that he had, and, that while I will inevitably make mistakes, including many bad ones like last night, I have what I need to pick myself up, dust off my shoes, adjust the saddle and get back on the horse. No matter how many times it throws me. Now, I don't know if I will ever find the time or courage to show my father this, but I hope after you read this you can take some time to reflect on how much someone in your life has given you. Take the time to appreciate the small things they may do for you every day or the things they do for you without knowing it themselves. I hope you read this and feel like maybe you too can stand on the shoulders of giants like my dad, or your dad, or your mom, or your older brother, best friend, neighbor or cousin. We all have giants in our lives who raise us up to more than we thought we could be. Finding yours is important, but maybe more important is standing tall for others and making room on your shoulders for someone else's giant. So, if anyone needs a 5'8"" giant, I'll be studying for my calc final and trying my best to stand tall in the library basement.

Since the start of 2nd semester I have not been feeling motivated at all to do anything besides getting decent grades (haven't even done a great job at that -- GPA currently sitting at a 3.57). Got a phucking C+ in Advanced E&amp;M. In Feb. I was kicked out of my uni's Undergraduate Science Journal for many absences and not giving a shit during meetings. Have been kicked out of 2 research labs during the academic year for not showing up/being competent, and I completely ghosted my 3rd one, where I was supposed to be researching this summer. Parents are under the impression that I am doing research at the 2nd lab at this moment. I have no motivation at all to do research or even clinical volunteering/shadowing -- haven't felt any type of urge to reach out to anyone for opportunities. The only productive thing I have been doing this summer is taking 1 class (intro stats), required for pre-med. Sleeping at 5am and waking up at 2pm on a daily basis. 

Before and after my 1 1/2 hour class from Mon. - Thurs., and during the weekend, I do nothing but waste time. The usual suspects: YouTube, IG, Snap, Facebook, Pornhub, etc. I deactivated my IG in late June but reactivated it a week later -- I have no self-discipline. I have not done any type of exercise in over 2 months, unless you count jacking off, which I do 5-6 times a day. I have stopped responding to emails. I don't even know what courses I am taking next semester.

Parents know I made no friends at all in first year -- in fact, I pretty much scowled or frowned at everyone who I came into contact with; never made an effort to talk to anyone. I have not changed this attitude during summer, actively avoiding anyone in my dorm and expressing disgust when I run into someone in elevators/bathrooms/lobby. When my younger brother visited me for a day and we were going to my room, I loudly yelled, ""Everyone here is a fucking sack of shit."" As you can tell, I despise everyone and everything here. Every day I think about how much I absolutely hate it here and how many days are left until my flight home. I even wear the apparel of other colleges, which my parents aren't particularly fond of. My dad made me see a shrink, and that old twat (the shrink, not dad) did not understand any of my thoughts or help in the slightest. 

I wouldn't say I'm just depressed; although I manifest all the typical symptoms of depression, since college started, a deep-rooted anger at everything and everyone around me (except my family and high school friends) has been growing, and I can't get rid of it. A major part of it is because I was hoping to get into a top-tier school and failed, leaving me in a pit of immense frustration and disappointment. I have tried to get over it for a year, to no avail at all. In fact, I feel much worse about it now than I did going into my first year.

**In a nutshell,** my academic, social, and mental life has been going down the shithole since starting school, and I have made up my mind that the next 3 years will be just as piss-poor. I believe the root cause is a tremendous bitterness over not getting into a better school -- this feeling has only grown over time. This summer,  I have been unproductive, lazy, and unmotivated beyond words. Since college started, I have achieved 0 of the goals I set for myself before leaving home. I have made an active decision not to make any friends for my entire college career just to spite everyone and everything associated with this school. No matter what my parents tell me, I refuse to follow their advice and change my ways.

7,bin8827,1527978560,/r/college/comments/8o44sp/what_is_your_opinion_on_my_plan_i_want_to_hear/,"This is a writing I already posted at College Confidential. I'm sorry if it makes you bother.

 Before the body, I'm sorry for my poor English.  


I'm a south korean, male, 21. I finished my mandatory duty a few month ago. So I has been idle now.  
There was a college I attended, But recently I dropped out of this school for some reason. I really didn't like that school, so I only finished one semester of freshman before being drafted.  


Lately, I got a new dream: studying in the US and eventually emigrating to US. However, as you know, US college is expensive and it's hard to afford; my family isn't wealthy. Moreover, I don't have anything to apply: SAT/ACT score, mediocre GPA \(my mental problem and korean secondary education is oriented final college exam\), mediocre English ability \(perhaps influential to write an essay\) and decisively I don't have any good EC and strong relationship to get a recommendation letter.  


Thus entering as a freshman in the US college is impossible for me. so I decide to set plan like this:  
1. Taking korean college exam to attend korean university.  
2. During my korean college life, Growing myself as far as I can. \(Getting a perfect GPA from tough/core course and recommendation letter, Writing strong Essay, Building many good EC\)  
3. Applying to university as a transfer applicant.  


Of course, I know that universities whose need\-blind policy for international student are Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT.  
I'm going to apply these schools and also know that these schools are very very competitive. Transfer application as an asian\-international is even more competitive.  


But I personally think that chance for me to upcoming decision is literally zero. My plan seems rare and unlikely, but not zero, I guess.  


If my plan would fail, I'd consider to enter PhD program in the US with funding. My goal is to be a researcher on economy or cs. So even if I'd get failure, I believe I can endure it.

8,TheFancrafter,1508435630,/r/college/comments/77g4vh/depressed_college_dropout_millennial_645789_wants/,"TLDR; dropped out of computer science 3-4 years ago, 25 now, soul searched, found medication for my mental illnesses and want to write, either creatively or in games journalism, but I’d write anywhere that scratches the same itch. That being said, I also hate my job, and want out of it fast, and the thought of going back for a more practical degree that will get me a higher paying job that will bore me but leave me more secure is both tempting and scary. I am building a portfolio regardless of pay in my free time. Outside of that, I have had a ton of trouble finding writing jobs, freelance or otherwise. 

Are there just not a lot of jobs relating to creative writing out there/the market is too saturated?

Do you think my passion for either English or Journalism is worth going back to school for, despite starting as a comp sci major? Or should I do those on the side and go for something else?

Do you feel like there are other careers that are more practical careers that would “scratch the itch” of writing?

Any additional advice? 

More about me below if you care:

I’m a college dropout.  A one two punch of mental illnesses and not being good at the major (computer science) killed it for me.Thankfully (or unfortunately for my poor, loving parents) they paid for it, so no debt. I dropped out, found the right combo of meds and psychiatry, worked retail for two years, then worked my way around to a recruiting job that pays me enough to be self sufficient and gives me healthcare, but not much else. I also hate it, the exception being when I was writing a guide for new hires on my own (as I felt the training they got was inadequate).

I did a lot of soul searching after dropping out and realized I wanted to do something creative relating to writing. Well, I always knew, but couldn’t accept it, because I always felt the pressure to be the money maker for a nuclear family I didn’t even want. I could never see a creative field giving me that. Also growing up, I had this sort of battle between my more analytical side and creative side, and felt a career purely in writing wouldn’t satisfy me in that way. While I am also a very analytical person, I am not as much so as my former peers in computer science, and in different ways. I was always someone that like thinking about hypothetical cool characters, stories, ideas, or criticisms of movies or games, and never took a lot of the more “practical” things everyone else did seriously, placing more importance on nitpicking art to the bone by myself.

I recently started writing game reviews at a very small gaming site. They don’t pay me, but they do buy me the games, give me an “official” portfolio of online published work, and are all stand up people. Before that (and still currently) I have been writing on my own and not publishing anything in a sort of unique style of content. though I have a blog set up for when I decide any of it is worth publishing. My dream job would be writing/designing games, or my blog taking off, or some type of gaming journalism/reviewing. I don’t want kids and don’t need a lot of money if my hobbies (writing and gaming) come with the job. Honestly I just like writing (and write better when not stream of consciousness typing on my iPhone at work). But I’m a bit lost on how to approach going back to college (if I should at all) after these years, what I should major in, etc. Questions are above.

9,Valronbalron,1504752554,/r/college/comments/6yki0u/im_such_a_loser_what_do_i_do/,"College Freshman girl here- I've only been at the school for a few days but already my peers are making friend groups and my roommate is regularly going out to party (like, at exclusive parties. Everybody knows here already) Not only am I a huge nerd, (I wear glasses, I love my classes, I'm super awkward around new people) I'm also struggling a lot financially. 

I chose to go to a small private university because they offered me the most amount of aid. I come from a really poor family. My parents are high school drop outs and my dad sold pot growing up and my mom is still trying to get her nursing degree. Even with all the financial aid I got, It's still costing me 8k to go here a year. I got a 4k scholarship this year so I only had to make 2k and I got the other 2k from my grandma (who isn't wealthy by any means either). 

As a result, I feel like a complete outsider. Most of the other girls here are bleach blonde, obsessed with partying, and pretty snobby towards me. The guys are all sporty too. I don't want to be the loser I was in high school, always working part time jobs and working my ass off to get good grades. I want to socialize and I've heard that connections are the most important thing you can get out of college. I'm into parties and drinking I guess... but in moderation. 
What do I do? How important is socializing really in college? ",college,I'm such a loser. What do I do?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/6yki0u/im_such_a_loser_what_do_i_do/,1504770554.0
10,Successbro,1457562185,/r/college/comments/49qipf/swirling_confusion_all_day_every_day/,"Well, here we go, I'm bored and have nothing else to do so I'm going to make a new post on my experience I've been having at college. Well to start, I go to a public university. 10,000 students. No biggie. And the whole journey has been somewhat stale. I got here, went to various orientation events, and got started on my way to studying.

I've never been a social guy. I figured I'd try it out. Bad idea. I'm realizing just how shallow and selfish people really are. So many two-faced characters it's disgusting to me. Nice one moment. Coldly prejudiced the next. I still don't get people. I am starting to think I never will. One big fucking popularity contest. It's all about style. Wear the same clothes as everyone else and you'll do fine. Watch the same things. Say the same things. Do the same things. No true originality there, just hopping on someone else's wave and riding alongside the doomed masses. 

Isolation. I spend a very long time just working, studying, and occasionally going out with some other human beings. But it's never satisfying. I'm still confused as to what socializing is and the parts I understand I don't care to fit into. Rinse and repeat. I really am not sure what the meaning of life is anymore or what purpose my career really has.

It's all just going through the motions. 

Then, here in America, with politics I see the same thing as in college. Big fucking popularity contest. No one actually cares what these guys are saying. It's all Hillary this, Trump that, Republican pricks, Liberal socialists. Is anybody actually thinking about where the future of this country is going? Like we are all going to have to live with all the decisions made. 

Meh. It's all messed up. Economy. Greed. Poverty. Greedy poor. Like people complaining about being poor, get the fuck over it. We're not starving. We're not living without clean water sources. We're all just a bunch of bottle-fed babies growing up and I'm realizing yes I'm one of them. I hate it all. I hate this country. I hate the people here. I hate my family. I hate the people at my college. I hate the people at my church. I guess I even hate myself for being so unable to take care of things properly. Who knows what the hecks going on?

If there were even one person on the planet that I don't really hate, let me know and I'll be glad to meet this person. FML.",college,"Swirling confusion, all day, every day",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/49qipf/swirling_confusion_all_day_every_day/,1457580185.0
