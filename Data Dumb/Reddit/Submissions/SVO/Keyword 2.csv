2,xominion,1666153038,/r/college/comments/y7sk0w/should_i_try_to_transfer/,"I dropped a class last year due to the writing requirements. I spent countless hours trying to research my topic only to not be able to understand any of the academic sources I was finding. I dropped the class because I didn't have anything written by the time the paper was due.

I'm retaking the course this semester since it's required for my degree, and I'm running into the exact same issue. I've spent countless hours trying to work on this shit. Again, the sources I'm finding are either (a) long as shit, (b) built on a foundation of industry-related knowledge I shouldn't be expected to know, or (c) have ridiculous amounts of complicated maths that I shouldn't be expected to know either.

At this point I know I'm not going to have a paper due in two days. It's a pass/fail situation. You need to pass the writing portion of the class to pass the class overall. I've already accepted that I'm going to fail at this point. I have a 4.0 GPA that will tank because of this, but hopefully it won't affect my chances of transferring to an online school like the University of Phoenix. Ideally I'd like to go to a technical college where I can focus on actual shit related to what I want to do (software development). But if I can't transfer, then I'm not sure if I should just drop out seeing how this class is required for my degree. It sucks that I came this far in my undergrad CS degree only to be stumped by a fucking term paper, but I have no idea what to do at this point. I guess I'm just not smart enough for this shit.

I didn't email any of my professors letting them know why, and just left it at that. 

Today, I got a missed call from one of my professors and he left me a message saying how great of a student I am and that I should come back to class, and when I called him back, he told me he'd help me get enrolled again and that it isn't final yet. So, we talked for a bit on the phone and I told him I did regret dropping out but I'm unsure of the penalties I'd face and how easy it was to come back. Again, he said he'd help me. He told me I'm an awesome student and person, and I guess that's why he wants to help me? Idk. None of my other professors reached out to me about this. 

He then called admissions for me and they told him I could come back, with the professors permission, which I already have from him for his class. I told him I'd like to email one of my other professors and see if I could join her class tonight and he emailed her for me. She said she'd love for me to come back and when I went to class, I talked to her for a bit in the hallway and she even gave me a hug. That was sweet and I almost teared up cause I'm an emotional person lol.

6,Impressive_Ad7185,1666060294,/r/college/comments/y6uatr/how_do_i_balance_college/,"I'll keep it short and sweet.

I'm a current freshman who is actively involved in six to seven extra-curricular activities, dedicating about 15-20 hours a week to them, if not more. I was originally taking seven classes, or eighteen credits, but the class proved to be too difficult, in which I dropped it and plan to retake it over the summer. Now I'm taking fifteen credits, which is still considered to be a full-time student.

 I also dedicate my time to actively seeking out and applying to scholarships, job &amp; internship opportunities, and attending workshops to increase my knowledge about potential tech companies that may hire me over the summer. And lastly, I am at the beginning of becoming involved in a sport, specifically volleyball, which may (or may not) be taking up the majority of my time in the evenings.

Did I mention I participate in Fitness Friday's at the gym and do glow in the dark cycling AND yoga?!  ;D

On a serious note, I'm panicking. Not like anyone cares. Everyone always replies with ""I'm struggling too, babe"" or ""Yeah, I feel you"". 

I feel as though I'm taking on a lot and I need to take a step back, but I just can't because I'm so focused and set on achieving the goals I have in my mind. They're these goals that are blaring in my mind, and I'd consider myself an absolute failure if I didn't achieve them. And at times, I want to cry because I'm beating myself down, but I need to keep going. 

I come from a low income family, my mother works part-time. My father is currently not involved in my life. I also come from a toxic at-home living situation, and this is the first time I've gotten a real taste of freedom and involvement. In high school, my grades sucked kinda (graduated with a 3.5), and if it weren't for my living situation I could've done better. I could've been more involved.

Now, my life is in my hands. I just turned 18 and I feel that I need to step up to the plate. I've mapped out my whole life before I came here:

I'll get a job, participate in extra curriculars, get a 4.0 gpa. I'll declare either my minor or my dual degree. I will also work internships over the summer. Then I'll transfer to my dream school and join the accelerated masters program in which I'll attain my true education. And when I graduate, I'll become either a Financial Tech Advisor or a Data Analyst. I will then be able to provide for my mother and buy a comfy condo (which I've already picked out) on the beach. This said beach is aslo where I'll meet my husband.

I'm just stressed though. How do people do this for four years? Each day, its go, go go. I never get to rest. And I hardly sleep, geez. I'm stuck in the library until 2am most of the time, and even then, I'm still doing work.

I think I work hard, but some weeks I just have like...very little work, and it makes me feel horrible. 

Last week was a super stressful week, exams, papers, homework, work work, but this week many of my classes are canceled by coincidence (ie. a once a week class met twice, so we're balancing it out, etc.) and my workload has simply dropped. I feel so out of place whenever this happens, like I don't actually work hard enough or do enough because I have a few free nights (I have basically nothing on Wednesday or Friday). I feel ashamed and like I have to hide this secret that I don't work hard enough, even though I know I do enough - I'm taking 17 credits, taking high-level classes, in a few clubs, work part time, but it never feels like enough, and weirdly it's not like I'm drowning, which again makes me feel ashamed. I know it must sound insane for me to be complaining about an easy week or a few easy days or even just some free time, but I feel like I have to hide it like some big secret. It's a constant feeling of shame that never goes away and it's eating away at my life. It's neverending anxiety about not feeling good enough or smart enough because I have _any_ free time. Constant shame that then turns to anger and anxiety, it's seriously destroying me.

8,__notElonMusk__,1666021048,/r/college/comments/y6e9on/my_untreated_add_is_kicking_my_ass/,"I'm a senior in college (female, 22). I'm a senior right now because I'm currently on track. However, to get to where I'm at I have failed at least three going on four classes now. My degree is Fashion Merchandising and most classes are very strict about only being offered in the Fall or Spring. If you fail a class you have to wait until the next year of Fall. Since I have failed Three classes my date for my graduation has been pushed back. Today I walked into class and realized I had forgotten about an exam and also never received the paperwork for it. 

My professor who I have had for four years looked so disappointed in me and I was DEVASTATED. 

I usually try to put all on due dates on my Google calendar since I'm always on my phone it's a good reminder. 

Lately I have been dealing with money issues, my boyfriend and I lost our jobs around the same time and have been struggling to pick things back up for a couple of months. We had to borrow money from our parents for the first time ever and it was heartbreaking for me. My parents were very much against me moving out and I have been wanting to prove I can do it by myself and have done so for two years now. This week we finally got a break and found jobs for ourselves. I'm very proud of us since we both struggle with ADD. We have both been unmedicated for a long time and we do our very best at getting things done. 

I am currently crying in a hallway at school because of how angry I am at myself for messing up and failing a class for the FOURTH time now. 
I haven't failed it yet but now that I have missed that class, I would have to make perfect scores on everything else for the semester to even get a C-. I have tried doing that in the past classes I have failed and it is so hard to get perfect scores when I'm absolutely horrible at studying and math. My parents don't even know how many times I've failed already since they have their own issues to deal with. 

I am so scared because I've been telling everyone I'm a Senior now but if I don't pass this Fashion Ops class (it has a fashion Ops 2 class after it) 

I'll be here for another year. A year I can't financially afford or mentally take. 

My professors have become very concerned and have recommended I see counseling and financial help. I was recommended to the Disability center but since my parents lost my paperwork for my ADD I'll most likely have to prove I got it again. I'm very scared to ask for help as I have grown up with my parents saying my ADD is just an excuse and they were never really educated on it as they are now. 

I used to take medicine for my ADD from elementary to middle school but since it made me feel like such a robot my parents took me off of it. The medicine according to my classmates and parents would take my whole personality away, I went from a very hyper kid that was distracted so much to a silent robot that would freak my teachers out after they had complained about how much of a distraction I was. 

I could really use some advice or even people who struggle the same. My boyfriend is the only other ADD person I know of in my life. He can relate to me to an extent but no longer attends college as he dropped out his freshmen year. I feel incredibly stupid as I see my classmates in college do so well and get 90s and 100s. I struggle to get Bs in class and usually pass with Cs.",college,My Untreated ADD is kicking my ass,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/y6e9on/my_untreated_add_is_kicking_my_ass/,1666039048.0

I was considering dropping History down to a minor, because I'm worried it's a waste of time. I don't plan on doing history as a career, and as a degree it's definitely not as strong as a double major in a more quantitative subject. My current plan is to go into marketing, or another area of business. I don't have a strong passion for marketing but I have done well. However, I'm torn because I've received so many benefits from doing History with my business degree. 

**Pros of my double major:**

* I did a historical research fellowship this summer for $5,000 (summer before junior year)
* I have a part-time history job during the school year thanks to my experience
* I received scholarship money from my history grades
* I can do both majors and graduate on time. 
* My academic advisor (business) thinks it's an interesting combination and so it makes me ""stand out""
* It boosted my GPA; my history gpa is a 3.9 but my overall is just a 3.5. 
* I enjoy history 

**Cons:** 

* If I keep the major, I can't minor in another field of business. I don't really *want* to minor in another field (options would be data analytics, accounting, or finance). I'm not mathematically inclined so I don't want to risk my GPA for a data analytics minor, which is really difficult at my school. 

Also, if I dropped down to a history minor, I don't know if I would need to repay the scholarship $$ I received (it was reserved for history majors).

19,UseProfessional8450,1665251634,/r/college/comments/xyz1y5/never_taken_english_101/,"I am a college senior this year and I was planning on graduating next year- there's just one problem. In my freshman year of college, I took signed up for a bunch of classes that I ended up dropping to do family issues. English 101 was one of them. I tried retaking the class the next semester, but ended up not really liking the professor, so I dropped it yet again. That summer, I signed up for another English class and a Chinese 101 class. The Chinese class turned out to be an intensive summer program where we covered CHIN 101 &amp;102 in 6 weeks, so I ended up dropping the English class a third due to lack of time to work on the assignments. Mind you, this was before I knew you could only attempt a class three times. The semester afterwards, I was somehow able to get into ENGL102, and the following semester ENGL 201, despite having never completed English 101. Now as a senior, English is obviously one of the requirements to graduate, so I contacted my school's Dean of Students to get a fourth appeal. She granted me a four attempt, stressing how rare that was,  and registered me in the class the Friday right at end of our school's add/drop period. The following Monday, I had stayed up too late the night before studying, and had an migraine, so I missed the class. Unfortunately, I never contacted my professor to let her know why I had missed it. On Wednesday, I came to class around four minutes late because I couldn't find the classroom, but did not talk with my professor afterwards to make sure I had been counted for attendance. The class was only on Monday and Wednesday, and so that weekend, I caught up on the assignments from the first week of class that I had missed, and then the following Monday when I went to check our assignment schedule, I saw I had been dropped. I checked my transcript, and it was yet again a W. As I said earlier, I have every other credit that I need to graduate, except for this English class, and I'm pretty sure that I can't graduate now that I wasted my fourth attempt; I just didn't expect to be dropped without warning. My school has an attendance policy of not missing more than six class sessions per semester, and if we count the first week where I had not yet registered as absences, then I had at most four absences, but maybe there was an attendance quiz I had missed which led to me being dropped? At any rate, it looks like I won't be able to graduate anymore,  so I really just want to jump off a bridge. I've always pushed myself to get good grades in college (I've got a 3.81 bc online chem -\_-), but not being able to graduate because of ENGL 101 makes me want to smash my head into a wall.

21,currentlysylveon,1665186156,/r/college/comments/xydrqc/advice_for_a_newb/,"Good day, thank you for taking your time to read this. I am a twenty-three year old female that dropped out of high-school during my sophomore year. I was very lazy, unmotivated, and had parents that didn't really care or encourage me. I do not blame them, however, as I fully made the decision to drop out because I wanted to play on my phone all day, everyday. I have been working since I was sixteen and now, at twenty-three, have a full-time job as a manager in a grocery store. My department is a specialty department, henceforth meaning if someone calls out, I have to come in. I am also married, have a child, and a plethora of bills where I am unable to change or depart my job. It works out financially, but every week - especially with the way the economy is - I am always under or scraping by at bare minimum.

I got my GED in 2020 and ever since, I have been thinking of college. What I want to do, where I want to go, how I can afford it, how I can balance it with my demanding job. I have decided yet again to look into college, wishing to pursue nursing. I have grappled with this decision for the last year. I know what it takes. I know the sacrifice. I know the difficulty. My mom works for the hospital, my grandmother, my aunts (x3), my sister, my friends. I am also quite smart. I can't toot my own horn, but I am capable of the work. I simply need to dedicate myself, which if money is on the line, I know I can do.

I have many questions. I find it difficult thanks to Covid to get any insight in college. Most people won't meet in person and I need to see someone to understand what they're explaining, so whilst I'm not seeing any of you, I'm hoping someone can help me figure out, basically, how this all works?

First of all; I do not have any money. No savings, nothing. My spouse and I work in the same grocery store and make barely enough to pay our bills. Nothing more. Will student loans/FAFSA/etc pay for it all? And then I just have to pay it back, like a credit card bill?

Second of all; how does it . . . work? Do I pick classes and then just go to classes and pass them? How do I know I'm taking the right classes towards my degree?

Third of all; how do I fit it into my schedule? Night school, sure, but I am worried if I have to miss school for my job, because we go through highs and lows of employees. I've had to cancel many things in the past, but I don't wish for my education to suffer.

And then, simply, anything else you can share. Please Reddit, whatever you can throw at me. I'm all ears - I just want to better my life and the lives of my family.",college,Advice for a newb...,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/xydrqc/advice_for_a_newb/,1665204156.0

I (17M) graduated from highschool in June. I enrolled in a Computer Science program and I dropped out as I hated it. I just had no interest and being straight out of highschool, I just didn’t think I was ready to go to college just yet after finishing school. 

I’ve been thinking lately that I would like to do a poli sci degree. Politics interest me and I think I could actually go to school to study it and be interested and learn actually valuable skills. Politics really interest me and I enjoy writing and researching. But I’m hesitant because I know it’s a hard degree to get an actual job with (well, it seems). And I’m not sure if I want a office job for the rest of my life. I currently work as an administrative assistant and I dislike it. I feel like I’m always trying to find things to do to keep me busy and the director of the department is so controlling and wants to know EVERYTHING which makes my supervisor who’s generally really nice, up my ass all the time. There is also one part of the job I really hate that is really making me want to quit. But, I’m pushing through. Though this might be a bad representation of what my job with a poli sci degree would be like. 

If anyone has any advice on doing a poli sci degree, that would be great. Law, politics, economics, human history, sociology, are all things that interest me quite a lot.

I don't post on reddit really at all so I apologize if this is in the wrong place. I really i am just on here to look up questions that I need answered. but i am in dire need of others opinions/advice right now. So, here's the situation. Sorry it's so long!

I am 20, i live in the deep south (United States) and am in my 4th year of my undergraduate degree in Sociology. I have a minor in Gender Studies completed and am working toward a second minor in Social Justice and am co-founder &amp; president of a student org. at my school. I love my major (though it is so depressing sometimes). And I used to really enjoy school. I like a routine. I don't know what changed but I can't wake up and get to class anymore without feeling an immense sense of panic and dread. Just absolute dread. I even really enjoy some of my classes and my professors. I had a really tough time in 2019 during my first year of college but after the first few months I got into the swing of things and made friends and joined clubs and attended events and everything that freshmen in college are expected or assumed to do. I went to some parties, I got really good grades. The pandemic hit though and then I failed an online class that summer, changed majors the next year, then changed majors again, and then finally again (when I landed on Sociology). That same year I was diagnosed with ADHD. 

Fast forward, my junior year was fine. We were back in person (thank god) and while I didn't necessarily enjoy going to school, I loved the people I was surrounded with. I still love the people I'm around deeply. I thought about transferring a lot that year and even applied and got into another program at another school. I decided against transferring for reasons that aren't important enough to get into. 

This year during the spring semester of my junior year, my grandfather was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. He passed away in June and a week later I was sitting in my July classes. They were fine and I managed to finish all three classes with As (and one 89 but I'm counting it as an A. Close enough IMO). Two weeks after they ended I started the semester I am currently in: fall semester of my senior year. I have a GPA of 3.3 and I am .1 away from graduating Cum Laude. I am a few classes behind so I will be here an extra summer or fall semester next year (I'm supposed to graduate in May 2023). I'm not doing bad at all. But I cannot for the life of me get shit done. I've always had a thing about skipping class but this semester its been way harder to go than usual. I've missed a couple of assignments but nothing major. I have Bs and an A and I dropped the one class I absolutely hated, even though I need it to graduate, thinking it would make me feel better and do better in my other classes that I don't hate. But it didn't and so now I am another credit behind and I still am struggling to get to class and do work. 

I have no idea what I am going to do after college and my job projections for this major really aren't all that great. I wanted to go to graduate school originally but now I don't know about that either because I'm not sure I even want to finish my undergrad degree. 

I feel like I am absolutely suffocating and I am full of dread regarding school. My grandfather really cared about my education (and so does the rest of my family). I feel like such a disappointment to them all but I know this is my life, not theirs, and I have to make choices that will benefit me in the long run. 

If anyone can give me any advice I am begging for it. I have no work experience outside of waitressing, secretarial, and retail (I enjoy the hell out of waitressing but getting paid $2.13/hr is ridiculous and no one here tips worth a shit). Currently unemployed to focus on school. Thanks so much if you read this far, super appreciated. Couldn't just sit and write this in my journal anymore.

I am 23 years old as of this month (Sept 2022)

I still live with my mom. She makes around $100k/year. My dad makes around $350k/year.

Basically they do not want to help pay for my college unless I go to a local community college near me and I stay living with my mom.

TMI: I really don’t get any sort of emotional support from them. They think I feel entitled for them to pay for my college, but I do not want them to pay if they do not actively WANT to pay. And it doesn’t seem like they do. I do not want to feel like I am forcing them. I would rather go into student debt than feel like I owe them anything - emotionally or financially. I feel trapped. The reason I still live at home at 23 is because of severe mental health issues. I feel like my mental health will get better if I move away from my family, even if it hurts them.

I dropped out of high school (therefore I have no SAT test scores or anything like that) but I got my GED in 2019. 

As embarrassing as it is, I have no “adult” life skills. I don’t know how to pay taxes, schedule appointments, or do anything like that. I really want to learn though, but I don’t know where to start. I know you can learn basically anything on the internet, but it feels so overwhelming and it is embarrassing how stressful these things are for me.

Also I have extreme anxiety around driving, therefore I do not have my driver’s license. 

At this point I don’t care if I go into debt, I just need to gain some sort of independence. 

My problem is financial aid. Since my parents make so much money, I don’t think I qualify for any real financial help until I am 24 and considered “independent.” 

Would I automatically be considered an independent at 24 years old, even if I were still live at home? (Also: I do not currently have a job.)

My mom does not want me living with her unless I am in school or have a job, so I am planning on getting a job for a year until I am 24, and then applying for college/financial aid. I want to go to art school, so this will also give me time to put together a portfolio.

30,sillybumbleb,1663918036,/r/college/comments/xlqox9/advice_for_game_dev_majors/,"i’m a freshman in UT Austin, enrolled in a program called AET (stands for Arts and Entertainment Technologies), and it’s marketed as very flexible major depending on the career path you want to go on. the classes range from music and sound design to animation to computer science to game development. this all sounded great, because my dream is to be able to make my own indie game, and while i can take classes to help me with that i can also learn programming and how to make soundtracks so i’m not just experienced in animation, and be able to do a lot of things on my own.

i knew that it was a new major and that it began in 2017, so i was prepared for some level of disorganization as i’m sure the professors and admin still needed to figure out the classes. only being 5 weeks in, i can already tell that “disorganized” is a huge understatement when describing AET.

i went to the UT Austin subreddit to ask about the experiences of others in the major, because i was feeling really underwhelmed by my 4th week and so far the only thing they were teaching us was “mindfulness” and “interactivity”, which sounds interesting but then you start to question what this has to do with game design/animation/etc and ask the professors (i have 3 professors in my introduction to AET and 2 in my design class, and then there’s at least 3 TAs in each), and they respond with “it’ll make sense later”, it puts a lot of doubt on the ability of these professors to actually teach you something helpful. at one point they had us bring in household items and then told us to make something out of them, at the end they told us the point of the exercise was to recreate what it was like for us in preschool/elementary school where our minds were more creative.

i'm not trying to say that what they're teaching is bad, i think doing exercises like that is calming, but it's not something i want to be doing in a class i'm paying $1,000+ for, and instead could be learning something that would be useful for our careers.

essentially, the admin and professors have really no idea what they're doing. according to many other posts in the UT Austin subreddit basically exposing the AET experience, every single year it's been like this, no matter what year you're in. and now it seems that admin is pushing all of the classes towards game development and ""interactivity"" (i had to ask some upper classmen in the major what that meant, and apparently now the admin want to add focus to VR and potentially theme parks). this leaves everyone who started the major for the multiple different paths that were advertised that weren't game development being forced into something that won't help them in the future. on the outside, it sounds like that wouldn't affect me and others who are going down that path, but like i said before, even the game dev classes don't have any focus or goal.

i don't want to blame anyone, i'm trying to understand that this is a new major, and that the admin is still figuring out which direction they want it to go in. but it's leaving all of us confused since they can't give us solid reasoning and lesson plans, and end up throwing away a bunch of classes and adding new ones that no one asked for. 

the lack of passion from the professors is really getting to me. seeing them have no idea what they're supposed to be teaching isn't giving me motivation to continue, and it's even started to influence my performance in my other classes because i haven't been able to take any of them seriously. the whole reason i'm at this college is for a major that apparently doesn't have any structure, and if i'm not learning anything from it, it makes me question what's the point of trying to learn from my other classes if i'm not even there for them in the first place?

i kept holding onto hope and looked into game development as a major in general, and apparently it's a scam. a lot of indie game developers (from what i've seen) have warned students of majoring in game dev because of the way it teaches students. to sum up the big reasons: you waste your money to learn half of the whole process in 4 years instead of spending 2 years to learn how to make an entire video game, it doesn't prepare you for the industry at all and ends up leaving fresh graduates overwhelmed when they get into Nintendo or Riot because they learned how to be decent at too many things instead of being really good at a specific skill.

at this point, i was already spiraling, and after learning how the thing i was majoring in barely helps in the career path i want to go in would lead to me being in debt and with no idea what to do, made me withdraw for almost a week (still recovering from it currently), a pattern similar to many times in school.

near the end of high school, i got diagnosed with ADHD and autism because i noticed that i had been doing a lot worse in my classes. my diagnosis helped me realize that teaching myself everything wasn't normal due to the fact that i couldn't pay attention, and in the rare chance that i could i wouldn't understand anything the teacher was saying. people say that learning how to be independent in your studies in a good skill, but for me it's enforced a mindset that school just isn't for me.

a lot of people drop out because it can be very overwhelming to be learning so many things at the same time, it's hard to balance getting the hang of adulthood with a social life, and managing a job, and going to school and having to learn advanced concepts you've never heard of. hearing peoples' stories of this make me feel like i'm having the exact opposite problem where it's actually underwhelming, and i feel like i could be doing something more impactful on my life.

i'm personally doing pretty okay with the problems i've just listed out. i've never had much of a social life, and i'm okay with that because for me, being around too many people is something that is extremely overwhelming for me, and i've had a lot of public meltdowns that i have since learned to avoid by simply being comfortable in my own space and drawing or playing video games. most of my friends i've made from just working at starbucks, and my best friend of all time i met online when i was first starting my art account. i've been working since i was 16, and have experience in customer service because of my time working at barnes &amp; noble and now (as mentioned previously) starbucks, where i'm getting much better pay and a lot of benefits including free therapy. and like i said before, i've been able to earn a decent amount of money from social media by selling my art. i have almost 50k on tiktok, where my niche is that i make tarot decks inspired by my favorite games. my first deck was an Animal Crossing themed one, and i'm currently making a deck for my all time favorite game: Hollow Knight.

My only problem is school. i'm not learning anything from it, and i know it's not me having trouble with the content, it's because of all the problems i just told you about.

I've been able to learn more about how to make a game in Unity from just this past week of watching YouTube tutorials, compared to the 5 weeks i've spent in my actual game development class, where all we've learned about Unity is how to move a circle around and interact with squares.

i know having a degree is important for 90% of careers, but you don't need a degree for game development or animation to get hired by the big companies. the thing that makes you actually stand out is your portfolio. obviously, the best option is a degree and a good portfolio, as it is rare to be hired solely based on the latter, but i'm sure you would have a better chance of being hired based on a well-developed portfolio where it shows that you have a focus, compared to a degree where all you have to show is a general idea of a bunch of different things, but no real skills in something specific.

the best analogy i've heard is that you would rather have just a hammer that's sturdy and well made, than have a hammer from a hardware kit with many other tools that's not as good. sure, that kit has a bunch of things you could use in the future, but you're probably not going to use them, and if you do need a specific piece of hardware, then you'd just go out and buy a well made and sturdy version of that.

but you can basically forget that whole paragraph because i'm not even planning on going into the big industries. when you make an indie game, you don't need to show yourself that you have a degree and know how to draw, because you know that you know how to draw. marketing is more difficult outside of the big companies, but if you already have your own platform that people know, you can still get some amount of attention, all on your own. i know my platform's not very big, but games take a very long time to make and i'm sure that my account can grow by the time a game that i could make is finished.

i think the only reason i haven't dropped out yet is because everyone i've talked to about this, even after explaining my situation, basically says something along the lines of ""dropping out is bad"". and maybe they're right, but right now my gut is telling me that nothing good is going to come out of me staying here.

i should clarify: i don't mean drop out immediately once i'm sure i've gotten a green light. i'm going to stay till the ends of the semester because i already paid, and i feel bad wasting $6k, and also i still have just the smallest amount of hope that something could happen that will change my mind. emphasis on small, because i really don't think it's going to happen.

if you got this far, i appreciate you taking the time out of your day to read this, and i would love to hear your advice because i'm actually freaking out.




way TL;DR: i'm in a really shitty game dev program that i'm thinking of dropping out of because if i graduate from it, will have learned in 4 years maybe half of what i could learn in 2 of teaching myself. i have been able to make money on my own by growing my art platform on social media and working at starbucks. i'm already in the process of making my own game, i've have everything planned out and have been learning the basics of unity from tutorials online. dropping out and being on my own means i'll have more time to work at the cafe and sell my art online to earn an income while i work on my game, all without the crushing fear of debt.


P.S. before you suggest i just switch majors instead of fully dropping out, i've checked and i haven't found any majors that would suit me, but also like i was thinking of before, school probably just isn't for me.

P.S.S. if i do end up dropping out next semester, and later in life come to realize that actually i would like to go back to school, i think that would be better than having the crisis that i'm having right now for the next 4 years and then later in life realizing that i wasted a bunch of money and actually need to figure out what to do with my life or go back to school or something.",college,advice for game dev majors?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/xlqox9/advice_for_game_dev_majors/,1663936036.0

Background: 2021 fall I decided to go to UC Merced for Computer science. Didn't like it and transferred back home to CC for spring 2022. Only half my credits transferred over from Merced which kind of screwed me over to start. Shortly after the start of the spring semester my brother passed away from an overdose and it crumbled me. I couldn't do work and it was to late to drop classes. I also had to put down my own dog(15 years old) a week later. I got COVID a few weeks later which put me into my bed for over 2 weeks without being able to do school and I also missed my brothers funeral because of Covid. My mother at a young age she is, was just diagnosed with cataracts and has less than year before she goes blind and my father told me he wants to kill himself (my parents are separate - never married). All of this has put so much stress on me that my spring and summer classes I took I only got 1 class done out of the 7. I dropped some and others I couldn't drop in time and at the time I didn't care enough ab school to resolve it due to everything going on.   


Now: I am now scrambling for credits to try and see if I can apply to schools for the entry of fall 2023 to be able to go to a university in southern CA (I live in riverside). All of my friends either already go to university's or are going to be next fall. On my current path I'm 3-4 classes behind schedule and my counselors have told me there's a 0% chance I can transfer next fall, which means I would need to wait to go to a university till fall of 2024.   


I emailed all the schools I am interested in to see if they can make any exceptions, or anything I can do to still get in for the fall 2023, but in over a month I never got a response back even phone calls I placed.   
Does anyone know any way I can get in touch easier with college counselors? I can't be at home any longer. 2 more years alone here where all my friends are gone will put me in the grave.  


I'm better mentally now and even completing certificates on the side for Computer Science. I will literally do whatever it takes to get in next fall.  


Any help is appreciated. If im stuck, well then... Guess its all my fault anyways.

Outside of school, I work part time as a surgery tech at a veterinary hospital. This is on Monday and Wednesdays and the shifts are always at least 10 hours, but normally around 12-14 hours. In addition to work, I’m going to start volunteering at the aquarium in the next few weeks. That will just be one 4 hour shift every other week on Saturday, so that’s not too bad but I want to include everything.

This morning I tried to buy my scantrons for an exam and all of my cards got declined even though it only cost 81¢. So this has all been stressing me the fuck out and when I do manage to find the time to study I’m so stressed that it’s all I can think about.

My mom is pressuring me to not drop a class without replacing it with an equal number of credits (it’s too late for that), but I’m seriously drowning in work. I don’t even need to take biochem.

Hello Everyone! I'm a college Freshman and I'm having some trouble with one of my teachers (she teaches communicating effectively which is basically an English/public speaking class). 

First I have some back story. On July 19th of this year (before the school year) I was in a roller skating accident in which my head collided with a wooden fence and then a road sign. To summarize what happened, I had some major road rash and I suffered my first concussion. 

The second incident happened on my first Saturday after classes had already started (August 27th). I was taking a shower, and my blood pressure dropped, and I fainted. Basically, I hit my head twice. The first time I fell I cracked my orbital bone (my eyebrow area) on a concrete ridge (I had to receive 9 stitches for this in the ER). Some time passed, before I got up, and fell backward, landing on my left temple. Some more time passed before I woke up again, and was able to get dressed and get help for myself. This is the second concussion I've had. 

So far I am experiencing light sensitivity, memory loss (amnesia), and regular headaches. I am seeing a Neurologist about these problems and the school has placed me on Concussion protocol, which is supposed to help. 

Now to the point of this: My Comms Professor. A few days after I received my second concussion, I turned in an essay for her. At the time, my right eye was completely swollen shut and I could barely hold a conversation. Needless to say, I misunderstood the prompt and she failed me for the essay but gave me the chance to rewrite it in two days. I did as requested. 

A few days after this, she requested to see me privately after class. She ""Generously gifted"" me a C on my paper and said, ""If your medical condition is going to keep you from writing to my standards, perhaps it is in your best interest that you take a leave of absence for the remainder of the semester"". 

I was absolutely destroyed by this because I'm trying my best given my current circumstances. Even my other Professors seem to think that she was completely out of line by saying that to me. I'm most worried because this teacher has a reputation because she used to be a Nun, and I'm afraid she has preconceived prejudices about me because I dress in Gothic Fashion (I wear all black with dark makeup, and it's not out of place for me to be wearing pentagrams). 

I really need some advice on this because it's already too late for me to drop the course and I already know that this is going to be a huge problem.

My first two years of college was quite unenjoyable and as a result I became depressed. I recently transferred schools to a much more enjoyable college (known for being a party school) and also much more prestigious for my program (Computer Engineering).

However, all I really feel like doing is just socializing because I really missed out on doing that the past two years. I can graduate in 4 semesters if I want to but I want to graduate in 5 and take a couple of blow off classes in between my other really hard classes.

I already have two summers of internships under my belt and I honestly just don't feel like trying much harder in school because I'm confident I'm set. However, something about focusing on socializing and having fun makes me feel bad because I have the potential to double major or minor in something else (I originally wanted to minor in physics but I dropped it because I wanted to socialize more).

I'm years out of high school, but returning to collage to get a certification as an I.T Tech, basically a two semester program. I took one class over the summer which was fine, I did well in it and passed it with a 98. However, this semester my workload is so much ***''I know I'm preaching to the choir''***, since starting this semester I've since learned that my professor this time around (same for all of my classes) is notorious for assigning crazy amounts of homework and having very difficult courses.

I'm not someone who's not used to work, I've held my share of full time jobs since high school graduation including a stint in the oil field working 14 hours a day. But this is crazy, my computer knowledge is basically baseline, I know how to do very basic things, nothing terribly technical but these classes seem like they exist to help refine someone who's already skilled with computers despite being billed as entry level computer courses, the material uses a LOT of technical jargon that almost seems like another language to me and the professor's way of teaching this is basically just if you don't know it, learn it, fly or die essentially.

I'm going through lectures as best I can, but I find that with the time frame I have to work within in order to turn in all my work on time I am not able to fully retain most of the information I'm getting, It feels like the collage just took my money and is now cramming me through this program as fast as they can, and it's not just me, several people have already dropped the program and there's even someone in my classes who mentors with a PC tech for his daily job and even that guy is lost on half of this material.

It's all so fast paced, I don't feel like I'm getting anything out of it. I'm faking my way through tests as best I can by googling information I need, and the virtual labs are often low instruction no demonstration program's which puts me in a position of having to accept grades as low as a 40 at times on those.

I spoke with my professor and explained to him that I was having the issues I was and he encouraged me to keep trying which I have been, but when I asked about hiring a tutor to my dismay he explained that the collage I am attending currently has no tutors that work with this program.

There are also some personal issues that are making this a little harder for me, but I'd rather not dip into those.

Here’s a little context:

I am Dominican, my dad immigrated from the United States when he was really young. 

I am currently in school for a degree in computer science.

I make around 70k a year as a system administrator. 

I am 23 years old.

I am feeling really down. I was super “dumb” in high school. 16 ACT. Barely graduated. But I liked computers. I was going to join the marines but decided to go to school and try it out 

I took a year off school and then went straight to university for computer science. I am a senior and 15 credits away from graduating.

It’s been the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. I’ve had to take classes with 50%+ failure rate. 

I literally started at the lowest math available. Didn’t even count towards my degree. I was learning how to do super basic shit like multiplying something by hand, I shit you not. 

Eventually I pushed through. 

Now I’ve taken: Calculus 1-3, discrete math, algorithm classes, an advanced biology course, stats for scientists and engineers, physics, many others. 

All the while working part time (I work full time now) in IT moving up the ranks. Now I’m a sys admin and am in charge of software and hardware for thousands of users. 

But for my senior year I have something called a capstone project. It’s the last project you have to do. It’s literally impossible. 75% failure rate.

I was supposed to be taking it this fall (it’s in 2 parts) and I absolutely bombed the first part. So I had to drop the class. Now my graduation is set to winter 2023. 

I had so much anxiety about it I dropped another class. Now I’m only taking 4 credits this semester. 

All I’m thinking is how I bombed. “You’re really going to take 5 1/2 years to graduate?” I keep telling myself. I don’t deserve the degree. 

I told my dad I’m not graduating until next winter. He was really disappointed. It’s a big deal because I’ll be the first college educated person in his families entire history. 

“Will I ever finish” I keep telling myself. I’ll be 24 when I finally graduate. 

This all while I’m married and my wife makes a decent income as well (around 60k) and we plan on buying a house next spring and have no student debt or any debt at all. But I still feel so down about myself because of that degree. 

And I don’t want to bring race into this. But I’ve been in practically all predominately white classes my whole school career. Nothing wrong with that. But I was the only brown person in the entire 40 person class I was in for my senior capstone. I really want to graduate to show a little diversity at my school.

The 4th week, I went to class but the class was not in the room I had on my schedule and there wasn't anything posted to tell me where to find and the people who I asked said they didn't know either. I admit that the last absence was my fault since I didn't have the correct location for the class, which I am still unsure how that happened. However, the first two classes that I missed were not my fault at all as i was ordered not to attend and the third was due to a severe disability reaction to the high temps. I guess what trips me up is that if an employer cannot fire me for disability related issues like this then how is it a school can drop me from a class which I found out was actually going to happen after the second class and was not a result of missing this 4th class that I couldn't find. I'm pretty pissed about it especially because they dropped me from another class just 1 day before the term started without any warning or notification and when i emailed to ask I didn't get a response for a week but even then it was ""I can't find your name anywhere"".",college,Can a Professor drop me for missing class due to a disabilty/Covid?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/xewyjg/can_a_professor_drop_me_for_missing_class_due_to/,1663266737.0

I was attending what I thought was a dream college - full scholarship and I felt really excited. Up until that point I felt very proud of who I was and I thought I was secure in how I viewed myself - I genuinely loved school loved getting good grades loved socializing and making new friends. This new school was very different for me though - it was a lot smaller than my high school and I knew no one. I felt out of place and tried to make new friendships and find common interests with different groups.  Nothing felt right - I just felt like I stuck out. Trying to make the most out of “my college experience” by making friends and trying new things I started hanging out with this one this group, studying and hanging out in their dorms after and between classes hoping to get invited to parties. There was one night I decided to stay later at school than I normally do and hang out at the dorms - I remember this one guy showing up and telling me to grab a bottle he brought from his bag. I remember it being one of those twisted bottles (Smirnoff probably) it was already opened and I took a sip. After that I don’t remember anything just bits and pieces like flashes of memories. I remember my body not feeling like me own - as if my limbs were in quick sand I remember being completely naked wrapped in a blanket trying to get to the bathroom throwing up and hugging the toilet - I remember them laughing at me because I had no clothes on and I remember waking up to the sounds of this one girl Mimicking what she heard me yelling out “stop no that hurts, please no that hurts”  and giggling from her top bunk. that morning I woke up with no clue what happened to me or by
Body. All I knew is I didn’t want to be a victim in that moment I didn’t want them to think I wasn’t in control - so I got dressed cried in private and acted like I knew what I was doing that night played it off like I wanted it. I laughed it off and I went to grab food with the whole group….People saw me in a completely vulnerable state and i wanted nothing more than to play it off. From that moment - I was labeled the slut. I was that “one girl who let people watch” there was no escaping the stares the whispers the name Calling.  Everyday on my way to school I’d have a panic attack before class, wipe my face clean and act like nothing was wrong. I started drinking more, smoking more hanging out instead of going to class and giving into whatever label people had given me. If they think I’m a slut then I’m going to be one. I’m doing to flirt with everyone I’m going to be this overly sexualized person - I did this because I felt like this was the only way to feel control over my experience. Eventually my panic attacks became to extreme and I stopped going to class entirely. I didn’t withdraw I didn’t tell my parents - I didn’t tell my friends. I just decided to work full time. I never healed from that I didn’t look at myself the same. I developed an ED I pushed away friendships  and relationships.  There’s so many more layers to this but this is the stuff that plays over and over in my head. Over 12 years later and I feel robbed of my innocence I feel robbed of my hard work and all it took to get accepted to college.

I live with my autistic dad who is emotionally unavailable and only knows how to talk to me like I am in trouble even when I'm not. Surely, a dog would help but dogs are not allowed in my house. I've been in college for 7 years now from age 18 to 25 and I don't even have an associates degree to show for it. I feel like I am forever stuck in purgatory just wandering in a twilight zone where I am always trying to start my next life but never can. I don't live on a campus or near my university. I have to commute an hour to get there. My college is new york city college of technology at nyc. Nobody socializes at my school and it doesn't feel like the university environment encourages socializing. The hallways are dimly lit, nobody looks happy to be there, there's no reason to stay after school and nobody feels like they belong there. I've switched my majors twice, failed some classes and dropped out of other classes. There is a total of 17 classes I've taken that won't count towards my graduation. I feel like I really screwed up college on my first try and I can't go back and re-do it. Truthfully, I wasn't prepared to go to college and wanted a gap year but because my parent's expectations hung over me I went because I figured it was the natural next step. I had poor study habits that I've managed to improve much later. I was depressed when I started college so I didn't have much motivation or confidence going in. I felt like an imposter, like I was pretending to be a student and that I shouldn't be there. I also felt like a failure because I couldn't manage to be accepted by any college besides a community college. I feel like I've already been dogged by life before mine even started. I get emotionally burnt out from any conversation I have with my dad because he only knows how to communicate anger and is tired of me living with him. I am likewise tired of living with this old curmudgeon. 

You get to a point in this situation where you feel like you're going insane, like the world is hostile, people feel unfriendly, you stop being able sleep and you can't get out of your own head.

My personal experience is only a symptom of a much wider societal malaise. This has to be the first time in human history where we are all atomized without any institutions where we can feel seen by each other. I often feel like I don't exist, like I am invisible or a statistic. I don't feel like I belong anywhere. But it's not just me, this is how everyone is feeling nowadays. We're all floating atoms with zero valence. I might as well be living in a post-apocalyptic society but an actual apocalypse might actually inspire some comradery. 

We've taken a mis-step somewhere as a species. How has life come to this where we are all ensconced in our little technologically empowered domes and we've all given up on each other because we don't need anyone. You can't really blame people for wanting to push the power button on life and exit without logging out. Life is literally shit. Everyday I wake up and I can expect more shit from this shit storm.

I am also a little older than the average college sophomore. I just recently turned 24.

I went to a community college in NYC right after graduating high school, but then dropped after the first semester as the major was not in my plans anymore. Now I've been studying computer science on my own and I am certainly sure that's my career of choice.

But I realized how bad my chances are to get into a college with a good computer science program. I messed up my high school, dropped out of a college with only 12 credits, and none of them account towards computer science (animation and motion graphics major.)

So I thought about either going back to college and getting another 12 credits (to increase my chances of at least transferring to a 4 year community college program). But that's also already a far apart thing as the application deadlines are 4 days away and I need to submit a change of major form first, which will take even more to get back to me.

What can the army do for me? I know it can pay for my tuition, but I need to get into a good college first (that community college I was in is free because of how low income my house is) Can I increase my college qualifications in a certain way, like taking CLEP's or a specific program towards computer science?

I don't want to spend a couple years there, get their cyber training and end up stuck working for the army as a cyber security officer.

Anyone familiar with the matter more, please help. I'm basically trying to get my career path together before it's all too far away.

(This might get kinda long) 
Well I’ve finished my first month of college and my god was it something! 

For starters, I went into my dorm building thinking I was going to be staying by myself since the first two roommates switched or dropped from the school. Well, I moved in, had everything settled, and was immediately told that I had to move to the third floor because the AC’s freon was leaking out and wouldn’t be fixed for another week. So I packed up my things and moved from the first floor to the top floor. Turns out the room I moved to had a girl who was in the same situation as me; she came in not expecting a roommate and got me last minute.

At first it was super awkward since we had both packed as if we were living by ourselves. We didn’t talk to each other or the first few hours until later in the evening when I asked if she wanted to go an exhibition match the soccer team was having. We sat for the whole game just talking and getting to know each other. :)

When classes started a few days later, I was terrified for my 8am general chem class, but my fear went for nothing. Turns out, every thing I learned my sophomore year of chemistry is almost copy and paste. Double points for me since I kept all of those notes form highschool. 

I’ve also met a ton of new people and totally fallen in love for the college life. When I came back for Labor Day break, all I could think of was going back. Sure I don’t have a car and my classes can be a bit strenuous at times, but I’m having a blast with it all.

\-Repost-

Hi, I've the title suggest- I haven't been doing so well. Wasn't sure if I'm allowed to post this subreddit or post this in [r/CollegeRant](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/) due to what I'll be saying.

I'll quickly explain a little about myself. I come from a family whose parents are divorced and are heavily toxic which made me introverted. My dad didn't know about this until last week.

I question to myself as to why I'm even going to college, I was accepted to 4 Cal state university but I rejected them all because I was in a bad place near the end of my 12th grade high school time, for context as to how well I did in high school, I graduated with a high 3.5 GPA through my 4 years of high school. I believed going to a community college will help me but in return, my mental health has gotten very low the past year ever since dropping Math Statistics in fall 2021. And then spring, I failed- and now I'm taking it this semester but only realizing that the professor I have now is even worse than I already had before. Looking at the Ratemyprofessor website- having a 3.8 with a high difficulty, this professor wants us to use Microsoft Excel and I question this college- why are they still using Microsoft when more people use Google and are more up to date. Math used to be the subject that was easy for me- Statistics, punched me to the ground until I could barely walk. Statistics really destroyed me the past year and I'm close to the point of giving up. I took Law during the fall but it wasn't for me, the class was very difficult yet I was able to pass with an A, and I thought Law would fit me- then again I am an introvert and how could I even get through it. I took a Kin class called Stress and management- and let me tell you, it was the worst decision of my life. It gave me more stress and the professor was so horrible, didn't even care about my feelings. I Failed at the end. I took History in Spring- withdraw because I needed to add 3 units for 12 units but the classes became very difficult and I don't even know why I even chose the class knowing that history is not my best attribute. Didn't mention English because I mostly score Average- usually C's- I did get a C in Fall with English but had English 67 which I failed because I didn't need help for English, it was a office hour class which During fall- I was told to drop Math 100 for this class which contradicts what I've say. I did take Math 100 and did pass but office hours weren't enough to help me in Spring as mentioned before. During the spring I took English 101. I wasn't told until 1 month later that I needed English 104 to pass 101, since it didn't fit my schedule- I took 101 during the summer and just yesterday as of writing this- I passed with a B, but dear god the summer class was horrible. It was only a 5 week class, nothing wrong until the professor suddenly drops 3 essays both first and final drafts + an in class essay final, in a span of the last two weeks because the third week, she got covid and didn't post any assignments through that week alone until the weekend started. Utter hell I've gone through. So for this fall, I have statistics for the 3rd time, taking computer science (god just the first week, I hate the work because of the website Cengage- a terrible website and the assignments and quizzes are unfair). Before I end this intermission, I took a night class and it's really depressing. I'm more of a morning person since k-12 taught me muscle memory so taking night classes just feels wrong. I understand it works for some people for time sake but it's honestly not my type.

61,Maleficent_Mistake75,1662275622,/r/college/comments/x5gntk/i_got_kicked_out_and_now_struggle_with_school/,"Before hand, big apologies for any grammar mistakes you may find as my first language isn't English.

Hey, I'm freshly 20yr old female and I'm quite struggling  to survive on my own.

Just to make things clear, I was kicked out after my grades dropped during quarantine. The Zoom style of teaching/learning just wasnt working for me. It's not like i didnt try. I did try my best and was taking extra classes to somehow pass through. 

I struggled to pass through an I.T. school from the beginning,  since my parent chose the school for me. At my 15 years, I had no idea what I wanted to do in future, so they thought I will have some use of this. 

However , imo it was a big mistake. I struggled with math since elementary school and it kept on going till high school. Not to mention,  I'm from Czech republic so we have different school system. Preschool from like 3 till 6 years, then elementary school from 6 till 15 and then high school which you pick along with the profession that the school is specifically targeted on.

I survived basically until the 3rd grade (From actually 4 grades) and had to survive just one more year. But yeah. It didnt work out and I had to drop out. I tried and wanted to look for a different school with different profession, but my parents dismissed the thought of me starting from the first year.  Instead, they told me to find a job. Which I did. But after all  , it was nothing what you would want to do for rest of your life. I worked at fastfood restaurant (I think everyone will know this one , it pretty much sells the special Kentucky fried chicken) as I had to be paying rent to my parents , buying my own food etc. 

And boy let me tell you it was hell. You always had to check your hours because almost every month, every salary I got, was missing a part. (I got paid hourly) So of course I had to write everything down to have solid proof that my hours got cut so I would actually recieve the money I worked my butt off for. Not to mention,  the pay wasnt anything extra, as I was barely making 20K of Czech crowns a month / Around 800 USD . Might you say it's a lot, but the prices are high here as well. The rent alone cost me pretty much 400$ monthly, the food was around 150$ monthly and I had to get to work somehow. Since I dont have drivers licence yet, I was using the public transport which was overall 70 dollars not to mention to pay for my health and social insurance. So I was left with nothing much as I'm trying to save what I can.

Recently,  I managed to find more decent job, as my dad helped me, since he is basically one of the highest ranked managers in a security company which hires receptionist,  bodyguards and stuff like that. Of course,  I wouldnt get accepted here if it wouldn't be for him, since clearly you need at least finished high school with any profession to work here. The money arent that much better but at least it's a job I really like ,  plus I managed to get a part time job here as well, on my own. I now live with a roomate,  or more like moved over to her since she has her parents house and didnt want to live alone. But it goes get lonely, since we both are spending most of our time at work and never really see each other.

However to finally get to the point. I do actually want to finish my school but I do not know how , nor where or what even are my possibilities.  I tried to apply , but this year, everything's full already. I want to try next year again, but that means I currently have some free time to try and get a driver license or get some course once I'll eventually have enough money, but at the end, I do not know what to really do or what even are my chances and possibilities as I said. 

 I am quite close to giving up and just admitting that I am just another useless member of society which didnt manage to get even her school done - No hate to people like this, as I adore them how are they holding up and the fact you dont have finished degree doesnt mean you can't do amazing things - But I pretty much know that I wont be able to do anything amazing. I'm just average. So I'm turning here to share and ask for help because, I just have no other idea and maybe I am a bit desperate. I will appreciate any help or advice.",college,I got kicked out and now struggle with school / Asking4Help,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/x5gntk/i_got_kicked_out_and_now_struggle_with_school/,1662293622.0

TL;DR: what is your personal average time studying/homework? No advice please. Only asking for your experience. Go into as much detail as you’d like (I like stories and such). 

I realize it’s been asked a trillion times, however, I’m not asking for some magical number that you think is perfect for everyone to achieve success in school. The truth is, everyone’s workload is going to be different depending on what classes they take (RIP engineers and math majors). 

But I also think that it’s worth asking again, as workloads also change over time. For instance, college is completely different for this generation of young adults compared to how it was for our parents, grandparents, etc.,.

I’m (21) curious. I’m a first year adult student. I dropped out of high school; fell into a toxic crowd; struggled with mental illness….

Anyway, I’m currently undeclared (most likely going to double major chemistry and philosophy; plan on going to med school). all my classes are gen Ed so it’s been pretty easy. I’m taking one honors class, ENGL. So far, I’ve been spending 1-2 hours [+ what I can get done during my free time on campus] on schoolwork a day. It’s impossible for me to spend any more than that. I work outside of school and my commute to both work and school eats up ~1 hour of my day already.  On top of the fact I have a doggo to take care of ❤️ 

Even so, I became burned out this past week and took Thursday and Friday off from my studies. I have bipolar II so sacrificing sleep for anything is never an option, and I’m still paying the price for that. I’ve realized I have to seriously cut back a little. I actually enjoy my classes and the work so it was fun for me to hyper focus. But I haven’t made time for proper sleep and socialization. 

Anyhow, I’m curious about your experience. Please do share! I’m not looking for advice, as I’m pretty decent at time management. I just want to know about your personal study/homework time!

Went to college out of highschool, I was a straight A and B student. The second I got to college I failed every single class besides engineering. Then dropped out after one semester.

Now it feels like I’m even further behind than I was after high school. I’m struggling with basic algebra and stoichiometry/conversions. Barely passed Bio 101. 

The more I try to focus the less everything makes sense. It feels like my brain is getting smushed. The worst part is that it’s online school, and the explanation for why I got the question wrong just reads like gibberish. 

I’ve attended multiple zooms for office hours and nothing seems to help. I’m genuinely considering dropping out for a second time. But i feel as though I wasted a big part of my life if I do that, because the whole reason I joined the military was to get free college.

during the fall of my sophomore year. I worked super hard
to get into the top house at my university &amp; truly enjoyed
the whole recruitment process. The philanthropy hits
super close to home &amp; that's the main reason that I chose
that sorority. I was in a super bad place mentally due to
wanting to be super popular and find friends, on top of
transitioning from completely online school to completely
in person because of the pandemic.
I got the shit end of the stick when it comes to a big. long
story short, she SAd me &amp; I'm in the process of pressing
charges still. The sorority was very supportive of me
through it. Although my big dropped before there could
be any punishment, they immediately put her on every
blacklist ever. (The only person left in my fam that hasn't
dropped would be my big's twin.) I genuinely think if I
rejoined, they'd 100% get me a new big. It's the least that
they could do.
Anyways, after that I was asking the world to give me a
sign to stay in the sorority or not. I applied for an
executive position, VP of DEl (diversity, equity and
inclusion) that was right above the position i was
appointed to, (i was director of DEl). I was a double major
in poli sci and criminology, i was perfect for it. I was told
that I'd get it no doubt. Then when it came to announcing
the position, it was given to someone who ""unknowingly""
was EXTREMELY racist, homophobic, and sexist. I fought
until I was blue in the face to get her out of that position.
She ended up being kicked out of her position AND
dropped, but some people hold a grudge against me for
being the one that had that done. I then realized that the
sign was given, and I then dropped.
Fast forward to now. My two best friends have transferred
and I am lonely and bored. I don't even know if I can re-
join after dropping, but I really want to. After my SA my whole life has changed. My perception on life, my
priorities. evervthing. I've never been so focused on bettering myself than now. I truly believe that I am a
different person who is completely focused on school &amp;
bettering my mental health. However, I miss being a part
of something so badly. I miss being around other strong
women. I miss being excited to raise money for our philo
and others. I miss dressing up and taking pictures. I want
the ability to have a little and treat them with the love that
I was never given. I want to reclaim that family back and
start my own.

I didn’t really have a “dream” school growing up. I just knew I wanted to go away for school and wanted a place with a great social life. My grades in HS were pretty average/slightly above average (usually 87-90 type) which is good enough to get into decent state schools. But I always wanted to major in nursing, which for those of you who don’t know is an *extremely* competitive major, so for some of the schools I applied to I got into the university but not the program. 

I also only wanted to go to a school that gave me direct entry to the major out of HS. I didn’t want to risk the chance of going to a school, making a bunch of friends, really loving it then not getting into the program and having to leave. Like I said, I was a pretty average student. I was realistic with myself enough to know I probably wasn’t going to average a 3.7 in my pre-reqs. So I chose the 1 school that gave me direct entry and didn’t require me to take the TEAS (entrance exam to the major.)

I go to a small private school in Philadelphia most people probably haven’t heard of. Academically, it’s great. My professors are amazing. Good clinical experiences. My grades are stellar (after a rough first semester.) And I feel prepared to be a nurse. But I’ve made no friends. My roommate freshman year was like my sister and we did everything together but she unfortunately dropped out. I haven’t met anyone I’ve clicked with like that since. 

It’s been hard for me seeing people I know have so much fun and make so much friends at their schools and know that I wanted that for myself and it just didn’t happen. Going into my last year finally accepting my college experience wasn’t what I wanted it to be.

78,zucky199,1661227632,/r/college/comments/wver6s/looking_for_advice_im_in_debt_with_nothing_to/,"Hello. I was wondering if I could get any advice. I (23m) have failed most of the classes I have taken in college over the 4 semesters I've been in school. My GPA is less than 1.0, and I have been put on academic probation after I had my third strike last semester. I'm so sad that I haven't accomplished anything since I've left highschool, and I keep debating suicide. To catch you up to speed of my current situation I will give you a brief summary of what i have done since I've left highschool. At 19 I finished highschool after taking an unnecessary victory lap, and then immediately went into a 3 year advanced diploma for social working. I had little interest in the program, but my parents pushed me towards a health care profession and this one seemed the least bad. I ended up failing to make the grade in most of my classes in the first semester. Second semester went a little better since I passed all the classes I failed in the previous semester, but I left the program and dropped out of school after my residency in the college dorms was up. I was now 20 and living at home with no job, and no intentions of going back to school unless I knew what I wanted to do. After about 2 months of being home I left early one morning to take a bus to the city. My intentions that day were to jump off an infamous bridge in order to end my own life. About 500 meters away from the bridge and I panicked and had a melt down. I then returned the other direction and eventually walked nearby a military recruiters location. I entered it and applied to take an aptitude test. I then took a bus home, and when i arrived home i told my parents I was applying for the military. They didn't seem to understand since I was not making sense for my reasons for wanting to apply. My reason at the time that i didn't share with them was I felt stuck, and I was hoping I could encourage  myself snap out of my depression and put myself together before I sent off to basic training. Months of back and forth went on and I still hadn't changed. I had this awful french recruiter yell at me trying to scare me, and make me tell him if I had any mental illnesses. I hated how he was talking to me so I lied through my teeth, and told him I didn't have any problems. If he was good at his job maybe he could have seen that I had psyche assement earlier that year that would have told him I was unwell, not to mention the planned suicide I failed on attempting earlier that year, or the actual attempt I made a couple years prior to that. Months pass and I have a job at a ski resort. After only 2 months of working their I get a call from their office about a vehicle tech position I have been offered. It wasn't even what I planned on going for since I have little interest in cars, but the musician, and electrician jobs I also applied for were not offered to me. I took the offer, and 2 weeks later I was flying up to the traing facility. That place has left me with so many bad memories, and has drove me to want to kill myself once again. I VR'd about half way through my training because I got to the point where I didn't understand why I was there; I guess in that sense I did snap out of my funk, but only out of fear since every minute I was there I got more and more anxious and depressed. Some of the other platoon members started to pick on me, and I was constantly was being called homophobic slurs from my fire team partner. I also couldn't get any sleep while I was there because of the required work load which caused me to stay up later in order to complete it and not get into trouble with my commanding officers. So that whole experience was a nightmare, and now I'm just resentful of the military. After that experience I applied for school again to take on a trades program before I entered a 4 year degree program. I thought being an electrician could be a worth it so I applied to a electricians program and got in. The program ended up getting pushed back because of the pandemic, but to matters worse they sent out an email that never ended up getting to me asking if I still wanted to pursue the program because it was going to be delayed 1 semester. I had no issues with that so I thought that since they didn't send me anything regarding anything else that I would be fine. Fast forward to the Winter semester and I contact the school as to why I haven't received my timetable yet, and I'm told that I'm not enrolled because I didn't respond to an email that was sent to me. I checked every since email I had and I couldn't find it anywhere; because it was probably never sent to me. I reapply for the program in the fall and come September I'm finally in school again after 2 years of not being enrolled. I end up failing most of my classes, and decided to switch programs based on what a guidance counselor had said to me. I switch into general arts and sciences because of the bust of the previous semester and despite being more interested in this program I failed to have my GPA meet a 1.0. This brings me to my current situation of my academic probation period I'm on. A couple other issues like working at walmart, parents not helping me financially at all, and my living situation also factor into but I feel that I have already wrote enough. I want to know what I should do about school. I'm over 10000 dollars in debt, and I feel like a failure.

I actually do pay legitimate attention in mental health matters and psychology - I’m 40-ish pages ahead on “push” by sapphire even tho I haven’t read consistently in yrs, yet did have to put it down yesterday j bc the abuse was getting to be a bit too much. 

I think I tend to worry abt the judgement of others a little too much even tho I’ve gotten a lot better about this over the years and no longer care about being “popular” like I once did. I know now that I am simply not the popular type. And don’t care anymore. 

I’m very worried about making a bad decision in regards to the job I end up choosing? I know people switch jobs all the time and all, and that I have time but… since my family doesn’t have consistent financial comfort/stability, I’m especially worried abt making a bad decision. 

I know I want a job that’s preferably high paying - hopefully no less than average income - but idk, I actually resent my parents for not trying to save up money before having kids or just idk not being reasonable in their planning. 

I wouldn’t say that I’m good at making friends. I can actually be somewhat inclined to be cynical or pessimistic. I don’t fully trust other people, but this is actually largely due to personal life experiences.

I’ve wanted to be “successful” before but never actually did what successful ppl do - gotten my sleep, worn makeup (but to be fair it wouldn’t have worked w braces, etc.) 

I used to make the mistake of letting too many people follow my private spam acc and talking abt people on there.

I fear ending up homeless or like my parents. I want to have two kids. I actually rlly like doing research on a topic if I’m curious about the topic and can have a good memory for different facts and information.

# For Those Looking To Go To College

If you are in high school right now, and are stressing about the fact that you have to make a very big decision in the coming years about how the rest of your life is going to play out, please take a breather. Preparing for college and finding the best fit for you feels like it is the end of the world, but weigh all of your options and shoot for your goals no matter what. Here's some directed tips for making a good application.

Do Something in high school. It may seem like it's your time to relax and do whatever you want, but if you want to make a good argument for a college to take you in, find something you're good at and do something related to it. Join some clubs, play some sports, volunteer somewhere, take hard exams, don't do *nothing*. Something that I see all too often is people complaining that they didn't do anything in high school to make their application stand out, and the key to solving this problem is to just do *something.* 

Take the ACT/SAT seriously. If you are planning on going to a state school, and even in some cases other schools, the ACT/SAT is your ticket to some golden opportunities. I've seen some very prominent schools offer missive discounts on tuition if you do well on these exams, and for the most part they won't even consider you unless you have done fairly well on them or your parents are alumni/rich. For me, if I got a really good score on the ACT/SAT, my state school would nearly take off all of tuition, and so for 2 years I tried over and over to achieve that goal. Eventually it happened, and I got a very good discount on my education. If you are worried about finances when it comes to college, this is a *very important thing to work towards.*

Take more difficult classes. If you go into college with only base level high school graduate understanding, you are going to be in a world of hurt when you have to actually start doing homework for once. If your school offers AP level classes, I recommend to take at least a few to feel out a college level education. If your school offer community college classes for free, *jump on that opportunity as soon as possible.* It doesn't matter if you know what you want to do in college yet, just get the base level pre-requisite classes / general education classes done, as most transfer to most other schools. Classes like composition, psychology, and even oral communication are great options as nearly every major needs it. In my junior-senior summer of high school I took 4 courses at my local community college, as the tuition there was much cheaper than at the 4 year I was planning on going to. ***Understand what transfers and what doesn't, don't take any courses that will waste your money unless you are trying out a potential major you might find interesting.***

# For Those Just Going Into College

College is a scary thing, you're away from your usual life and being put in a situation that is uncomfortable and disorienting. The first thing to understand is that *every, single, person is feeling the* ***exact same way.*** There are those who like to pretend that it's cool and that they have it all figured out. ***Unless they've been to college before, they really don't.*** Understand yourself, take care of yourself first and foremost, and *then* worry about other people. You don't have to make friends with anyone right away, and not *everyone* does like some other people might be saying. Your college experience is *your* college experience. The faster you turn it into something you enjoy, the better off you'll be. So let's say you just dropped off everything in your dorm room and your parents just left, here's some advice.

Don't feel pressure to do anything you don't want to do. If everyone around you is drinking and they pass you a beer, *only take it if you want to.* If they get angry at you for not drinking it, then maybe they aren't the best group to be around. If you *ever* see hard drugs, (and I know I'm going to get flak for this, but oh well), stay the hell away from them. I have so many friends that have turned to party drugs and not one of them has ever told me that it has made them feel better about their life *while they were sober.* If someone's still buzzed, they'll tell you that they feel on top of the world, but understand that college and drug addiction is not a good combo for *anyone*. Ultimately, the choice is still yours, but if you don't want to waste the opportunity you've been given, please stay somewhat clean.

Don't worry about finding your own crowd. You'll see people walking up and down the streets in big 'ol groups and you'll probably get depressed if you're alone. Everyone feels the same way (for the most part) and don't worry about it. I've talked with *a lot* of college kids and almost everyone just randomly finds friends. It's not something you work towards, as if you build yourself up too much your anxiety will leave a bad first impression, and in college that's the only thing you have to base your relationships with others off of. Find people like you through time, and eventually you'll be fine, sometimes it just takes quite a while...

Classes. Hit your classes hard and heavy in the beginning. Take notes, read material, study, do homework, and actually *try* on exams. Humanity's worst enemy is regret, and by flunking the first midterm it will drag your mind for the rest of the semester. Do your absolute best and stay up to date in every class and *then* do the other things you want to do. If this becomes too difficult as the semester drags on, *take less semester hours next semester.* Nothing is more important than academics in college, and I'll explain why later. Do your best, and put forth the effort you know you can, and you will be just fine.

Stay away from time sinks (or at least limit yourself). Reddit, tiktok, snapchat, video games, etc. Nothing is more important than school, besides building relationships and maintaining yourself. Don't lay in your bed for 8 hours watching 30 second videos, don't take pictures of yourself and send it to your friends. Find time to actually go somewhere and study with them, and above all *make sure your current workload is done.* I see people all the damn time coming to me and asking me for extensions on homework's that are *2 weeks old.* Unless you have massive life events that have drastically altered your ability to complete work, please leave out the dull excuses of *I just forgot.* Your TAs and Professors are there to help you, not be your servant at your every whim. (And google is always an option, especially for certain questions.)

This one is short. Get a planner. remember them agenda things they gave you in elementary where you could write down due dates and shit? Turns out, it's really helpful in college too. This will solve your 'get hit in the head with an anxiety rush at 10pm realizing there's an assignment due tonight' episodes. 

# Finances

This is a biggy, a real biggy. College costs a lot of money, and there is no reason why you should have to graduate with any college debt if you *play your cards* ***extremely well.*** It does suck if you're late to the game, but a majority of tuition can be taken off if you do well on your standardized tests. If you're a first generation student, there's scholarships for that too. If you're a Brainiac, colleges will just take off a bunch of tuition for your essays you write for their scholarships. ***WORK DURING SUMMERS AND WINTERS IF POSSIBLE, ESPECIALLY SUMMERS.*** If you play this card really well, you can actually avoid working during the semester as well as you can have your savings you make during the off season pay for your rent during the semesters. If you need more for rent and food, find more time to work during the semester.  Be a TA, do research, work for your university, etc. Always apply for scholarships that you think you qualify for, and if you want to get a lot more of them, fill out the FAFSA to prove you demonstrate financial need. Take a semester off and keep building savings if you really need too, but most of the times the job you come out of college with can pay off your debt relatively quickly so save that option for desperate measures.

For me, I've already received so much in scholarships that I don't pay tuition anymore, just rent. This comes from having a high GPA, filling out the general application for scholarships my school puts out, as well as filling out my engineering general application as well. For most of the scholarships I have to write thank you letters to my donors, which isn't much for how much I am receiving from them. ***This is why having a higher GPA matters, it makes you stand out among other applicants on a very defined scale. The better you do in college, the less it's going to cost you in the long run.*** 

Don't go to college if you don't believe you'll do well in it. Trades is nothing to sneeze at when it comes to making money in life, and it's a much more affordable option when it comes to down payment. Doing bad in college is very costly, dropping out normally forfeits a lot of progress and results in you spending money for nothing.

I would also have time to get a part time job and be able to move out sooner, and I'll also be a lot less stressed.

In short, I want to help reform the current state of mental health, trauma, and addiction treatment by advocating for, researching, and providing alternative treatments such as Somatic Therapy, MBCT, etc. I'm particularly interested in working to help those with dissociative-type disorders to restore a connection to their body.

I know in order to do this, I should become some form of Psychologist or Social Worker, but there are some reasons why I haven't done this: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. I don't understand enough about the pathway to these degrees to be able to decide where to start from where I am at.
2. I want my undergrad to be a clear path to a plan B. I am worried by the time I get to graduate school, it may get to be too much on top of work and other life responsibilities, and I know either of these fields as a BA/BS are practically useless. 
3. I would like to travel, move states, and possibly live abroad, and I know from talking to some LCSW's that licensing can be a bit restrictive as far as where you live.
4. I don't know which of the two, Psychology or Social Work, is right for me. I would also like the option to participate in research and clinical therapy, which I know is asking a lot.

 To expand on point 2, I have some options. The careers I'm already qualified for have advancements with a Bachelor's degree (TEFL and teaching yoga), and it doesn't matter what degree. However, since I know it is not necessary to get an undergrad in the same field as your graduate, I want to learn a skill that might open up yet another career pathway, compliment my eventual career goals, or at least be personally enriching or fun to learn in some way.

For example, I have personal interests in music, the arts, agriculture, linguistics, sustainability, computer sciences, etc. (hence why it has taken so long to figure out what I want to do, lol). My questions are, is it smarter to/easier to...:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Undergrad in something to compliment my graduate degree and open another career door (for example, music therapy, which only requires a Bachelor's)?
2. Undergrad in something of personal interest (like sustainable agriculture, audio engineering, graphic design, etc.)?
3. Undergrad in the fields I'm interested in getting a Graduate's degree in?

&amp;#x200B;

87,Pristine-Yogurt-490,1660514754,/r/college/comments/woi3sj/tips_for_making_friends/,"I've seen a lot of people asking how to make friends and if it's hard to make friends in college. I'll tell you all my experience.

In my freshman year, I arrived on campus a week before everyone else to participate in a program meant just for First Gen students. In this program, we met other first gens and were paired with upperclassmen buddies to help us and stuff throughout the year. In this group, I made a few acquaintances and then had 5 closer friends that I hung out with on a daily basis. I also ended up making like 2-3 more friends later in the year once other people got to campus. Sadly that original 5-person group didn't last long. Three of them dropped out and the last two didn't really talk to me after COVID hit making us all leave campus and go home.

Sophomore year comes around and I still talked to the two girls that I met the year prior a little bit here and there. One of them actually lived down the hall from me. However, I was alone the majority of the year. It wasn't until just before finals that I gained more friends. This group of friends included two girls that I had gone to high school with and a girl that I had considered being roommates with during my Freshman year. This group of friends is the one I'm currently still with today and it's even grown within this past year.

I'm now going to be a Senior in college and I have some of the closest friends I think I've ever had.

Now for some tips on making friends:

\- On move-in day, keep your door open. This will allow others to see you and think they may want to talk to you.

\- Dont be afraid to introduce yourself to neighbors in your dorm building

\- Go to 1st-week activities. Here you will meet tons of people and make connections

\- Club Fair!! Join clubs. Yet again another way to meet people and have people to hang out with.

\- Try to spend less time in your dorm. Shutting yourself up in your dorm is not good for you.

\- Go to at least one football game and tailgate. Homecoming is always the best one to go to.

\- Go to Homecoming events.

92,Hammahness808,1660381567,/r/college/comments/wna05d/how_to_overcome_fear_of_failure/,"To begin, I graduated from High School in 2017 as a Suma Cum Laude, earning every honors I could get (CTE, STEM, etc) with a 3.8 gpa almost getting Valedictorian if I got a 4.0. I’ve always been an overachiever in high school with only getting a C in PE (lol) and a B in AP calculus. Those two classes to this day, I still look back and wish I done better. When I found out I wasn’t going to get valedictorian I felt extremely disappointed in myself despite majority of my friends and family being very proud of me.

After graduation, my original plan was to go to a Mainland college to get a Software Engineering degree, since I’m from Hawaii and UH only has computer science, but I changed my mind last minute to go to my local community college and then transfer to the main university as it was a very much cheaper option because the thought of failing and wasting my parent’s money terrified me.

My first year and a half of college was extremely easy, being the only one in my cohort program to pass basic college level english, a lot of classmates coming to me for help with classes, and even managing to get my first job as a math tutor. When my 4th semester came, I was finally able to do classes related to my field, such as intro to programming, discrete mathematics, systems analysis, etc. Discrete math and programming was probably the highlight of that semester as well because it was the most fun classes I took so far.

As time went on, the classes I had to take became mostly online classes, with lectures being prerecorded to watch. I started to become bored, unenthusiastic, and no longer motivated. Some of the classes I had to take felt irrelevant and redundant to me, such as Operating Systems (which was literally just a class teaching you how to use Linux) and Databases (SQL). It got to a point where I had no motivation at all and I cheated my way through some classes just because I didn’t want to study for them. Then out of nowhere it hit me; I wasn’t learning anything anymore. I was on my last semester to get my associates before I transfer to the main university when I had that realization and I was afraid I would’ve probably did the same thing for the rest of college, take some higher-level classes where knowledge of previous material was needed, and fail hard. This stressed me out so much, I had a mental breakdown and took a break from college.

Fast forward to 2022, I’ve been working at Starbucks for the past 2 years. After seeing a very close friend of mine get his Bachelors in Network security and getting a job in his field within 2 weeks of graduation, I decided it was finally time for me to get my life on track. I decided to go to my original first choice school which is Montana Tech University as a transfer student to see if things could play out differently and I start school on the 22nd. Throughout the summer I spent as much time as I could with my friends as possible. The last day we all hung out together, they all gave me a combined sum of $300, which I am extremely grateful for, but it made me upset. To me, it just felt like it added more weight on my shoulders. My mom gave me $500 which only made it worse. My dad literally told me if I fail, don’t come home. At this point, I really CAN’T fail but that’s the only thing on my mind. Deep down, I know I can do it but the prospect of failure seems to cloud my judgement. My main concern is that i haven’t been in school for 2 years, and I’m worried that I forgot a lot of the things related to my field. Right now I just want to know how to get past this fear of failure or at least, find enough motivation to keep going, to not get lazy if anything.

TL:DR
Was a overachiever in high school. Ended up going to local community college in fear of wasting family’s money if I failed going to out-of-state college. Got bored and lost motivation overtime and started cheating. Dropped out when I wasn’t learning anything. Worked at Starbucks for 2 years.

Let me explain: I took 2 purely random classes when I was 18 just to have something to do. I wasnt planning on getting a degree or anything with them. Paid out of pocket but dropped them due to my mother kicking me out because she wanted to move and frankly not take her with me.

WGU will not admit to their school due to my low GPA from those classes I dropped out of despite me graduating HS with a 3.4 GPA.

I am scared of failure since I have always done poorly in school but I want to make my parents proud. I want to become successful in life…I’m tired of being a fucking bum.

The last time I was in school is when I was 19 and I didn’t take it seriously I fucked around and dropped out once I failed a test. Instead of not giving up and retaking it I ended up giving up like a weak little bitch. I realized how important my education truly is if I want to have a good life in the future. The only thing that is holding me back is failure I’m afraid of drowning in debt all for nothing if I end up failing once again.

I'm a non-traditional student who dropped out of high school at the beginning of 10th grade and obtained my GED about a decade ago. The last math class I remember taking was Algebra I, and to be honest most of it is a blur to me now. While taking the college's placement test, there were some questions that I did not know how to solve for at all, however, I managed to answer them correctly due to process of elimination. Due to that, I scored high enough to place into College Algebra or Pre-Calc. Which leads me to the following options:

1. Should I take Pre-Calc or College Algebra, even if I feel I'm not ready for it? The advisors seem to be pushing me to take College Algebra, but I feel like I'm not ready for it just yet.
2. I talked to some advisors about this, and they recommended that I take College Algebra with a corequisite Foundations of College Algebra course. Should I do this?
3. Personally, I'm considering taking Beginning Algebra with a corequisite Foundations of Beginning Algebra for this semester. Is this a good idea, or should I follow the advisor's advice?

I know taking the Beginning Algebra courses would make it take longer to obtain my degree, but is it worth it for me to build a better foundation of knowledge before attempting College Algebra? Or at the very least, should I take those courses first to serve as a nice refresher?

Except...

The cost is about five thousand dollars.

However. If I do go, that takes two weeks out of my time to work this month which makes it even harder to make back and pay what I owe this month.

If I don't go, I can pay off my late rent and the rest of my expenses. But I will still be charged for the Equidor trip and have to pay that later.

But, if I do go, all expenses together, I'll be short about even hundred dollars this month for my living expenses and likely won't have an apartment anymore.

so i dropped out and decided ima take some time off to decide what exactly i wanted to do. i still wanted to do CS so i’m sticking with that and will be going to my CC this year to get my associates, i can finish it off in 1yr as i did dual enrollment so i got the basic gen ed’s off. 

but i am going in doing algebra for the fall as i wasn’t able to test out of it. so i will need to get to calc 2 to complete my associates. which leaves me doing precalc this upcoming spring, then calc 1 in the summer and then calc 2 in the fall of 2023 to then transfer for spring. 

i was thinking to apply for the schools i want to go to for fall 2023 instead of spring 2023 as i just really want to get out of the house ASAP. so i would have to do calc 1 &amp; 2 back to back in summer or just take calc 2 at whatever uni i end up going to. the only reason i’m kinda worried is that i am guaranteed admission to another state school of mines if i get my AS at a CC within the state, the other school is fine regardless of what path i take. but my state U i feel like i have a good shot at getting in without the program butttt i honestly don’t know. my friends aren’t too helpful with an extra POV so i came here, so any thoughts/criticisms are welcome.

I have a semester of credits from my previous uni, where I dropped out after a year. My GPA there was bad, and it was 1 semester of credits that made up maybe 4 classes. I also have a decent amount of college credits from high school.

I intend to go back to CC, then transfer out back into a different 4-year. At this point I do not intend to apply to high-tier schools but I do hope to get a scholarship at my (relatively competitive) state school. I would like to keep my GPA as high as possible in case transfer to a competitive private college becomes an option.

Ideally I would be at CC for only 1 year then transfer out to a different college for 2 years for a total of 4 years. I would like to know which of these options is possible, and if more than one seem doable, which one sounds like the best option for me moving forward? My GPA at my first college was bad enough that it would ruin my GPA at CC.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I transfer my semester of credits from my 1st college and graduate CC in a year. This brings down my GPA but allows me to safely finish CC in 1 year.
2. I don't transfer my credits from my 1st college, and finish my associates in 1 year. This is risky but would probably give me a good chance at a better GPA. I am worried the 4-year would ask why I have a 2-year gap between high school and CC.
3. I don't transfer my credits from my 1st college, and finish my associates in 2 years. I am really hoping to avoid this option as it means I would graduate very late.

Dear Financial Aid Office:

I'm -------, an incoming sophomore majoring in -------'s animation program. I was previously offered the St. Vincent DePaul Scholarship, which was significantly helpful in my attending. However, because I was not able to earn 12 credits in my spring term, the scholarship was not renewed for the 2022-2023 school year.

In the first term, I finished with a 3.220 GPA. However, after winter break, I got my first job. At the time, I believed I would be able to handle the workload from both school and it, but clearly I was not. At first through the second term, the hours were manageable at 15 hours a week, but even the quality of my work was decreasing as my cumulative GPA dropped. Because I worked later hours, I had to go to work immediately after class, so that meant that I had far less access to the campus and its utilities. This proved to be a detriment to my work, as I had increasingly less time to spare for my projects. This became worse in my spring term in which my hours were bumped up to 25-30 hours per week. The classes I took for this semester were also far more out of my depth, which necessitated more time to be spent learning that I did not have anymore. Although this does not excuse my failure to meet the requirements for the scholarship, I know that this failure is not reflective of me or my work and I intend to make that clear with the upcoming year.

This upcoming year, I am far more prepared for the workload college entails and what I need to succeed. Firstly, I am not going to work during the school session. I want to make my education my first priority again and take full advantage of the campus and everything it has to offer. And now that I have the time to do so, I plan to be on campus far more, which would allow me to be able to work with my peers and professors. I plan on having a more concrete peer group that shares schedules and classes with me. If need be, I will reach out to find tutors or make time for one-on-one meetings with my professors.

--------- has such a rich and creative community, especially for animation, and I want to be a part of it. I am confident that I can make the changes necessary to improve and that I can maintain that success for the duration of my degree.

116,pestopastababy,1658542558,/r/college/comments/w5s6ex/my_education_keeps_getting_delayed_and_its_so/,"CW: Mentions of mental health and family abuse.

I graduated high school in 2018. 

I had no idea what I truly wanted to do, I was under a lot of pressure. In 2019 I started a course at uni but was having a mental breakdown because of it, bursting into tears in the middle of class, lying on the ground and crying while
students walked around me between classes… it was bad. 

I dropped out after a few weeks. I tried to focus on myself and figuring out what to do. I couldn’t find a job. I was living with emotionally and physically abusive parents. Basically, my mental health was pretty bad. 

I started a new course in semester 2 of 2019 and although I kind of liked it, it was an arts degree so I felt like I had no direction/purpose. That combined with my still terrible mental health meant that I could hardly even manage to study part time. I studied that course part time from 2019-2020 and towards the end, I was failing classes because I just wasn’t coping. Online learning and social isolation because of COVID was not helping.

In early 2021, the abuse from my
parents got worse. My father almost choked me and my mother blamed me for it. My parents separated and my mother kicked my father out, and then the kicked me out (she did give me notice though, so I had time to
find a place). 

I moved out, and my life felt like it was starting to improve. Everything was so chaotic with me moving and trying to adjust to my new life, so I decided to defer uni for a year while I thought about what I wanted to do. 

Finally, towards the end of 2021, I figured it out. So at the start of 2022, I enrolled to study education and I got a job working with kids (before you say this is a bad career, I am not American and teaching is a good career in my country). 

I have loved working with the kids, and finally for the first time in my life, I feel confident about what career I want. It’s also been great to earn money and gain experience while studying. 

Now in mid 2022, it feels like everything is going to shit again. My friend and I are being forced to find a new place on short notice thanks to a shitty landlord situation. The only place we could find on short notice that we cam both afford as students, is meh in terms of location, but is a nice apartment. 

I am scared that I can’t handle packing and moving, whilst also working almost every day (my job will be a one hour commute on public transport each way from the new place). I am also supposed to be starting the second semester of my teaching degree next week. It’s a full time course and I don’t know how I’ll manage it. 

And to top it off, yesterday I tested positive for COVID. So now I feel like shit, I’m coughing and vomiting all day, and I can barely get out of bed. I’m going to miss the first week back at uni, and potentially the second week too if I’m not better. 

I’m scared that I could have to defer uni because I don’t know if I can handle all of this. I’d have to defer for a whole year because of how the course is structured. 

It’s all SO FRUSTRATING. This is a four year full time course. If I’d known what I was doing from the start, and had good mental health and a non-abusive family, this would already be my last year. I would have been GRADUATING this year. But no, I have to see all the people
from my year in high school graduate, whilst I am still in the first year of my course and am unsure when I’ll even graduate.

It would break my heart if I couldn’t become a teacher. It’s so important to me now, I can’t picture my life without it. I’m already working with kids and it’s great, I feel like the teaching degree is too long. Three years sounds like enough, four just feels like dragging it out. 

I am so TIRED of living on an extremely low income because I’m a student. If I only graduate in 2025 or 2026, I will basically be in my mid 20s. It will have taken me 7-8 years from high school to get a degree. That kills me. It’s not fair. 

I always pictured myself getting married and having kids around my late-20s to early-30s. But now, my entire life will be delayed further so that is less likely to happen. Nobody will want to settle down with someone who is still a poor undergrad student in their mid 20s. They will want someone who is already financially secure in their proper career. Most teachers in my country graduate around age 22. I’m already 21. I feel so BEHIND. 

I want to be able to SAVE MONEY. Be a proper teacher with my own classroom. I want to be able to buy my own house instead of renting. I want to be able to afford driving lessons and a car. I want to buy healthy groceries instead of just the cheapest options. I want to be able to go on holidays and live like an actual adult. I don’t want to feel embarrassed on first dates anymore when I realise that the other person has already graduated and gotten into their career, whilst I am still on the same level as someone who just finished high school.  

I know that there is no point complaining, and I’ve just got to

117,dumb-wishes,1658475852,/r/college/comments/w54ks9/i_am_falling_behind_and_burnt_out_and_i_do_not/,"Hey guys!

I am a 19f and am going to my second year at a community college. I graduated high school Summa Cum Laude and mostly A's and about 2-3 B's, all while dealing with extracurriculars and depression and anxiety.

My major is criminal justice and honestly, it is something that I have no love for. My parents are the people who are responsible for me taking this path. Overtime, I developed a love for makeup and found an interest in social work, specifically in CPS. I came from an abusive home and I wanted to help children out of that situation as well. I told my parents about me wanting to pursue cosmetology/business and/or social work, and needless to say, they were quiet angry, so I dropped that idea and pursued what they wanted me to do. 

Now, I started my first year of college 2021 and did amazing. I got straight A's and a 4.0/President's List, considering that I am the oldest and had no guidance whatsoever. Then came my spring semester...my spring semester is something I do not like to think about as it is one that I struggled heavily with mentally. I was doing well until I started the 8-week sociology class which drained everything out of me. I luckily passed and although, my GPA lowered I did not mind as long as I was above a 3.5 because I have a big scholarship to keep. Well, I took a few summer classes, in hopes to advance and take a load off me for later semesters. Unfortunately, since I plan on transferring to a Cal State one of my graduation requirements is a PoliSci class, and without a doubt, is one of the classes that I have failed so much at, sitting at a D currently. It is of no help that my PoliSci professor uses 2-year-old lectures and gives us very little time for exams. I am more of a visual learner and like having captions but he removed that altogether so it takes me more time than usual to actually absorb information. After all that, the exams have little of the information he speaks about on his lectures and he allows no textbooks during exams  and has the Canvas setting that you cannot return to a question after you answered it so I am at a stuck. 

My parents know nothing about this as if I were to let them know they would absolutely annihilate me, but they have no idea that college is not as easy as they thought it would be or how easy people told them it was. It is already hard enough that I am struggling with my mental illnesses on top of caring for a house and a child when they go to work. I am extremely nervous as I already have a few late assignments for my second class and I do not even want to check my grade for my PoliSci class. I am scared of losing my scholarship and scared of failing. 

I recently started therapy again in secret, because my parents do not believe in my mental illnesses/mental health. I looked into applying to the college's disability center but that would mean having to go to my doctor and asking for a medical record and would require one of my parents to take so that is a no. I have very little resources and struggle daily and am burnt out and I try to make it clear but they say that this is a sacrifice for my success and the career I am pursuing.

I cannot continue sacrificing myself or my mental health anymore, nor do I want to pursue a career I know I will be unhappy in. I was advised by my therapist that I should look into what I want to do and apply myself towards it, but I fear the idea that I will have to restart all over again. Is it worth it? Is there anything I can do to prevent myself from falling behind next semester and continue the cycle again? Any help is appreciated!!",college,I am falling behind and burnt out and I do not know what to do anymore.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/w54ks9/i_am_falling_behind_and_burnt_out_and_i_do_not/,1658493852.0

i graduated high school in 2021. i have no idea my gpa but i want to email someone from my school to see if i can get my unofficial one i just dont know which staff member to email. i also didnt tale my act/sat cuz schools weren’t requiring it from covid.

at this time i got accepted in john jay for forensic psychology but i couldnt go cuz i couldnt afford somewhere to live there and i had to stay at my brothers. 

i went to a college in massachusetts but i dropped out mid semester. i couldnt find a place to live so i was temporarily doing online classes but i was also dealing with being almost homeless and having to move in with my brother so i just dropped out. i obvi didnt get any credits from there 

then in january of this year i decided to do a semester at my local cc. the school sucks and i have no excuse for it but i fucked up and i didnt earn any credits for that semester. 

now the next semester is coming and im on my own for all college related finances and idk if i should even bother going or wait. i am moving back to my home city (nyc which costs an arm and a leg ik lol) and im aiming to leave by next year. basically as soon as possible i just want a couple grand in my savings as a crutch 

my dream job is as a film director so im currently getting a certificate from nyu and yellowbrick in film essentials bc i dont have a film school near me im in the middle of upstate new york. 

i was thinking of just working on my portfolio for a year and working to save up and move out. i basically have already taken a gap year and it honestly makes me feel weird and off bc ive always been in love with school, the whole almost homeless thing just threw my first year off.

idk if film school is worth it or i should just stay with the certificate and try to get a low level job in the film industry and work my way up and major in something else in school or not go to school at all. i have no help financially from anyone, the only loans i can take out are from fafsa bc i dont have anyone to sign on other loans for me, i am not even able to get parent plus loan. 

frankly i just want to know what i should do about my education. ive always been smart i just stopped applying myself and i want to get better. idk whats best for me im just feeling stuck and confused",college,i need help deciding what i should do for my education,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/w4ovsw/i_need_help_deciding_what_i_should_do_for_my/,1658448425.0

122,Gullible-Bicycle-683,1658140655,/r/college/comments/w1w408/updatebeen_lying_to_my_parents_and_havent_told/,"Hello friends, I’ve decided it’s time to give y’all and update on the situation. It’s been a little more than a year now and here is what went down. What happened was, the day before graduation we were about to drive to my school to “pick up” my gown. As soon as we were about to leave I told my dad sobbing that I’m not graduating or not going to school. Once that happened there was a lot of crying going on. My mom ended up coming home from work to be in the car as well. I told them I’ve been lying to them for the past couple years and they just couldn’t believe it. It was hard from them to hear those words coming out my mouth. They paid all this and that but it’s was basically all to nothing. My dad said he kinda had a feeling because he never really saw me go on zoom for classes. My parents were heartbroken man. A couple of days past we weren’t really on speaking terms which I understand 100% I was waiting for them to call me to talk. We talked it out and at that time my mom accepted what had happened. I told them that school was just too hard and i was doing compsci only because they wanted me too type of thing. My dad wasn’t really on the same page as my mom yet and still resented me for what I did. I was working at the time and wasn’t able to drive so he drove me to work. One day he just spilt all his anger on my and it fucking sucked dude. Crying in the car in silence till I got dropped off to work and continued crying there. I think he just needed to get that off his chest. Later that night when I got home while I was cooking he apologized to me and we hugged it out. My parents and I talked about the situation again but this time with a clear mind. They became more understanding with what happened and wished that I would’ve told them sooner so they could’ve helped. That is honestly the greatest regret I have in my life right now. If only I told them sooner. They talked to my aunt and uncle about my situation and advised me to try and get reinstated. After their conversation I told myself I wouldn’t ever lie to them like that again. They even threatened me saying “we will kick you out and you’ll be responsible for your life. You wont me able to call me mom or dad anymore “ type of stuff which sucked so much. Especially when they immigrated here to give us a better future ya feel? I ended up enrolling back into a community college once I was in the right headspace to move on with my education. I’m now majoring in Business administration and I’m doing the best I’ve ever done in college with 3.5+ GPA hoping to transfer back to a 4year next year! I have my own car and I’m continuing work while still going to school. Of course my parents will still never fully forgive me for what I did to them but they were able to move on and now fully support me once again for education. I don’t want to get hella cheesy but you really do learn from your mistakes especially if it’s something huge like what we did. In the end of the day college is not a race. As long as you get to the finish line and reach your goal then that’s all that matters. It’s ok to think about your parents but you can’t lie to yourself either. Find your passion or whatever interests you and go for it. I want you to be able to move on accepting what happened because once you do that it’s a huge weight removed from your shoulders. It feels like a fresh start. I hope this was able to help you in any way shape or form. My biggest advice to you is to tell them ASAP. If you keep telling yourself “ I’ll do it when I’m ready” then will you ever really be ready? They will be mad and will be upset but that’s completely understandable. It might take some time but that’s ok. They are your parents. They were your first supporters and they will forever be in your corner. They just want us to succeed in life where they couldn’t. Take your time with healing. Be sure you’re in the right headspace to move on and you’re doing something that you enjoy/interested in. Also, talking to a therapist will be a huge help as well. Holding all that in by yourself takes a huge toll on your mental health. I personally haven’t done it yet and I’ve been feeling pretty down/anxious. At the end of the day, be true to yourself. This is your life and you should live it how you want to. I wish you the best of luck and know that your accomplishment won’t go unnoticed. If you want to know anything else or need someone to talk to then I’m here for you. I’m in your corner now rooting for your success. Take care and brush your hair! You got this friends!

TL;DR
Parents extremely mad &amp; don’t fully forgive me yet. However, I’m doing so much better at life and school. Pls tell parents ASAP if I’m same situation!",college,UPDATE:Been lying to my parents and haven’t told them I dropped out of college.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/w1w408/updatebeen_lying_to_my_parents_and_havent_told/,1658158655.0

She wants to pursue business / management, and has a high degree of probability that she will get admission into an ivy league college. 

She wants to pursue her undergrad and at the same time work in movies. I am all for it if she thinks she can manage the pressure of both. I know there is downtime on the sets but if the series goes into production, I am worried she may have a hard time to manage school as well as production and acting. Even though she can make the call to choose one over the other when the time comes, I am curious if she can manage both - I never studied in the US so my understanding of US education is abysmal at best. The only public examples I see are the likes of Bill Gates or Mark Z who couldn't handle both and dropped out of college. 

My preference is for her to pick a school that is supportive of her other activities and give her some leeway instead of going for the biggest name college she can get into.

First and foremost, I am an arts student in university, but I have majored in science previously; therefor, I was not as experienced in drawing and painting the rest of the class, because I didn't have the chance, the time or the money to join a preparatory school for long before my admission in art school. Ofcourse, my lack of experience was obvious and my proffessor (let's call hime mr K.) immediately picked on it. Ever since, no matter how hard I try, he is always condescending to me and, despite the fact that I have finally reached the same (if not higher, in many cases) level as the rest of the class, he is still treating me in the most unpredictable and unnerving way:

1.  He won't hesitate to give me an earfull in front of the whole class. He makes us showcase our work in front of an audience and if he is not happy with it, he won't hesitate to make us look like fools. In my case, he kept telling me during class that I had worked a lot and that we would see my designs later, but when it came to comparing them with the rest of the class, he made me look like an idiot. He told everyone good words about their works except for me; he pretty much told me that all my designs were useless. Needless to say I left the room banging the door; ever since he has mentioned that he thinks this was a dick move on his part and that he didn't mean to make me give up (my answer was that noone was going to make me give up, I have had worse than him).
2. Whenever I do something right, he belittles me achievement. There is always a ""but"" lurking about. Like, ""your study is good, but you have missed a millimeter of the left foot"". Needless to say, EVERYONE in class misses something here and there, we are just students after all, but when it comes to me he will point out even the tiniest things. He is never so hard on most of the others. The worst to me, is when he comments on my progress. It always goes like this: ""you may not be as sharp as the rest, but you still improve"".
3. He constatly makes condescending remarks on my lack of experience: one of his favorite quotes is ""you lack experience, you are not ready yet"". Once he recovered from covid he said that ""now that I am back, I feel so good that every painting looks nice"" (in the meantime, he was starring at me).
4. He makes remarks on my personality. He once said, in front of my fellow students, that ""OP has a rather peculliar character, she has improved DESPITE her lack of skill"". He often makes remarks on my timid nature, saying that ""I lack energy"", ""I lack emotion"" etc etc. The thing is, I am autistic (he doesn't know) and he has been making remarks about my autistic traits in front of the entire classroom. After one of these incidents he realised that I was furious; I was obviously tearful and I accidentally dropped my coffee on the floor making a mess; he told me to ""please, let it be sweetie"".
5. He makes fun of my background as a scientist. He often uses it as justification that ""I lack the emotional qualities of an artist"" and that I am ""too much of a scientist to be an artist"".
6. During our exams, when the person who was marking our works asked him whether he believed I deserved a higher grade or not, the bastard said ""nah"". This is the second time he interferes with my midterms grade.
7. Sometimes, I have caught him glancing me work, He often comes to my easel, takes my paintbrush and gets so immersed in my work that he will start working on it as if it where his. He has done A MULTITUDE OF TIMES. He spends time showing me things and trading tips with me (even in his condescending way). He sometimes becomes so immeresed in my works that he gives me shoulder pats. He has this ""what a cute little pup"" look on his face AND IT DRIVES ME INSANE. just because I am small looking, this does not make me his pet project!

People, I do not know how to handle him. His attitude has dealt a huge blow on my self esteem. He has made me believe that no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, I always be one step bellow the rest. Whenever I pick up my paintbrush, I can practically hear his voice in my head, telling me to give up.  He has made me cry so many times I have lost count. I am alwas sulky and frowny when he is around, and as a result, a rumour that I am depressed has started around uni (I am not depressed by any means, I am just having a hard time in some classes). It is so hard to be considered ""Second rate"" all the time. Is there anything I can do about it? I don't even know what to think about it some times. I see no reason in his fluctuating attitude!

To be fair, he is an ass in general and many students have left class crying (one nearly beat him up once) but as a fellow student has put it, I am ""eccentric and I demand respect from others"", so...

I’m absolutely terrified to go back because im scared im going to fall into the same dark hole i did early spring. i really do not know what to do. i’m scared i’m going to hate it again and want to leave. what if i go to school and end up hating it again? what if i don’t go back and see all my friends having fun and regret not being there? i’m just embarrassed to have dropped out twice but it’s eating me alive. i’m nervous to talk to my parents about it but my parents luckily are very understanding people. any advice would be great. i also haven’t really thought about it much until recently because i was sure i wanted to go back but i feel like if i was really sure i wouldn’t think twice about it.",college,second thoughts on going back to school,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/vtk5ca/second_thoughts_on_going_back_to_school/,1657222610.0

I've only completed one which i failed because I gave up and stopped caring in the middle of the semester. I have 23 W's under my name and it's just so embarrassing. My parents think I'm in my 2nd year and will graduate soon (most degrees here in Australia are only 3 years), but little do they know that I haven't even ""started"" yet. 

I've tried EVERYTHING. I've done courses in criminology, law, digital design, interior design, architecture, construction management, fine art, digital media, UX/UI design, computer science, language (chinese), english/writing, art history, philosophy, environmental science, meteorology, and probably more that I've forgotten.

Everything seems so discouraging and while I'm always ecstatic and excited to be studying a different major, I always lose interest half-way and wonder why I'm even studying this and I can never imagine myself working in this field. 

It doesn't help that my family and I move countries like every 2 years, which allows me to only studying online and that really limits my options. When I first graduated school, a lot of people told me that it's okay to not know what I want right away and I should try out different things and see what I like. So I spent 2 years doing that, and I still don't know what I want to do with my life. Now what? I'm just as lost, if not, even more lost than 17 year old me. At least then I knew I wanted to do a creative major, maybe something in humanities. But now nothing seems appealing and my strengths and weaknesses are all a blur. There's too many options yet not enough. I'm just so tired and exhausted from all of this and I don't even know how to tell my parents that I've dropped out yet again. I feel like I'm just wasting time and I'm so pressurised by all of this that I can't get my thoughts straight so I'd really, really appreciate it if someone could help guide me in some direction and help me figure my life out.

TDLR; I've tried almost all available majors and still can't find one that I like. I feel like I've wasted 2 years experimenting and I still haven't found an answer.

137,gf20xx,1656101180,/r/college/comments/vjx5y9/not_having_a_summer_job/,"hi, i'm going into my junior year of college this fall. I recently went through a severe mental breakdown in april where i almost dropped out and almost failed my classes...but i didn't. since then I still haven't recovered mentally or physically. My mental health has  been pretty bad the last couple months. I'm going to individual therapy 1x/wk and group therapy 3x/wk and on medications. I am improving a little each week but sometimes I go backwards. I've been dealing with severe anxiety and panic attacks since then, but I've always had really bad anxiety. I'm also dealing with depression, insomnia, OCD, burnout, and an eating disorder. I do live with my parents, so I'm in a safe environment.

I had two summer jobs lined up and ended up having to quit because I was having panic attacks before I even started. So, I don't have a guaranteed 5k I would have from working for the fall since I pay for my own tuition. I've worked every summer since I was 16 and have saved money from before. I have plans loans and scholarships to cover the tuition next year since I won't be working. 

But...I just can't help but feel guilty and ashamed that I'm not working or interning anywhere. I don't want my parents to think I'm taking advantage of them or being lazy. I'm so grateful they're helping and taking care of me, and are supporting me to get better. 

everyone keeps telling me I shouldn't feel bad, even my parents, and that mental health comes first and that my job this summer is to just get better so I can function for school in the fall. been told to rest and recharge because I've ""earned it"" and that my body's telling me to ""slow down"" since I've pushed myself too hard. 

idk...If anyone has any advice, validation, or thoughts, especially not working during summer while in college. I just feel shitty about it.",college,not having a summer job,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/vjx5y9/not_having_a_summer_job/,1656119180.0
138,Narguin2,1656058908,/r/college/comments/vjjhgb/how_to_deal_with_pressure_and_also_get_over_fear/,"I've been feeling more stressed out ever since I entered college. I kind of cruised through high school and didn't really feel a lot of intense pressure from classes except during my junior year cuz of some rlly bad family stuff.

Now that I'm in college, I feel like my world is falling apart every single day and the fear just keeps consuming me. I'm going to be a junior in the fall. I recently changed major paths and went from being a biology major to a stats major. Idk, with biology and my gen ed classes, they were similar to my experience in high school. It was tough and I definitely felt more pressure compared to high school, but things worked out and I never failed a class. Recently, I realized that I don't really love biology and I was only doing it with the hopes of getting into med school, but I dropped those plans because don't wanna spend ~8 more years in school and be hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. I mean I think I'm good at bio and chemistry, but I don't really love it and bio degrees aren't rlly known to get lucrative jobs unless I pursue higher ed. 

So, I switched to stats because I had some interest in it and I could get a lucrative career out of it. The problem is, I have a bad history with math. I always had math teachers that were extremely heavy-handed with their teaching methods and would go out of their way to publicly humiliate lower-performing students in the class. I was only a victim to this humiliation once, but being in such an environment just made me hate math and I guess I have some gaps in my knowledge because of this. I took calc 1 and calc 2 at my university and I just loved the way it was taught. Instead of being graded on just the answer like how it was in HS, I was able to earn partial credit for showing my thought process in addition to the answer. The professors also seemed much kinder and were more detailed in their teaching. I thought that perhaps I could make it in the statistics program.

Now I'm taking calc 3 over the summer and I'm in shambles. It's all online and my professor likes to ask conceptual questions. I understand their importance but I feel so dejected because I haven't yet acquired the mathematical maturity to know how to answer them. I was more used to the computational aspect of math and I just crumble when I'm met with the theory. There are some math symbols I don't recognize and I feel so dumb because it seems like everyone else does. Idk if it's because it's a summer course and I feel super stressed, or maybe it's cuz I'm just bad at math or perhaps it's both, which seems like the likely case. I can't afford to fail this class as I'm entering the major rlly late and the program has a gpa requirement. I can't drop the class, and I'm just scared because I'm a low-income student and I have to worry about the financial aspect of university life. My family is expecting a lot from me and I'm beginning to question my capabilities. I just feel like I'm going down a spiral and I'm crumbling under all the pressure.

Ive never asked for help from my teachers all throughout high school. I managed to figure stuff out on my own or read them off the internet. Maybe some of it stems from my social anxiety, but I know a big part of it is because I don't want to look dumb. My parents always expected me to just ""get things"" and when I would show signs of not understanding something, they would criticize me for being stupid. So far, I've never asked my professors or TAs for help in any of my classes throughout my college career this far. How can I get over this fear of sounding stupid? I think another reason I'm fearful of this is because I have friends who would gossip to me about students in their class who ask ""stupid questions."" They validate my fear that there will be people who think I'm stupid for asking questions and it just makes me feel worse.

Idk if any of this made sense. I'm sorry for all the rambling, but I'm in a high stakes situation and maybe I'm uncovering certain aspects of me that I need to mend and everything in my life is just stressing me out. I would appreciate any advice and first steps to fixing myself. Maybe even some advice on how to excell in calc 3 and ""achieve"" mathematical maturity.""",college,How to deal with pressure and also get over fear of seeming dumb?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/vjjhgb/how_to_deal_with_pressure_and_also_get_over_fear/,1656076908.0

Going into my freshman year of high school, I wanted to be a nurse so bad. I loved the idea of working in a hospital and taking care of people regardless of what they needed. I then met my boyfriend's family who encouraged me to go a different route (MD) which opened me up to the idea. Come junior year of high school I took an AP Psych class and fell in love with the human development section and was fascinated by everything the human body could do and become. Flash forward a couple of years and my dad got diagnosed with type I diabetes. It was hard for my family, but I took initiative to learn a lot about the disease and how I could help my dad cope with it. I enjoyed researching and learning about diabetes, and doing so opened up a new world of internal medicine for me and made me fall even more in love.

Going into college I sought out the road less traveled and decided to go pre-med. A year later I dropped it to pursue a physician assistant program after I graduate with my undergrad degree because I got overwhelmed with the amount of schooling I would have to do if I went to med school. Now that I am in my last year of college I have come to a halt. I don't know what to do in terms of my future. I stay up late thinking about this and these thoughts have completely filled my mind.

If I go the MD route I would have to put my life on pause for practically 10 years to pursue a fellowship in endocrinology. I would also have to spend a lot of money on my education which is another downside.

I guess this is just a cry for help to see the pros and cons of each situation and hear what you all have to say.

I started college back in Fall of 2019 as a biomed major. Did well in my classes. When COVID hit my life completely changed. Spring semester of my Freshman year(January-May of 2020) started off with in person classes then finished off with them all being transitioned into online classes. Im not gonna lie I was really struggling with the transition but thankfully because COVID had just started all my professors had a lot leniency on assignments and tests so I was able to finish out well for my freshman year(with like a 3.5 GPA). Sophomore year starts(Fall of 2020) with my classes still being all online due to COVID and thats when all hell started to break loose. So Fall of 2020 I end up having to take organic chemistry and it went absolutely terrible.


 I just could not concentrate with the online format and was going through some really serious depression over other life circumstances I was dealing with. I ended up withdrawing from the class cause I couldnt handle it. Spring semester of my sophomore year(January 2021- May 2021) I was still in a really bad place. My depression was awful, I tried taking organic chemistry again and failed again at it then had no motivation for the other stem classes I was taking(physics 1) and couldn't stand the online format so I withdrew from all my classes.  After withdrawing from all my classes another crazy thing happened. Around that same time that I was seriously struggling with classes and my life in general, I had started my own online business just for fun as a side hobby. Well January of 2021 after I had withdrawn from all my classes for the spring semester, my online business started blowing up and I was making some decent money. I also had another epiphany that I didn't actually have any interest in going to med school and becoming a doctor and was really just doing it more for the sake of making my parents proud and because I had no idea what other career path to choose.

 During this time, however, my parents didnt know any of this was going on and I just lied every time saying school was going well when in fact it wasn't. The reason why I did this though was because I had an immense amount of pressure on me. I was going to college at an OOS school that my parents were fully paying for and also a bio med major with intentions on going to med school. I couldn't tell my parents because it would be a huge let down for them having dreams of me going to med school as well as how much they had supported me financially for college.


 So from January 2021- August 2021 my online business was going well but then things came crashing down. I had a huge setback in what I was doing which affected my income and for a while I was making barely any money and way less than I was making from January through August(Made about $11k).

 So  around October 2021 I started another  online business venture and it started taking off around January of this year. Around january of this year I also started another onlien business venture(haha ikr I just wanted to make sure I had multiple sources of income since making money online and having an onlline business can be unstable) and that business after 4-5 months of work I put into it started blowing up around may of this year.

 Both of these businesses are currently bringing me income monthly but not enough to fully support myself financially yet on my own so I've still been getting help from my parents who think I've been in college this whole time The thing is I have a plan on what to do with my future. After COVID happening and everything I realized that I am business minded person and should be putting my time and energyg into the business ideas I have and pursue them. Here is my current issue now. I have no idea how to tell my parents. Im expected to graduate May of next year. I've been lying to them about being in classes and my grades this entire them. 

My plan is to tell them by December of this year(because I figure that will give me enough time to have money saved up from my business ventures to fully support myself) if worst comes to worst and they fully stop supporting me financially. If that happens I also plan on getting a part time job working as a door dash delivery driver or something like that which would be able to help support the income I make from my businesses.




 I've gotten myself in a pretty sticky situation here obviously. I started seeing a therapist back in January of this year and have been seeing him since. He knows about my situation but still the thought of me having to tell my parents all this is so scary and stressful and I've been putting off thinking about it but know the clock is ticking and my lies I've built up are about to all come crashing down soon.

141,Sharp_Adeptness_4806,1655766210,/r/college/comments/vgyfx3/family_unsupportive_of_my_decision_to_go_to/,"I am writing this because I know there are people out there that go through a similar situation. I hope that my story can bring you some confidence to continue your journey. I am a first-generation college student currently 24M and have three siblings, 22F, 32M, and 31F. I first started college at 18 and immediately all of my siblings disapproved of my decision. My brother wanted me to become a truck driver, my older sister thought I would not be smart enough, and my younger sister did not believe I could go through with college. I dropped out of high school at 18 and got my GED the same month and enrolled in a medical assistant program, graduated at 19 from the program. When I graduated none of my siblings congratulated me or showed up to my graduation. My mother showed up and was proud, she is a first-generation U.S citizen who raised 4 children on her own. She has always wanted all of her children to get an education. I quickly learned that medical assisting was not my end goal, immediately after my completion I wanted to enroll in a community college to earn a higher degree. My siblings again disapproved and started bullying me out of my mother's home, so I moved out. I lived on my own and worked two full-time jobs and finally at 21 years old said I am going to live my dream regardless of what anyone said. I moved back home and enrolled in a community college to finish my associate's in arts and sciences degree and to complete my pre requisites for dental hygiene. I was bullied out once again and said I will do this. From 21 to 24 years old, I moved around a lot while finishing my degree and prereqs and finally I am where am at today. I finished my degree with honors and got accepted to a bachelor's dental hygiene program that I will start this fall. Very competitive program to get into, as many apply for 2-3 years to get in and I was fortunate enough to get in my first time applying. I am proud of myself. I chose not to walk for my associate's degree because I did not want to become sad over seeing other classmates be cheered on by their entire families, and I would have just my mother in attendance. I do plan to walk for my dental hygiene degree though. I have not been congratulated again by any of my siblings for my graduation and or my acceptance into the dental hygiene program. Throughout all of my years going to college my brother was extremely unsupportive and would often talk badly about school and how I need to work at the local mine where he currently works. He has tried to convince me to drop out of college countless times and I would often ignore him because he was very negative. There were times when school was extremely difficult because I worked 54hrs a week as a CNA and had to do college at the same time, and I would often be told by my siblings to just drop out already or take a year break. I did not listen to any of them. I stopped talking to my sisters because I was too busy and did not have time to be lectured about how college was a waste of time and that I should just work at an auto parts store like their significant others. Nothing wrong with working in the mine or at an auto parts store but that was not my goal. I remember during my two-year break from college I tried to make them ""proud"" of me. I had two jobs and applied to jobs like at home depot and I remember them being supportive of those things. But when it comes to going to college and working and applying to dental hygiene programs they were very negative about it. I love my journey, although it is two years away from being finished officially I am happy I was able to overcome negativity and continue my story. I think back to all the times I could have easily folded and ended this. I think back to the negative comments. It made me a better person, I am happier, and more supportive of all others around me, regardless of their goals. I applied to four dental hygiene programs and knowing how competitive it was I applied to a radiology tech program prior to see if I would be accepted since they are less competitive, I was accepted but turned it down. I remember telling my family this and they all told me how big of a mistake it was, and how I won't get into dental hygiene. I was waitlisted for all the programs I applied to and they would repeat this often. Luckily I was accepted. The reason I shared that little part was just to show that no matter what I did I would never make them ""proud"". So school became less about doing it for my family and more about doing it for me and my future wife and kids. I know they will be proud and I know I will. I guess what I am trying to say from this is whatever your goal is, and if your family or friends are unsupportive, or like in my case just flat out rude and discourage it. Chances are they will never support anything you do, so might as well go for it. So many times I thought about dropping out, or that I wasn't good enough or smart enough. Now I can bring home a degree to my hard-working mother, and tell her it was all worth it.

I have orientation for it next month but it just seems like a bad school in general and for my major (biology) and I know I could get into ones that would suit me better. I don’t mean to sound entitled or egotistical I just put value into my education

So really my main question is if it would be a bad idea to not attend fall 22 and apply to better schools for spring 23? It would essentially be a year wasted but going attending for a semester before transferring out also seems like a waste of financial aid. Maybe I could even return to my cc for fall and take some math classes to prepare for pre calculus?

I started my first term as a freshman at a state university straight out of high school 10 years ago. I got a 0.16 GPA because I struggled with adjusting to the rigor of college classes, and had picked a major that wasn't right for me, which was engineering. I picked engineering because of the pressure to pursue STEM that was pushed in high school. Math and science were my weakest subjects in school, but I still picked engineering anyway because I prioritized what the job market wanted and seeming impressive to others rather than what I was actually good at. Despite struggling with engineering and dreading every major requirement, I still tried to convince myself it was going to work out because I was afraid of switching majors and seeming like a failure.

I was eventually put on academic suspension after failing another engineering course. I didn't try to appeal the decision to suspend me from the university since I knew that I was entirely to blame and had no good reason to fight it. I moved back home with my parents, transferred to a community college, improved my grades, started getting the hang of how college classes worked and got my Associates. At first, I was embarrassed about being at a community college, but I was humbled by the experience. I met some very capable and intelligent people in community college, and they were absolutely capable of getting into a good university if they wanted to.

I switched majors and was then a music major for 2 years. My grades were okay, but I definitely felt like I didn't match up with some of my classmates. I decided not to go through with finishing the music program because I didn't get into my top program of choice and didn't want to settle for a program I wasn't excited about and dropped out of college for 3 years to reevaluate what I wanted.

I eventually decided I wanted to go to art school. Art was something that I was told not to pursue as a career because I was told there was no money to be made in it, and that I would be doomed to poverty for the rest of my life. I knew I wanted to be an artist when I was 14. I was known for being one of the only kids who could draw in school and I loved drawing, but because I was discouraged from pursuing it in favor of getting a ""real job"". I switched my major yet again to art at my new school, and basically started from scratch, starting with first-year courses. I felt like I was finally where I belonged and was a straight-A student for the first time in my life. 

In March, I graduated with a 3.95 GPA Summa Cum Laude with a Bachelors in Art Practice, and just walked the stage last week. It took me 10 years to reach this milestone, but I have no regrets about it, and I'm happy with the major I ended up with.

144,Background-Current20,1655350185,/r/college/comments/vdcfuf/is_it_possible_to_get_into_a_super_prestigious/,"I had a very rough semester mentally at a very good school for engineering during the Spring of 2021, and the college of engineering there kicked me out and put me into the Business program instead. While I battled with taking business courses there over the Fall of 2021 as a sophomore during the summer, I ultimately knew this wasn't my passion, and decided instead to just leave the school to fix my problems and pursue engineering elsewhere. This school wasn't MIT or Stanford, but it was way up there. For sake of privacy I won't say which, but it was on pretty similar standing with like Purdue and Michigan for engineering. 

As for what happened, it was a combination of things. For one, in high school I was bullied a lot, to the point where I completely changed myself for the sake of others, and hid my real identity. While it was fine for a while, it began to eat away at my life, as many of the decisions I made were for my fake identity and not my real self, and it made me feel empty inside.

 Number 2, I was a freshman during the pandemic, and got almost zero social interaction that year, which also did a number on my mental health. Number 3, my girlfriend, who at the time seemed like the only person who still cared about me became distant and eventually broke ties with me, which absolutely shattered my heart and my head. I couldn't go an hour without thinking about her or how worthless I was for losing for the entire semester. 

Lastly, I wanted to do too much. I had always told myself that when I got to college I'd finally be able to start doing all the hobbies I'd always wanted to do and become a jack of all trades. Not only was this mindset foolish as it is impossible to do everything, everyday, for a whole semester (never mind my whole college career!), but it also became a mental weight on me, as I would always walk around campus telling myself I HAD to get all of my hobbies done every day as well as my academics, athletics, and socials. 

The combination of all of these problems and no rest mentally destroyed me, and left me with zero motivation and a mild case of depression, feeling that I didn't know who I was anymore, didn't think anyone cared about me, and couldn't accomplish anything I wanted. 

My terrible second semester dropped my GPA at that university down to around a 2.45, and that is when I was moved to Business and decided ultimately to leave.

I took a year off working a job and moved back home with my family to sort out my problems. I started meeting with a counselor to open up about my problems and have healed so much mentally. I changed my over-ambitiousness and just decided its better to have fun with what's in front of you than trying to do everything all at once, as it kills enjoyment for everything as you are always stressed about completing it all. I have also strengthened my relationship with my family and myself, and have never felt better or more motivated to return to school and earn my engineering degree.

I don't want to say I was a genius in high school, but I worked very hard and ended up with a 4.6 GPA and a 1440 SAT. I feel like I have found my old happy self again, and am willing to work just as hard as I once did, if not harder. 

I plan to go to my local community college for the next 1-2 years and fix my GPA and earn my AS in engineering and then to transfer to a university to work towards earning my Bachelor's degree. 

My question is, am I still eligible to get into top universities? I keep seeing posts like this saying it would be simply impossible to get into MIT or Stanford having had difficulties at a university once already. I know those schools are already hard to get into already, but would it even be possible anymore? What about big state schools that are strong in engineering like Michigan, UVA, or Florida? 

I am so excited to restart my engineering work, and am looking to aim for the moon this time around. I guess I just want to know if its even possible considering my unfortunate circumstances in the past.",college,Is it Possible to get into a super Prestigious University after Dropping out of College Before?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/vdcfuf/is_it_possible_to_get_into_a_super_prestigious/,1655368185.0
145,Relevant-Ad816,1655271022,/r/college/comments/vcn5as/academic_suspension_and_whats_next/,"TW: This talks about mental health, suicide and substance abuse 
This is gonna be a very long post but I’m gonna try to sum it up for anyone. After high school graduation in 2019 I went to community college. I was not ready for college due to low test scores and my learning disabilities plus mental health problems. I did decent at community college and transferred to a local commuter four year in the same campus. It was going good and then Covid hit and I did classes at home. While that happened I went on a new birth control and anti psychotic medication. The combination of those two medications made me super depressed and have heavy periods. Well I decided I didn’t wanna go to the commuter school and I wanted to go to a big university. So I applied to a couple local schools and decided I’ll go to CU Boulder with 35,000 students. I barely knew people there but I joined a sorority and made some other friends through bumble bff. Being away from home, wrong major and other issues caused me to not well in school. On top of that I started drinking heavily to deal with the depression and one night I Od on Benadryl with alcohol. Don’t recommend at all. Anyways my grades were pretty bad and I had Ds and Fs. I was also trying to get into Leeds school of business and I needed to do well in my Econ and stats class. I petition for a late drop so my gpa won’t be a 1.0 and they let me take three withdrawals for the classes I took. I then decided to retake the classes next semester. 

Spring 2021: I had to get surgery so I was home for a few weeks and I had the option to get surgery a day after my final but decided it was a good idea to get it during the school year. After surgery I came back to Boulder and things were tough but getting better. Then March hit and the terrible shooting hit and I fell into a bad depressive episode. I still somehow did decent in my classes and I withdrew from Econ again. I also changed my major my Econ to international affairs which was a bad ideas. I ended with a 2.2 ish gpa and had a cumulative gpa of a 2.5 

Fall 2021: I was hopefully for this semester. I was living in my sorority house, I had a close guy friend at the time and roommate. Well it was my first semester of real college and I let myself get carried away with the fun. I went out often. Then one night I got so drunk that I got a severe concussion. It effected my speech. On top of all of that I hated going to school and my classes, because of the concussion, me losing motivation for school and not getting help I ended to getting a 1.3 gpa for the fall semester. This put me on academic probation. I found out on the day I was getting my medical procedure. A couple weeks later I get a email saying I’m not meeting SAP requirements 

Spring 2022: I was hopeful for this semester. I was taking new classes and I really thought I would enjoy them. However I started the semester very depressed and the guy I liked at the time rejected me. I felt heartbroken because I liked him so much. Going back now I realized a relationship was not gonna work. We had a lot in common but different political parties, goals and me having bpd made the relationship not work. I felt super lonely because the guy that I liked rejected me, I had zero friends. So I decided that I was gonna take my own life because I had nothing to live for and I’ll never have a boyfriend. A week before my suicide attempt I got another concussion from a ladder in my sorority house falling on my head. All my friends that know me will know this story. After the concussion was semi over I decided I would act on my attempt. I did it on Valentine’s Day because I felt unloved. I ended up taking 1000 mg of my migraine medicine. I originally was going to take 2000 mg of that medication but decided against it and that’s what saved me. Once I took the medicine I regret it and didn’t wanna die. Well I ended up having a seizure and went into cardiac arrest in the ambulance. I survived but didn’t remember much. The guy I had a thing with was so sad and worried for me and I knew I definitely hurt him that day. To wrap this up I didn’t do well in school and I got two Ds in my business minor classes and didn’t make a B in my international relations class. I got a 1.7 gpa and my cumulative GPA dropped to a 1.87. I faced academic suspension. After getting on academic suspension I applied back to my old transfer school and I also applied to a Christian College in Arizona. 

Now: I also got an internship and financial advising and I got into those two schools. I change my major to accounting and finance because I found out that I really like math and I like the financial aspect of my majors. I have a supportive boyfriend now, The guy had a Situationship we are very best friends now, I dropped my sorority, going to Vegas with my best friend. 
What I’ve learned from the this experience is that everything happens for a reason. If you’re are facing an academic probation or suspension just know that you are not alone and you will get through it. Learn your mistakes and what to change.

Hello,

I never thought I would make a reddit post asking for advice but here is my situation. I just finished my Sophomore year and got absolutely fucked. My Freshman Year of college I had a 3.8 GPA with 12 Classes ranging from A- to an A+ and about 2 Bs. I transferred to a different school and realized that I wanted to do CS as my Major but I applied to the undecided school rather than the CS school which at the time I didn't mind I just assumed it wouldn't be difficult to apply to the CS School. I was completely wrong. Apparently they only accept about 1-2 students per year who try to do a Inner University Transfer which I quickly found out by many of the students on Campus which to me is completely ridiculous for an Okay college. I decided to completely grind for the year as I applied and this is where my issue came in. When I transferred my GPA completely reset to 0, so for my Fall Semester I took 3 4 credit courses and 1 two credit course. I ended up getting 3 As and a C for one of the four credit courses. This was completely my fault for taking possibly the worst class and professor ever. My GPA as of Fall was a 3.4 which didn't bother me that much. I also forgot to mention but at this point I'm only taking Gen Ed courses and whatever courses I can take that fulfill a CS degree that isn't locked to the CS School.

So Spring I take 3 4 Credit Courses. I end up having to do a Late Withdraw for One of the courses. My Grandpa died at the start of the spring semester, I got Covid, I was dealing with an immense amount of depression, anxiety, and stress throughout this. So why didn't I withdrawal my hardest class before the deadline? Because I completely forgot the deadline date and on top of that I couldn't just Withdraw. I'm poor and these classes cost money and it isn't as simple and just wasting the money I already paid for. I knew I had to Withdraw though as soon as my mother had 2 surgeries and I had to keep driving back home and then back to campus to take care of her. This driving happened at least 10 times during the middle of the semester due to other family issues and the drive back and forth usually takes 6-8 hours. So I asked for a Withdrawal for this one specific course and had to write a reasoning. I basically explained what I just said in 300 words. Stopped going to that class and started focusing on my other two as I assumed I had perfect reasoning. Got denied a few days after the semester ended and ended that course with an F. You can appeal the withdrawal denial which I did as I don't think I was detailed enough so I sent a 3.5k word email being extremely detailed explaining why it was 2 weeks late and what exactly happened, and I ended up having a meeting yesterday which I can admit went poorly, and today I received an Email saying they are going to still deny my request.

So this is why I need advice. The other courses gave me 2 As and I got an F for the course I attempted to Withdrawal. This single handedly dropped my GPA to a 3.4 to a 2.9. I have absolutely no chance of getting into the CS School now nor can I even transfer to a good school now. I also only have 2 Gen Eds left and when applying for classes for next semester about a month ago because I transferred and only 20 of my 33 credits transferred I have an extremely late registration date which caused me to register late and the last two Gen Eds I have are waitlisted by 20 people in front of me. So I can't even technically go to school next semester now because I have no classes to take. So now that I basically can't do anything, I'm heavily considered dropping out. I haven't got my decision yet from the school if I got accepted but there's no need to.

So now I'm considering heavily dropping out of school. This has taken such a toll on me my stress and depression has been at such an all time high but I really think that's the best choice for me rather than spending 2 more years having to pursue a degree I have absolutely no interest in. I wanted to hear from those who also consider dropping out or even have dropped out if in the end it was completely worth it and a good choice you made.",college,Need Advice on Dropping Out,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/vcaffc/need_advice_on_dropping_out/,1655250220.0

And was pretty unhappy my entire adult life. I'd work jobs I hated on and off for money. I've tried to start college a couple times in the past, but they were false starts. I've spent ungodly amounts of time of just doing nothing but living in my small bedroom. From 18 to 26, it was all depression. 

I'm not entirely sure why, but something is different now. I once again returned to school, this time starting in the Spring. Somewhere in the process of paying for classes, mapping out my desired class schedule for the next 2 years, knowing what career I want to pursue, and what university I want to transfer to, something clicked. When Spring started, I began to feel happy about being in school. It's like for the first time I can see a bright future for myself.

I was partially worried that I was just in a honeymoon phase, and that I'd eventually drop out again, because that's what I've done in the past. However, as the semester went on my motivation never dropped. Even when things got hard and stressful, I never had the thought to quit. I finished Spring with an A in all 5 classes.

Currently, my 4 week mini-class just ended (A), and 2 summer classes I'm in started a week ago. The workload has been absolutely overwhelming. And I fell behind pretty hard. This passed week has been *rough*. I honestly thought I was going to start missing assignments, and possibly might even have to drop a class, because it felt like I wasn't going to catch up. I only slept for a few hours last week up to now, but I did manage to get caught up. It's honestly shocking to me. I never grinded for something that wasn't in a video game. This is somewhere old me what have quit in a heartbeat. Yet, I never even considered it.

I have a newfound resolve, and that's a new thing to me. It feels good. I have things I haven't had before. Drive, ambition, motivation, discipline. I feel like I'll do what ever it takes to reach my goal, which is graduating.

Without the structure an IRL environment provides I couldn't apply myself at all, and dropped out. I told myself I'd go back when everything was guaranteed in person again, and I just applied for September and got accepted back into the program.

The problem with my decision is every single person that has graduated said that the actual career is 0% related to anything you take in school for it. It's difficult for me to judge if I hate the career just based on the beginning of the degree. I feel like I'm cheating myself out of my potential by dropping out. On top of this, the way my school functions is the first 2 years of the degree are general and the last 3 are more specific to the field you choose. If I stay in I plan to take computer engineering, but that also makes it so difficult to decide if I like this or not because I haven't even gotten to any material related to what I'm taking it for.

The decision is so difficult for me because I just don't feel like I have any real world passions in terms of career. At least nothing that would make guaranteed good money.

150,Next_Arrow,1655059005,/r/college/comments/vas9x9/financial_advice_from_a_college_bursar/,"Hi guys!

I’m a college bursar at a small, private university in FL. As someone who deals with student accounts on a daily basis, I thought I’d give a bit of advice as it seems that a lot of students I’ve met seem to get themselves into a huge financial mess.

Before we start this off I just want to remind everyone that your admissions counselor is a salesperson. Their whole job is to try to sell you on coming to their university. They will make everything sound simple and sweet because that’s what they get paid for. As lovely as these people can be, don’t trust them! Do outside research on the college you want to attend. Read reviews, the student handbook, policies etc… don’t just fall blindly into a trap!

1. Please please please get your gen-eds somewhere else. At my university classes are $2,600 EACH. DO NOT PAY $2,600 FOR A BASIC COURSE!! PLEASE!!!! Below I’ve listed some alternatives to get your gen-eds out of the way.

A. CLEP

This is an exam that you take for college credit. This exam is accepted by about 3,000 universities in the US. Each university is different about the scores you need to receive credit- so do some research beforehand! I tested out of both English comp 1 &amp; 2 when I took my CLEP exam, saving me lots of time and money. Tests are about $90.00 each. 

If $90.00 for a college course still sounds expensive, check out Modern states. They have a program where you take the exam prep with them (which is free) and then they’ll give you a voucher for your exam (making it free!!!)


B. Sophia, Saylor Academy, Straigherline, etc… 

These all offer low cost college courses. Again, do some research beforehand and make sure the credits will transfer to your university of choice. 

Sophia.org

- It’s basically a monthly membership plan. For $99 a month you can take as many courses as you want. They also offer a free trial. They have lots of partner colleges/colleges that will accept their credits. 

Saylor Academy

- Completely free (except for a $5.00 proctoring fee for each course that requires it.) They are a little more limited with partner universities though. 

Straighterline

- Courses start off at $59.00 each (with a $99.00 monthly membership) and transfer to a decent amount of schools. 

While we’re on this topic, I’d like to mention how much I recommend WGU. You really can’t get a better bang for your buck. WGU is a partner university with all of the low cost course providers above. Also they charge tuition per semester- and you can take as many classes as you’d like during each semester. My best friend got her gen-eds done for under $500.00 through a mix of the programs listed above, finished her degree with WGU and then landed a six figure position in IT straight out of school. Overall she only paid about 6K for her degree! Check out the WGU reddit page for some more stories if you don’t believe me. 

Remember: At the end of the day, employers don’t care about where you get your degree. They just care that you have one. If that means finding a more affordable college to attend- DO IT. I’ve never heard of someone not getting a job simply because of what university they attended. 

c. Community college. 

Community colleges are usually cheaper than other schools. At least get your gen-eds done there and then transfer them to the school of your choice. 

d. Tuition reimbursement. 

Some employers offer tuition reimbursement to  their employees. See if your employer has this program and if you’re eligible! If not, possibly look into switching jobs and get yourself employed with a company that does offer this type of benefit. It could save you a whole lot of money. If you go this route make sure you read the fine print! Lots of times you need to maintain a certain grade to get compensated!!

2. READ EVERYTHING!!!!

I know the admissions process can feel rushed (because your admissions counselors are 100000% being rushed to recruit you).  But please, take your time and read everything that they give you - and most importantly read everything you’re about to sign!! At my university I have lots of students that didn’t realize they signed up for a monthly payment plan because they didn’t read their documents. I have also had students that didn’t read our drop policy and didn’t know that if they dropped a course at a certain point that they would still be obligated to pay for it. Please, please, please, just read everything. It could save you a huge headache in the future. 

3. Avoid the bookstore if you can. 

The bookstore on campus is expensive- and we’re always told to push students to buy from the bookstore because the university gets a percentage of each sale. Don’t listen to us. Try to get books somewhere else. One option is chegg but there are more options out there! Also, check out library genesis. They have some PDF’s of textbooks for free. I used this site when I was in university to get the book for my math class

4. Choose (and use!) your campus resources. 

Use the campus gym, the school printer, free tutoring, busses, school discounts etc... Little costs add up in big ways!! On another note, try to avoid living on campus or buying a meal plan (unless you really think they’ll be beneficial to you!). In most cases I’ve found that both are a pretty big waste of money for most students. 

5. Apply for financial aid.

This is a given, but apply for aid, grants, scholarships, etc… you never know what you’ll get!

151,Blackheartinertia12,1655001347,/r/college/comments/vacgry/dropped_out_and_want_to_go_back_but_unsure_of_how/,"Hopefully I can get some solid advice/answers as I'm confused how to move forward right now. Back in the heart of lockdown in 2020, I dropped out of the university I was attending. Now I didn't ""formally"" drop out (fill out any form..if that's a thing)...I just stopped signing up for classes and attending. For some background, I had attended a community college prior to entering university, and attained my Associate to transfer in Business Administration. I then spent a semester at another community college taking some art classes that were of interest to me, and finally transferred to the uni. Something to note is that I NEVER had any interest in Business Administration, nor do I currently, but as a desperate attempt to win over my parent's approval, I said screw it and chose that path.

Within my second semester, I switched my major to communications...reason being I could no longer STAND telling people what my major was, as it felt like a total sham. Now..I also had no interest in communications, but I couldn't for the life of me figure out what I wanted to do, and some of the other majors that I did have somewhat of an interest in just seemed completely out of reach considering how far along I already was. Something I should also mention is that at this point, I was taking out loans, so that shit was something that stuck in my head while moving forward..all I wanted was to finish and get out, but instead the same shit happened again. I LOATHED telling people what my major was. Something I had noticed was that most people majoring in communication ALSO had no idea what they were doing, and I guess it held that stigma of being a BS degree. As graduation crept closer, I started panicking. I hate being something I'm not, and I ESPECIALLY hate seeing my name anywhere that doesn't feel like a good representation of the person I am...for me the thought of seeing a degree with my name typed out above ""Communication"" scared the living shit out of me. There was also the fact that I had done zero internships as I also had zero interest in the field itself. I do want to say though that there were people in the major that had a clear path in sight and knew their next steps, but altogether, the major was just too vague. Hell, I even remember a professor telling us she had no clue what to do, so she just got a masters and began teaching. Just no clear career path to follow afterwards in my case.

 Then lockdown happened, and I immediately stopped caring. The classes for the major were always very easy and never really taught me anything new..and I knew that..but something about lockdown amplified that and made me realize just how much of a joke the classes were. The money being spent did not at ALL add up to the quality of the classes and the material being taught that I could no longer push out a single assignment. It was really strange honestly, cause like I said, I always knew how bullshit the classes were, but at least I could write the required essays and do all assignments. I struggled and I mean STRUGGLED to get even a single sentence of writing for any assignment, that I just said screw it and stopped attending my classes. Needless to say I pretty much failed all of the classes which ended up becoming NC as a result of lockdown. 

Once I stopped school, I got a full time job at a preschool and enjoyed my time with the kids. It also helped me learn a bit more about myself and where my interests lie....that's not to say that I want to go back to school to get a degree in early childhood education, but it at least opened my eyes to some possibilities. It also made me even MORE aware of the fact that 18 year olds shouldn't just be thrown into college and expected to know what to do. A simple gap year or two REALLY would've opened my eyes, but of course, with strict parents...gap years aren't even a pipe dream. 

Lately I've been REALLY missing school...so much so to the point of daydreaming being in the classroom. What's funny about this is that for YEARS I kept bitching about how much I hated saying I was a ""student"" and that I wanted to be done with it all. Now that some time has passed and I feel more grounded in myself (no longer giving a fuck about what my parents think.....and them somehow no longer caring; telling me to do what I really want) I just really want to be a college student again. I'm still not 100% locked down on what I want to major in, which is why I wouldn't immediately jump back into it, but I want to know if all of my general education units would still be valid if I were to start over at the university level. Honestly, I'm still not sure how I would go about that as I've moved to a different city and have no interest going back to the university I dropped out of. I mean...is it even possible for me apply for a university with a 6 year old transfer degree? I'm just unsure of how all of this works. I live near a nice university and community college, so I even moreso just feel the need to get back into the classroom; this time with complete determination and interest for my education and the field I'm going into. The other issue is how to pay for my education. Financial aid is out of the question, and I'm honestly really scared to take out more loans on top my existing loans. I was lucky to end up on the smaller scale compared to others (15,000) with a monthly repayment of $150. Like, 150 is doable...but what if I need more time to complete classes which results in even MORE loans, and an impossible monthly payment?I'm just confused on how people navigate this. I know a lot of people drop out and go back years later, but how does this work exactly? I don't want to start over at the community college level even though I enjoyed my time MUCH MORE at cc then I did the uni, but can I even apply as a transfer student again? It's the matter of time and money that gets me the most...I deally, I want to go back to school fulltime, dedicated and focused, and get my degree as fast as possible...but what about work and paying rent LOL. It's laughable when I think about it. How does this all work. Any advice would be great. I'd also LOVE to hear from others who have gone through/currently going through the same thing.

I moved to the town where I’d be attending university, got a job working in a nursing home kitchen and worked every day all day instead of enjoying my summer and preparing for school.

And when midterms came around, I wasn’t prepared at all. And I went through a multitude of panic attacks. So. I dropped out of college right after I got my midterm grades during my first semester as a freshman. And proved my entire family was right about me. I was able to withdraw from all but one of my classes. And for the past two years since then, just thinking about school has been hard.

During my senior high school days, I was almost late for submitting applications. While filling out my application for CC, my whole body was shaking with anxiety and thoughts ran through my head as I didn’t know what to do or what to major in or if college is for me. I ended up enrolling as I was afraid to disappoint my parents and feel out of place if I don’t enroll in college.

My major ended up being Pharmacy Technician. I chose this on a mere whim and had no idea I can set my major as “undeclared”.  My anxiety got the best of me and somehow found myself in financial aid though my family has  enough to cover college expenses.

I regretted it almost instantly. I was heavily uninterested in my major. Anything I had to do college related just gave me terrible anxiety. Just recently I dropped a class on the first week as the workload alone made my anxiety scream. 

My fall semester starts around August/September and I don’t want to be in CC anymore. I didn’t follow my ED Plan and only enrolled in 1-3 classes per semester.  I tried to explore my passions for college and nothing came up. 

My financial aid for some reason doesn’t give me any loans or grants, only covering my class fees. 

I’m so scared if I drop out, I’ll have to pay and I feel like I might not have enough money or afraid on what my parents would think of me. 

With that in mind, I’m also heavily scared of how to drop out of CC while in financial aid, I don’t know if I should do a leave of absence or drop out. I don’t even know how to do that as my CC website provides little to no info about it.

I know my parents support me in everything and have never done me wrong. But what would they think if a horrible son like me? A two-faced loser who looks social and funny but in reality, is a scared, anxiety person.

What do I do? Is it truly okay for me to drop out of community college? I don’t even know if I want to come back. I’m scared.

Ever since middle school after I was bullied a lot I promised myself I would turn out better then them in the long run. I wanted to ""prove them wrong"". It turns out that I actually did make that dream come true (on paper).

 You see I am not the brightest individual. In grade school I was in the most basic classes possible. The people I graduated with that had the same classes with me in grade school went for simple jobs like a retail worker. The people that were ""average classes"" went to some post secondary like community College or a trade school. The people who were in the honors classes went to either college out of town or to the military. Those were the people I wanted to be like because they seemed so happy. I also was diagnosed with OCD and ADHD as a young lad.

I did literally exactly what they did. As of now, I am becoming a Junior in college majoring in MIS. This summer I got a professional internship working for a respectful company and finally got what I always wanted. At the moment I was happy that I finally was starting my career goals in life. Today is my second on the job and I already feel missed out of place.

I am working for a manufacturing company and there are a lot of different roles within the company. There are the engineers, business people, IT people, the managers, and the trade people like welders. Today I was task to learn how each station works. I met the welders and for the first time working there I felt comfortable.

Up to that point, the only people I was talking to were the business people. I was always so nervous around them and felt alien. At first I just thought it was because I was an intern but that's not the case. It's just because I can't relate to them. A light bulb came to me and that was I am faking my life.

It's just not here either, it's also in college. As for the last two years in college I never felt any connected to anyone expect for a couple people. 

For people out there reading this, I just want to tell you this. Just because you have an impression career that doesn't mean it makes you happy. I'd say staying true to who you are is more important then to be impressive to others.

As for me, I wish I could go back and tell myself that it's not worth it. I am at a state of life that if I dropped out if college I would be devastated.

Let's talk about me and mechanical engineering, the reason I'm in this department was my dad's opinion. I was quite in to the field of filmmaking back in high school, however my dad didn't want his son to go to movie or literature college and lose the ability to survive in Taiwan with minimum wage, which by studying in engineering department can easily avoid it. (In Asia, we tend to discriminate the literature department and praise the engineering department, especially electrical engineering and computer science due to the huge difference among the wages.)

Actually I had struggled during my freshman and sophomore years. I escaped the academic work by joining the movie club and made a few short film. The making of the first film was fun, but the second, the third... it was not the same anymore, the quality of work dropped, and my creativity burnt out. I just don't want to make film anymore, it made me stressed out, and I gave up any hope of becoming a filmmaker, sealed this idea in the deepest place of my brain.

After the mess in the club, I want to be focus on the pragmatic studying work, instead of my unrealistic stupid filmmaking dream.

Because of my depression, my shrink advise me not to have too heavy load on my studying. However even with the lowest loading, I could have barely survived. Take engineering mathematic I'm studying for example. The only thought when I was studying it was hang myself up. I can't do it, even with maximum focus and energy.

I have discussed with my whole family that I don't want to do mechanical engineering anymore, and they support me whatever I want or not want to study afterwards. The greatest question was I am not interested in any subject anymore. Browsing through every department in my university, none of them arouse my interest, including filmmaking, my once only interest. What made things worst was when I was downloading the form of transforming, a sense of fear emerged, I was fear that going to a different department was like thrown into a jail full of stranger, I will have less contact with my friends in the department that we stayed together for two years.",college,Should I quit mechanical engineering and transfer to another department?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/v3cnyv/should_i_quit_mechanical_engineering_and_transfer/,1654204976.0

I am 22 years old and I just began attending college to earn my associate's degree. Neither of my parents went to college and most people in my family are without a degree as well. My mom never graduated high school and she has always had a very ""do what you want"" attitude towards education (she raised me). Throughout middle school and part of high school, I was an honor roll student with a natural talent for composition. I received awards and did very well with little to no support or encouragement. When I got to high school, I was in a few honors classes, but somewhere along the way, I lost my drive for school. I dropped all of my honors classes and began receiving average grades in average-level courses. I had to work my way through high school to support myself and help my mom with bills. I have always wanted to go to college and make a better life for myself, but I never had the guts to pull the trigger until this year. I am now in the second semester of my A.S degree, and I am completely overwhelmed. I work two jobs so I only take three classes per semester, but I am quickly realizing that I struggle desperately with time management and prioritizing tasks. My main point of frustration is math. I could not test into college algebra when I took the entrance exam so I had to take not one, but TWO supplementary math classes (neither counts for credits toward my degree). I am taking intermediate algebra currently and I am fighting for my damn life. The course is online and I am trying to teach myself, but I can barely comprehend anything above basic mathematics as is. I have started to fall behind on the material due to a combination of lack of understanding and waiting until the last minute to complete assignments- I get literal anxiety every time I sit down to do math homework. I have zero faith in myself. I want to drop out already and I am literally not even through my second semester. When I think of myself as attending college I feel like a fraud. I want to be better and I want to succeed, but when I look in the mirror I see myself as the same poor little girl fighting to keep her head above water. It almost feels like I am doomed to be poor and struggle for the rest of my life. Logically, I know this does not have to be the case, but the feeling of never seeming good enough weighs heavily on me.

STEM, Senior, United States

I went to college right out of high school, and in retrospect it might have been better for me to go into the workforce and gain a ground level understanding on life before higher education. I trudged through most of my undergraduate degree with a lack of motivation, and without a real goal upon completion of my academics that I was truly passionate about. In my last semester (Spring 2020) I dropped out of school largely due to the frustration and stress of the pandemic. The learning experience was not the same online without the in-person communication and engagement. It was very difficult having to do everything on the internet. I didn't feel it was worth the price of tuition.

My grades were not of high standard and it was always something, I personally, was ashamed of. In my first two years I had a difficult time getting accustomed to the environment of higher education. It was very detrimental to my overall GPA. I should've seen this as a reason to leave and come back after mentally maturing. I took a wide range of classes trying to find an area I was interested in but that did not help. I had also held various jobs throughout the years in a wide range of industries and they were eye opening (Always left amicably and with a positive impression). After dropping out of school I enlisted in the national guard. It was something I always wanted to do but never took the leap due to a lack of confidence.

I have since saved up money for living expenses and tuition will not be a problem. I have re-enrolled and qualify for academic bankruptcy which would replace my previous GPA with the GPA earned after my first returning semester. This would allow me to start fresh and keep the completed coursework without  the grades being calculated in to my cumulative GPA. I am highly motivated and eagerly looking forward to the upcoming semester.

I plan to go for a full academic year. I qualify for multiple STEM degrees. I want to show I have got my act together. My goal is to go to graduate school for the field I now have a passion in. Is it a waste of time completing the requirements for all four (biology, chemistry, neuroscience, and mathematics) to prove this, and bolster a resumé? They are all very manageable to do, due to many overlapping requirements and little individually required courses. Will graduate schools take any of this into account for admission and if so will it be positive or negative? Is taking the route of academic bankruptcy a major red flag? I have very good social skills and do well in developing professional relationships.",college,Advice for a Former College Dropout,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/up3gut/advice_for_a_former_college_dropout/,1652499974.0

For the first and third exam I got a B, while the second one I got a 48. Near the end of the semester (actually throughout the whole semester) I was really burnt out from working and school.

I thought that the final exam score will be dropped, and my three tests would be used as my exam average, leaving me with a B in the class. 

Instead, it looked like all four of my exams were kept and I BARELY passed the class with a C (70.42%). I already got accepted to the pharmacy school I wanted and im expected A's and B's in my other classes. Because I passed calculus they will still take the credit.

I withdrew from 8 classes during the spring. Initially because I couldn’t handle being on campus, then I decided to drop my minor, and then I realized I needed to add other courses to remain full time. It was a mess. This was my first year as a transfer student at this school, and combined with my mental health (mainly caused by the wrong medication) I just couldn’t handle the stress and did what I felt was right, I wasn’t in the right state of mind when I made all of those schedule changes, I wasn’t thinking about the consequences. I also changed my major when I transferred, which was an adjustment. 

After I got on the right medication (February 17th, the same week I lost it and dropped everything) things changed drastically. It took some time but by mid-March I felt so much better and I finished the semester out strong with a 3.5 GPA and made the deans list. I had a 2.4 GPA in the fall, so I think this shows how much better I was doing. 

Anyways, I’m just venting, and hoping someone else has experienced something similar. I’m writing a letter explaining what happened, I’m collecting all the documentation from my doctor (I also reached out for a letter from her), and I got in touch with my advisor about signing off on my graduation plan. I feel like I have a strong case, but I’m so nervous and scared to be denied. I was finally excited about learning and I’m really looking forward to going back to campus in the fall, then this happened. 

Do you think I’ll get approved? Any advice? I’ve been crying all day about this. It feels like I was finally getting my life on track, and now I’m terrified for my future. I rely solely on financial aid and my scholarship to get me through college.

Hello all. This is my first time ever making a reddit post but I've been wanting to do this ever since I made this decision months ago. This is going to be super long, so I apologize. Hope you enjoy and resonate with something.

Going into college, I was pretty clueless on where to go and what I wanted to study (like most 17/18 yr olds). I had always valued academics and so did my family, my ACT was a 29 and I had a 4.0, so I knew I was able to get into most schools. I grew up in an extremely boring small town in Ohio and I knew I wanted to go out of state, but that was it. I applied to schools in Florida, Hawaii, Ohio, California, Connecticut, etc. All over the place. I found a university in central Florida, and I was intrigued. Their application was easy, and I got in. The school is known for giving out good financial aid to its students, and this was true. I got a good scholarship with grants to help alleviate the absurd ticket price of tuition and board there. So I decided to say fuck it I choose to go there, without even visiting the campus (I tried several times to see the school, but I was never able to because of conflicting events). Florida; beaches, palm trees, good weather, and it was consistently ranked one of the most beautiful schools in the nation. What could possibly go wrong?

At first I really liked it. My freshman year started Fall 2019. Everything was so new to me, and I had no issues making friends and meeting people. I was adjusting to classes well and really had no issues. Hell, when I went home for breaks I couldn't wait to get back. But as time progressed, I found myself thinking about transferring from time to time. I had told myself that the only school I would ever consider going to in Ohio was Ohio State. I really liked Columbus and I loved being in a city.

Fast forward to the end of freshman year, it was cut short by c\*vid and I was super sad and couldn't wait to get back to school and Florida as a whole. Boy was I wrong. I had a terrible Fall '20 semester. I did great academically but my social life had plummeted and I got really depressed. I would leave to go to class, come back to my apartment and see my roommate, but that was pretty much it. I had other close friends I would hang out with, and I went to the gym frequently, but it was overall a terrible semester, mostly due to the college making terrible decisions navigating through the pandemic. I felt so alone all the time. I felt like I never met anyone new and doing anything I enjoyed was hard to come by. So my thoughts of transferring started to increase a lot.

The next semester (Spring '21) went much better. Things were more normal and I met a lot more people, one of them becoming a best friend to me. I even met a girl halfway through the semester and we really hit it off. I wasn't looking for a girlfriend at the time, but I could tell she was worth it, we had a bunch of things in common, and we meshed super well. I had applied to some schools to transfer in the fall, but my advisor and close family advised against it because I was already half way done. So I decided to stick it out and stay another semester.

Fall '21 semester was interesting. Things with my girlfriend were going so great, classes were going good, I had good friends, but progressively my mental health began to drop. Going to a small university in Florida where the general popularity of undergrads were Greek Life or athletes, I felt insignificant and like I did not matter being a regular student. A lot of my friends were athletes (including my girlfriend) but I still felt like I didn't belong. I never really found a group of friends with similar interests and it honestly sucked. I would go home and visit my family and friends, and every time my breaks ended I did not want to go back to Florida. Eventually it got to a point where I broke down to my girlfriend midway through the semester and told her I didn't know how much longer I could stay at the school. It took a lot of courage and I did not know how to tell her. The point is, I was not happy there no matter how hard I tried. All I did was think about how I didn't belong there and that I wished I transferred somewhere else. I was able to recover a bit mentally, get through finals and everything, and flew back home to Ohio for winter break.

I had an incredible winter break back home. I spent a lot of time with my OSU friends and my friend group I usually hung out with, along with my family too. I DREADED going back, and it seemed time was just melting away. A few days before I was supposed to fly back home, I broke down completely to my mom. I didn't know what to do, and I was running out of time to think about my options. I knew that if I did another semester at my school there would have been no point to transfer for my senior year. I would practically be almost done. So I ran the idea of taking the semester off by her and I couldn't stop thinking about it. Taking the semester off would give me ample time to figure out what I wanted to do. I called my girlfriend that night and told her that I was considering taking the semester off, and we couldn't stop crying. She told me she didn't want me to leave her. I was still really on the fence about things.

I was a mess. My dad dropped me off at the airport and I hugged him for the longest time and cried to him telling him I didn't want to leave. The entire time on the flight I remember thinking how if the plane were to crash at that moment, I would not have cared. I ubered back to my apartment from the airport, and went straight to my bed. I didn't eat, and I couldn't get myself to get out of bed. It was like this for a few days. I was running out of time. The semester was starting soon and in order to get a full refund on tuition and everything I needed to decide really fucking quickly. I talked to my parents and older sister on the phone. I sobbed in front of my girlfriend as I talked with her about things. I loved my girlfriend so fucking much but I knew I had to leave. I knew if I had stayed for this semester, I would have only been staying because I didn't want to leave her, and I felt like that was not fair for myself and well being. I knew I had to do this for **myself**. **I knew it was best for my situation and I didn't see the point of me spending thousands of dollars in tuition at this school again if I hated being there.** I went through with withdrawing from the school, packed everything in my car, and drove home to Ohio.

That is the story of me taking the semester off. It was the hardest decision I've ever made and man, it's been a rollercoaster the past four months. I've dealt with so many feelings. Some days I have felt that I have made the right decision for myself and other days I feel like a i'm a fucking idiot. Many times I have thought to myself ""You were so close to being done there, you couldn't stick it out for three more semesters?"" My girlfriend and I tried to do long distance, but we did not realize how difficult it would become. A lot happened the past four months. We got into a lot of disagreements. I even visited her for a week during her spring break and it was amazing to see her. She ended up breaking up with me a week and a half ago and I can't help but to feel at fault. I know this would not have happened if I had not have left. Things were so amazing with her but I ruined it because I had to leave. I took a big risk making this decision for myself and this I guess this was a repercussion of that decision.

**At the end of the day, you gotta do what's best for yourself and your well being.** I knew I was not okay mentally and I made a big change. It's been really hard and I've been dragged through the mud the past two weeks. I am set to transfer to Ohio State in the fall to finish my last year. I know things will get better soon, It's just been tough seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I've been through a lot over the past four months.

That is almost everything. Or at least the best possible way I could say things to an audience who has no context of my life. I cried typing this and put a lot effort into it. Anyone who takes the time out of their day to read this, just know I am so appreciative of you hearing me out.

I couldn’t even get my work and do it at the hospital bc i was in the ICU and was to sick plus they wouldnt allow it at my school bc for obvious reasons not wanting to give it to someone else. My school only allows 6 excused absences and 6 unexcused absences so obviously i was fucked. Due to attendance and like 2 of my classes that i already didn’t have the best grades in.

Honestly, I know it's the best choice for me right now, and I stand only to gain from it. It's a full ride at a great university. But I'd be lying through my teeth if I said I wasn't afraid of actually doing it. When I dropped out, I just thought maybe college wasn't for me. It made me feel debilitated, weak, and depressed, to the point where by the time I left, I hadn't gone out of my dorm room for months, aside from quick trips to a campus shop to get ramen and soda. But six years is a long time, and enough time for me to realize it wasn't college that was the problem. It was me. And I've spent the better part of the last two years REALLY getting stable and ready to return. I had a full ride scholarship, and this is the last year I'm eligible to get it back and really give it my all. So with the help of a supportive family member, I've taken steps to do it. And my odds of readmittance and getting my scholarship back are really in my favor.   


The thing terrifying me most, though, is that this scholarship requires me to live on campus (which I'd have to do anyway as the school is 2.5 hours away from my hometown). And being a freshman still credit wise, it requires me to live in a dormitory hall. I just can't help but feel too old, you know? And ultimately, I won't let that feeling stop me from going, but there's a huge anxiety about it. I guess my question is if it's weird? If I really am too old to be a freshman in the dorms? Again, doing it either way, because I'd be a fool to squander a full ride all over again, but I guess I just needed others to confirm or calm my anxieties about it?  


And if anyone has any advice for making friends in that scenario, since I'll be away from my regular friends and family back home, and how to adjust and make sure I succeed in getting a degree this time, I'm fully happy to take it in!",college,"25 years old, returning to college, will be living on campus and terrified!",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/uh8ffq/25_years_old_returning_to_college_will_be_living/,1651571189.0

185,ActualFaithlessness0,1651380836,/r/college/comments/ufse6j/advice_for_someone_returning_to_campus_after_a/,"I went on a leave of absence after the Spring 2020 semester, when I was in my second year. My first two years were really difficult bc of undiagnosed mental illnesses and interpersonal problems. I failed two courses in Spring 2019 and was on academic probation for the fall, managed to get a 4.0 for Fall 2019 despite my interpersonal issues at that time (I basically withdrew from the social scene entirely out of fear of the people involved), but had a breakdown at the beginning of Spring 2020 (in part because I was cut off from the social scene) and began focusing on getting help. My academics suffered as I was prioritizing my mental health, and then of course, COVID happened. I didn't attend any of my online courses, just took the exams, but then I lost a close relative to the virus during finals and wasn't even showing up for exams. I failed 4 of my 5 classes for the Spring 2020 and went on leave because a) I was probably going to be ""dropped"" from the rolls, which meant I would have been forced to take a year off anyway and b) even if I managed by some miracle to not be ""dropped"", I knew that taking online courses while on academic probation was going to be near impossible. I was initially supposed to return in Fall 2021, but I was nowhere near ready to go back so I requested an extension when it was time to reapply and was granted it.

I reapplied to return in Fall 2022 last month and was ""conditionally"" approved to return. I'm back in the system as a student and just submitted my requested courses for next semester. I still have to work out housing and dining plans, and I haven't received my financial aid statement yet (submitted everything before the deadline), but barring anything catastrophic I'll be going back this fall.

I'm technically considered a sophomore because I've only received credit for 11 courses due to all the withdrawals and failures, but my plan is to graduate in Spring 2024 (because I can only receive financial aid for 8 semesters, so I'll have to take a more intense course load). I'll be on academic probation for Fall 2022, obviously. I was originally part of the class of 2022, which means that receiving messages about senior events these past few weeks and months has been really painful, but that means that most of the people I started school with *should* no longer be there when I return. However, many students took leaves because of COVID, so there will peobably be a few familiar faces in the same boat as me. Of the people I was having issues with, two of them are supposed to graduate this semester (last I checked) but one of them went on leave before COVID happened so he's supposedly graduating in 2023 (last I checked; I obviously no longer have contact with these people). I'm honestly still afraid of  returning if he's there, especially since he probably thinks that he successfully ran me off of campus and will be surprised and angry if/when he finds out I'm back. There's also the mere fact that I'll be trying to socialize with new people who are younger than me (I'll be 22 when I return and 24 when I graduate). I really don't want to hide in my apartment whenever I'm not in class like I was before, but if I had trouble socializing the first time I know it's going to be even harder now.

Anyway, I was hoping that someone else on this sub has been through a similar situation and has any advice (academic or social) for me, or even just a success story of returning from a leave of absence.",college,Advice for someone returning to campus after a leave of absence,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ufse6j/advice_for_someone_returning_to_campus_after_a/,1651398836.0

I have been having to pay out of pocket for tuition, so in fall of 2021 I only registered for 1 class because that’s all I could afford.

I will be submitting an appeal with the school but it looks like if it is approved, I will be placed on academic probation despite my 3.9 GPA.

I never dropped the classes on my last semester in school, so I owe the school money before I can ever enroll again. 

Easy way around that, I just went to a different school. However THIS IS THE ISSUE. I enrolled in some classes(3 I believe) &amp; previous school experience - did not allow me to enroll in a class if I haven’t paid off/received financial aid NOR if I hadnt had an advisor meeting to ensure I’m not taking classes I don’t need. I would have gotten dropped or blocked from enrolling. 

This new school was slick, and allowed enrollment without advisement /guaranteed financial aid. AND without paying the application fee which was a hold I had. 

I dropped the classes( I got into an accident the week I was starting and wasn’t able to make it nor was it on my mind ) and now they’re sending me letter that I owe $800 for the classes I never even showed up. Mind you, I enrolled in them I believe 2-3 days into them having already started and dropped them one day past the “drop without penalty” date. 

Now I know legally, I am in the wrong because there is a date to drop and I was uninformed, and of course taken advantage of with my lack of knowledge. But 

My question overall is will they actually send the debt to a collection agency ? Do most schools do that ? Because my original school never harassed me about repayment like this second school is.

atrocities that are just too much to bear because the teachers gave us primary documents most of

the time, and then made us write essays on the stuff. so we had to repeat everything back to them.

started and I regret not doing that too. It's a college program on the evils of humankind. I was

(Background: undergraduate finishing up Freshman year, double majoring in English/Creative Writing and French. The honors track at my university is two years long and involves 3 honors classes/trimester plus an additional, non-honors class of your choosing (that additional class is going towards French). There is no thesis required in the program—you can choose to write one later, once outside the honors program.)

PROS: 

* Program Benefits
   * honors makes it incredibly easy for English/history/philosophy majors to double major (though my goal is not necessarily to run speeding through my English major)
   * priority registration for all undergraduate classes
   * good title for a resume
   * seminar-style classes and oral exams with professors each trimester improve spoken skills
   * the program director routinely states how many honors students go on to grad school or get grants/fellowships
      * I plan to apply for the Fulbright and later grad school myself, so I feel the honors title would be beneficial in my applications
   * well-rounded, liberal arts education (I've learned a good deal so far)
* Peers/Professors
   * I get to take the same courses with my 'honors cohort' and I like many of them (among them are two close friends)
   * professors are almost always amazing and form personal connections with the class
* Rigorous Program
   * Because my school isn't especially prestigious (and freshman/sophomore courses here are known to be blow-off classes with students and professors who don't seem to care), honors like what I expected a college environment to be (but my expectations could be flawed).
   * As someone who put a large part of their identity into academics (for better or worse), it feels good to finish challenging courses and imagine the ways they're benefiting me
* Personal Aspect
   * I fought my way into this program well after the initial application deadline (I received a scholarship that changed my final college decision). It would be hard for this not to feel like a personal failure/embarrassment if I dropped out a year after fighting my way in.
   * Not to mention, I'm basically halfway through the program. Would that be a year wasted?
   * Isn't the purpose of college to challenge you? The people in my program generally say the work doesn't get easier, but you get better accustomed to it. 

CONS: 

* Workload (a given)
   * Four classes/trimester instead of the usual three (my university is on the trimester system, so three classes is normal and four is considered ""maxed-out"")
   * Overwhelming readings (anywhere from 75 to 200 pgs/day, four days/week)
      * leaves me drained but satisfied if I finish, feeling insufficient and silent in seminar if I don't
      * granted, almost everyone else in the program complains of the same
   * I feel that I have less energy to give to each class (and I usually blow off my non-honors French course almost entirely while focusing on honors, which is sad because I really enjoy French and want to improve)
   * I feel that I'm learning less with each trimester as my energy wanes
* Lack of Interest (sometimes)
   * Of the three honors classes every trimester, one of them is literature (which I'm very interested in). The other two are usually history, sometimes science or philosophy, which hardly interest me at all when stress is high.
   * Because of feeling overwhelmed, I often lose interest even in the literature course, merely focusing on only finishing my assignments as they arise. 
   * **Though Creative Writing is one of my majors, with honors and French, I won't be able to take a single CW class until junior year (half of my undergrad spent** ***not*** **writing creatively, per-se)**
* Personal Passions and Mental Health
   * I feel that I have two options weekly: 
      * 1) slack off in my classes and have more time for writing prose, reading, exercise, practicing piano, mental health days, etc.
      * 2) I commit to my classes, participate well in seminar, feel that I am a ""good student,"" and spend all afternoon after my classes in a library study room until it's time to eat/sleep. Some rest on the weekends. (While I realize that's what college is for many people, I'm a lib-arts major. I expect a low to mediocre income after college, which I'm content with because I will graduate sans loans having studied what I wanted. But sometimes it's discouraging to work my ass off like a STEM student but without the end goal of law/med-school and a substantial income.)
   * Sacrifices
      * I no longer exercise routinely
      * Writing and reading, two of the most important things in the world to me, now become very difficult outside of class and I've produced almost no personal work all year
      * This entire year, there's been this general feeling being out of control (school-life balance, exercise/diet, substance abuse, etc.) and much of that is related to academic stress. 
   * Constant stress environment among my peers is often discouraging/annoying (even simple assignments start sounding impossible)
   * I feel that every three to four weeks, I have a bit of a breakdown when I try (again) to complete all my coursework and then fall short, making me question my capabilities and fall behind in class again
   * I see others having what appears like a healthy school-life balance outside honors (though I do work harder in school than many students here, who apply minimal effort to begin with)
* No Final Thesis
   * I heard this is the primary benefit of any honors program in regards to grad school (i.e. graduate programs don't really care if a student is honors or not, though do like to see an undergraduate thesis, which many honors programs include). My honors program includes no final thesis, though the general English major offers the option to write one senior year.

TL;DR: I'm a freshman in a two-year honors program that exhausts me but comes with a lot of benefits. It keeps me academically challenged and primed for grad-school/fellowships but leaves me little time for my personal passions or to focus on my major until junior year. Should I drop and savor a slower-paced academic life, or bear with it one more year knowing the benefits. Any opinions are welcome. I'm just exhausted and need secondary opinions beyond my honors advisors.",college,Help!

So I feel like I don’t have a lot of information about how colleges work and how to navigate them to give myself the best chance to succeed and transfer into a good institution for my bachelors and beyond. My dad has a bs in aeronautical science and my mom went to college but never achieved a degree. Unlike others in my family, I dropped out of high school in junior year. I was an all A’s honor student, but couldn’t adjust to online school well and had trouble with family and mental health. I got my GED the month after I dropped out and then took about a year off to work before going back to school. I went to therapy and tried to work towards having more of a direction in terms of what I wanted out of college by researching careers, schools, exc. I moved a few hours away from my family to where my friend lived and started going to college there in January. I was planning on staying at this college for the next 2 years before transferring to a 4 year to obtain my bachelors. However, I just haven’t been having any luck putting down roots there. Rent is super high and has required me to dig into my savings a lot, it’s been difficult to find a job despite how many people seem to be hiring, my willingness to work, and my open availability. I’ve got a job now, but it’s minimum wage and I have to shell out 1,500 a month on rent alone. Finding a roommate there who isn’t a crazy person hasnt been going well. I’ve been looking since February everyday. I’ve gotten so much interest but no follow through. When I originally moved there I moved in with an older woman who sexually harassed me and associated with very dangerous people. I did a very thorough background check on her prior to moving but just couldn’t have known. I had to move out after only a week and was homeless for a month. I haven’t been able to make any friends there and my best friend is moving away. My grandfather recently just died and my depression been so bad. I reevaluated my priorities. While my relationship with my family isn’t wonderful, I love my mom and grandparents and my mom really supports me in school and trying to improve my mental health. She doesn’t shame me and really tries to understand and suggested I start taking medication for my depression and chronic pain problems and has been hugely helpful through all my health scares and doctors appointments this year. I miss my friends, I miss the beach, I miss my dog, Im not excited to leave and go back to college anymore. I know I won’t be able to work as much as I need to to afford rent and do a full load of classes, I struggled with only 2 classes this semester and now I won’t even have my best friend to hang out with every day. I don’t regret moving, i’ve had many good memories here and learned a lot despite all the hardship, but I can’t keep this up. My mom thinks it’ll look better to stay for another semester and to finish out my lease until January. I’m clearly willing to get through a lot and put up with a lot when I believe I need to or that it’s worth it, I was willing to stick out homelessness to not have to drop my classes, but this just doesn’t seem worth it. I want to do a lease takeover or sublet my apartment from when I plan to move out at the end of June to the end of January. The cost of living is a lot lower and it’s so much easier to get a well paying job there. I loved working at my cafe job on the beach. So, would it look bad/very negatively impact my ability to get an apartment/transfer to a good school to transfer after this semester instead of after next semester?

Some context: this was due to an undiagnosed medical condition that had progressively been getting worse. I’m now on proper treatment and am already doing much better this semester. Prior to last semester, I had a near 4.0 GPA and of all the classes I did fail last semester, none were from my majors (I was able to withdraw from the classes in my major in time to prevent this but not able to withdraw from other classes as I needed to retain a full-time student status, otherwise I could have lost my financial aid package, which I couldn’t risk). 

Regardless, I am now left in a weird position where there is now a significant disconnect between my GPA and my intellectual capabilities, as well as my interest in my studies. Since your transcript is one of the first things most professors will ask to see if you want to do research with them, I’m pretty much screwed. So I’m wondering if there’s anything I can do to increase my chances of getting research positions for next year. 

I do have some prior research experience. I did research with two professors, one was very short and I didn’t really do much to be honest. The other I quit halfway because I was struggling last semester. At the time, I didn’t know it was because of my condition(s) and just told the advising professor that I was struggling in school, so that didn’t leave a good impression. Moreover, there was this one professor who offered me a role in her research group last year but I turned it down because I had agreed to join the other research group that I left halfway. I suppose the first logical step would be to reach out to these professors, hoping they don’t ask for an updated transcript. Anything else I could do though?

P.s. I’m gonna need a fifth year because of my screw-up, so I suppose I will still have time to do research even if I don’t find a position next semester.

211,Neopint15,1649320051,/r/college/comments/ty8f72/how_should_i_approach_my_professor_about_this/,"Hello everyone, 

First off, I apologize for the lengthy post. I felt it necessary to give background on this issue. I really really appreciate everyone who reads it and gives me advice on the matter. Please skip to the bottom, if you don’t want to read it all though! 

This semester at my college, I signed up for a experiential learning opportunity, where we are placed in a practicum and then connect that experience back into the class teachings (I learned about this afterwards). Before the semester started, we were sent various options by the coordinator, who was supposed to take a look at our transcripts and interests. I was very clear that mine were still science related, but the coordinator continuously suggested a marketing position. After a while if talking, she sent me a few research opportunities, which I liked. Unfortunately, the interviews available were only during my final exam times… the coordinator said that they were also doing interviews the first week of January. However, in January, she informed me that my research interests were taken and again suggested that I interview for the marketing position at least to see what it is about. Pressed for options and wanting to take part in the experience, I agreed. 

I have a background in science, but for reasons unrelated to this post, I went back to school last year under a business degree (the university would not allow me to take another degree similar to science). My main interests were to get some business related experience, while also learning more about research (so I continued to take science courses in between my business courses). However, I have only ever taken one introductory marketing course as it was not my focus. 

After the interview, I again expressed to the coordinator my concerns about my very limited knowledge in marketing. I was assured that there would be a “ton of support” and that I would have a lot of help along the way. She also said it was very similar to research. Given guidance, I felt I’d be okay; however, I came to find out that the “guidance” was non-existent and the help was on the basis of myself reaching out to various professionals at the university - most who were too busy to meet. I was unable to meet with anyone until the middle of February (1.5/3 months into my project) and they were not a marketing professional but did give me insight on the business. My project mentor also had no clue about marketing and was difficult to meet. Everything was also remote and I was the only one in the class with a business type practicum (everyone else had researcher type positions), so I found it to be a very isolating and stressful experience. 

Due to these limitations, I have found myself aimless about my project objectives and slow to progress. I also found it extremely difficult to draw back to my learnings since I hadn’t much of a background into marketing. I feel I have done very little in my project compared to my peers. We are not marked on our project itself, but we are marked on our reflections about the project. 

As I draft up my final reflection, I am realizing that my project progress did not reflect the course’s materials (based on the concept of “community”) very well. I worry that my professor will think I am incompetent and lazy, despite me having lost a ton of sleep and time over trying to navigate this project with limited resources. I worry this may reflect my mark. 

I have dropped hints about my limited knowledge, in the past. My professor knows that I have only an introductory marketing class, but she doesn’t know the conditions of why I accepted the offer despite it. I feel the fact that I was expecting support and didn’t get it is why I have not been able to thoroughly make connections in the class and have been behind. 

Should I email her and respectfully explain my circumstances more thoroughly? I don’t want to sound like I’m whining, but this course has quite frankly, taken me three times as long as it should have due to all my trouble shooting and I’ll be absolutely hurt if I end up getting a bad mark despite my efforts in an adverse situation. 

I was thinking of sending Something like:

 “I was hesitant to bring this up, but after writing my final reflection, I thought it may be best too… while I learned a lot in this role, I quite honestly do not feel it was the best fit for me due to my limited knowledge in marketing. I was initially hesitant to take the role due to this but was assured there would be lots of support; however, the support took much longer to reach out too and was far more limited than I had expected. I felt I really struggled drawing connections and moving forward in my project because of this, although I really gave it my best efforts. It has been an extremely educational opportunity and I have learned a lot; however, I feel my reflection(s) have not been able to go in depth because I do not have the background knowledge to fully understand my role as a marketing strategist”


In short: was matched in an unsuitable practicum, but I tried really hard and did what I could. Want to send my prof an email to let her know the full circumstances.

i was only taking 2-3 classes a semester, and i don't remember a damn thing from any of the three semesters, so i don't think picking up where i left off or fighting for whatever credits i did have is going to be worth it. i'd rather retake the classes. i've never taken the SAT or ACT, i feel that i still need a score from either one. 

personally i'd love to forget that whole community college experience ever happened at all. and i'd like to go to a college or university full time. i've talked this over with my employer and they're willing to set me up with a remote part time position that would follow my school hours. 

i'm looking into trying to get into the schools that i wanted to when i was in HS before i gave up, namely Stevens and NJIT. 

NJIT had a transfer program for my community college, but my advisors seemed to have no knowledge of how it worked or what i was trying to achieve. I was a bit confused too since everywhere i looked i seemed to get conflicting results. i still am confused to this day as to how the transfer program works.

A few moments ago, my mom asked me what's the plan with the dogs, as I'm about to go off to college (out of state). I told her I would take my dog (I'll name him Daniel) with me, because I know she's trying everything her power for me to not go to college out of state. Then she said, I should put her dog (we'll name him Mark) up for sale. Mind you, we've had Daniel for 6 years and Mark for 4 years (rescued Daniel at 2 months and my mom bought Mark for $2800 at 2 months), so I see them like my kids. Anyways, I told her I would take Mark too.  

But lets be real... 2 dogs freshman year as an athlete who also wants to double major in Neuroscience  &amp; Chemistry and have a minor in Greek, that's probably as unrealistic as it gets. Even, if I just stick to one major (Neuroscience), I'd still be an athlete, and then 4 years later, I'd be in med school (God-willing).

I'm truly considering, not going to college at all. I'm furious and mad. I've wanted to be a Neurosurgeon for as long as I can remember. I graduated early (2021, but took a gap year) and was still top of the class. Voted most likely to succeed, most athletic, blah blah blah. And all of that is about to go down the drain.

It was very hard to get into this school, and being accepted felt like such an honor. All I have wanted to for most of my life was music. Unfortunately, school got moved online due to covid. Online school was so bad, it made me very lazy and unmotivated, because it was so hard to sing for my teachers through zoom. I still was excited to learn and grow, though. Second semester was in person, but covid protocols were so strict, we didn't have roommates, we weren't allowed to congregate, we had to eat our meals in our rooms, and we still had almost all of our classes (except ensemble and voice lessons) online. We broke the rules a little bit, but it was extremely isolating. I did what I could, and managed to make friends with the few freshmen who were on campus (again, tricky because the music school is already verrrryyyy small, and numbers were even lower as not everyone came back to campus), and I even joined a sorority with the university. I finally started to feel at home, and just as I finally settled into a rhythm, and accepted my voice and found motivation that I thought I had lost, I went to one of the parties off campus. At this party I was r*ped. It destroyed my will. I went alone, and the people I thought were my friends didn't believe me. I felt like I was trapped in my body and mind. I still loved the city, and didn't want to go home, but the school was making me lose my mind. After this, singing became such a difficult thing for me, and performing for others was even worse. Sophomore fall was awful. I was dating this guy, and he ended things with me after I opened up about being r*ped. He said it was too much for him to deal with, and I really get it, but it hurt so bad. I lost interest in everything, and now singing, doing schoolwork, doing anything feels like a chore. The only thing I like to do is spend time with my sorority sisters, but even that is hard, because the music campus is 20 minutes away from the university. I don't have any friends at the music school, because I stopped hanging out with the people I was friends with in freshman spring, and they seem to be everywhere, as do my r*pists (M 21, F21) and their friends. I am constantly avoiding them, and constantly on edge whenever I go in public. I can't tell if I hate music or if it is just my personal amd social life, and I don't want to leave this school for those reasons, because it is such an honor to be here, I worked so hard to get here, and I have spent so much money to be here. Also, literally nothing interests me. Nearly all my life, music has been my dream, and now all of the sudden it isn't, and I don't know what else to do, but the idea of singing makes me want to scream, and the idea of performing makes me want to shrivel up and die. But what else would I do? I get the sneaking suspicion that if I dropped out, I would waste the rest of my life. But I want to do something with my life, I want to do something that fulfills me, but nothing makes me feel anything, it all just feels like such a chore. All I like doing is being outside.

 In 2012 when I started community college I did so out of pressure from my parents and from teachers. I had no idea what I wanted to study. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. But I loved learning. I like learning . Except, my school work faltered. I procrastinated. I fucked around. I withdrew like a mad man. I failed even more. (I withdrew//failed several classes three times which puts me in a situation where I can't take them again unless I petition.) And I should have dropped out a long time ago, I know. A mixture of liking the school environment, wanting to get away from my family, having something to do, having the ever present anxiety that without school I was nothing kept me going back. At some point I transferred from one community college to another. And then I stopped going last year.

 I picked up and extra job, worked. Realized I did not want to slave away in retail forever (this past holiday season really drove me down a deep, dark, hole). In the past few months it's like I've done a complete 180. That depression fog has lifted for the most part (after a decade I'm finally starting to feel ""normal"")! I've been working on not procrastinating, training my ability to sit and work on a single task, just turning my life around.  I also realized I have a deep interest in receiving a global studies degree and I want to go back to school. 

 I know I have to talk to my counselor and make a plan.  Probably get officially diagnosed and treated.  I looked at my GPA. It's standing at a solid 2.0 with way too many f's, d's and withdrawals as well. Way too many ""irrelevant"" classes. I just want to know if ya'll have ever gone through something similar and ""recovered"" from almost a decade of bad grades/bad choices?  And is it worth it?

218,False-Fisherman,1648611445,/r/college/comments/trxecn/i_just_flunked_out_of_college_how_can_i_make_a/," Hi all. I started my college career as a computer science major at the University of Utah in Fall 2020, with mostly remote classes and professors being much more lenient with grades than usual. I excelled at first, making the Dean's list my first semester, but that was mostly due to being able to put in little to no effort and still getting great grades. Fall 2021, however, my college went fully in-person and, not being prepared for the difficulty/workload to increase drastically, I struggled. I also switched my major to Math midway through the semester because I had been slowly realizing for the last year that I hated computer science and would rather pursue something I actually enjoyed.

I effectively lost my scholarship (effective Fall 2022) and ended up failing three computer science classes in one semester, so in hopes of transferring to a more affordable school, I decided to retake all my failed classes again this semester to salvage my absolutely tanked GPA. I ended up struggling again and was not going to pass a single class again, so I dropped out while I still had time to get a refund on tuition.

Right now I'm working and living on my own but I still have a dream of going back to school, this time in a major I actually care about and am good at (Math or Philosophy) and hopefully at a school that better fits me (Lewis &amp; Clark College looks perfect for me in terms of fit and has an 80% acceptance rate). **How do I make a roadmap to get into another school and finish a degree?

This was around 2020-2021 I applied for a math class and they said I had to take the pre-math and math class since I did not do well on my sat or something else forgot what test. I personally got writing and history.

  My writing subjects and history have always been well right now I have a 96 in history I hardly get much wrong. I decided to focus on my weakness to improve it as someone who takes ADHD medication I tend to hyper focus and this caused me days of no sleep just working and working I even missed several tests major ones in my easier class because how hyper focused I was on my pre and regular math classes. My 2 classes I am usually good at took a big hit and I barely passed the 2 with a D because of this. 
  My pre and regular math classes on my 3rd major test I raged and dropped both damaging my completion rate and failing both tbh. You may ask what went wrong how can u put so much effort and fail so hard? 

  Before I start I have had the comments before ""If everyone else did good than no your wrong"" or ""If no one struggled"" etc first we have no idea how everyone else did or did not struggle on. Now here it goes I failed hard because of some of my decision but also my college.

 To begin starting with the school mess up they gave me both a pre-class and regular math class that did not even correspond with one another the pre class did not help me it was entirely different it was just more math work added on when they already knew I struggled in the first place why assign a pre class that didn't even correspond. The next part was my fault giving up my strengths to focus on my weakness lowering the high grades I could have gotten on my other classes. Another of my fault was not dropping out way sooner out of those 2 classes thinking i could do better if I kept going. The School fault this may get hate but the most awful practice to test I have ever seen before. The reviews and practices I did ok on even as well as 80+ on some of them without a doubt I should have done well on my test but here is the issue  the reviews and practices online consisted of multiple choice and several tries with well worded questions I was doing ok. The tests came and my god what the hell was the school thinking first the lock-down browser they use was shit I know its my fault for doing it last minute but as a college how did they use such a slow lock down browser none of my other classes lock down browsers were super slow each question was loading at 3+ minutes per question like imo they need to make sure those browsers are fast some of us do test last minute to get every detail of practice I do it every time with my history class browser and I am doing phenomenal.Remember how I said the practice and review maths were? Well the math test was completely the opposite. All response not multiple choice and instead of nice questions there were no questions at all I mean like it was just numbers and symbols and you had to single response each question and it was not like they were easy to see either. This all resulted in my massive fail in the math class.

conclusion: I know many things were my fault but some of it i feel wasn't like a person who can do well on a review should be able to pass the actual math tests if that does not happen something is wrong with the way the reviews are going from multiple choice well designed questions to using no questions besides symbols and numbers and single responses is such a terrible way to do this.",college,Hard College Experience Multiple Fails.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tp9qv2/hard_college_experience_multiple_fails/,1648363279.0

Freshman here. When I came to college, I was recruited for our cross country and track teams. Thru that, I made lots of friends.

However, the time commitment for these programs was huge and wasn't working out for me, and I was considering dropping it for next year. However, I started having mental health troubles around November and while they have improved, I finally decided I needed time for myself and to find some help. Therefore, I dropped track this month in March.

I'm still friends with folks in the track team, especially the freshman. However, many of them are extroverted and love going to parties n stuff - while I *don't mind* going to parties, it's not my main cup of tea. I actually have another group of friends who's social styles are more similar to mine who I've became pretty close to.

Now, I'm starting to realize I don't have much of a life. I've looked for clubs to join but none seem to pique my intersts. And while I'm close with that aforementioned group of friends, I can't always hang out with them because for one reason or another they may be busy and what not. So in some respects, I want to find a hobby where I can meet more people, and also bring them into my friend group and expand my friend circle.

This proves tough tho. Sometimes when hanging out with some people, mainly people from my major, I feel like I'll be ""judged"" for hanging out with them. I have no idea why. They're fine people. But when I hang out with people I feel I'll get along with, I feel like I'll be an outcast, as if this were middle school. I have no clue how to overcome this.

I rush to get the quiz done and ready by 11:59 and I obviously bomb it, totally unprepared and rushing.

But at least I didn’t do completely nothing, but still I have nothing to show and probably haven’t learned all that much.

I was thinking of getting a job and have been looking already and am gonna start making my resume and try applying this week/ weekend.

And it would appear the only reason I’m getting one is that I got caught unless I tell them first before they find out. Any advice? 

I feel like I should tell the truth that I did nothing because I don’t want them to find out I lied again. But I don’t wanna get like disowned for lying this long and I feel bad.

One had a child under 4 and the transfer advisor kept telling her, that the university was ""very accommodating to parents"". Nearly all of her professors had mandatory attendance policies and she couldn't arrange for childcare, nor could she really afford it. The environment totally shunned her when she reached out for help, and she could tolerate 3 months of e-mail chains and runarounds before she attended a smaller, liberal arts school that required a move and a full year off from school. My other friend had his father die due to COVID, and when he e-mailed his professors, they told him that his assignments were due at the same time regardless of his circumstances. He had to go over the prof's head, and fight to retake some assignments, and eventually felt so cheated and disrespected by the whole ordeal that he went to a trade school. And I honestly don't blame him. 

I see this from mostly the US, and in this case, you do realize we are the only country where we have to pay to go to school, and we are giving you money that we basically don't have? You can assume that all of your students are 18-24 with ample parental support and collectively shrug at why 70% of nontrads are dropping out. And it's not just us, but students with physical and psychological disabilities have to jump through backlogged hoops of fire for just a nod of agreement with certain accommodation offices. Students who commute and have to sit through 40 minutes of traffic on DC/NY/CA corridors don't have it the same (especially when it comes to gas costs now) as students who roll out of their dorms and walk 10 mins to class in the morning. 

I'm not at all shitting on the traditional students. After all, during the pandemic, over half of students in this meta-analysis reported basically meeting PHQ-9 scores for clinical depression and 2/3rds met the threshold for anxiety.

And to be real? Despite the American workforce being as bastardly as it is, most Americans don't have the same mental health stats as our students do. 

I've been working longer than some have been professors here (I'm 40+) and I want to say, YOU may feel YOU are in the right from getting your rocks off by taking advantage of teenagers that don't know any better, but you're not.

I can't believe that this is where we're ""at"" with academia, and I wish we (students) could have more of a conversation around this. I wish more arrangements could be made around dangerous and power-tripping professors, other than refusal to enroll. 

I know ""The Great Resignation"" is taking place, but, I have seriously been treated better at nearly all of my jobs by even the shittiest bosses than I have by some of my professors, and the overall fast-paced, sink-or-swim, take-delight-half-the-class-failing attitudes I have seen from professionals is NOT a good thing OR a reason to brag.

I desperately want something better for myself and my family.  My wife and I have been married for about 6 years now and we have 3 kids (Plus 2 step kids we get in the summer).  We are both 30 years and both dropped out of college at an early age.  When I was 21 I got into some trouble with the law that continued to follow me with 60k debt and a criminal background hanging over my head.  This crippled my mentally and caused me to think my options were limited for years because I was ""branded"" and forever in debt.  My wife, who went to college to be a teacher, decided that it was not going to pay the bills she needed as a mother so she dropped out.  We now carry her school debt(30k) and my debt(60k).  This is absolutely crippling to us.    


We want something better for our kids so bad.  It is not fair to them to watch us continue to fail and not give them the household advantages they deserve.  I got my Real Estate License at 26 years old thinking that I was going to make big bucks.  Only to realize that I was just chasing a dream.  Reading all of these self help books and learning so much about money, and real estate, and business, and all this fluff that later led me to be overconfident and pick the wrong career.  I've actually never admitted that.  Real estate is fun, and CAN be lucrative, but it is Feast or Famine, especially in a market like it is today.   But I don't like sales. At least right now.   


Kids take up an insane amount of time, however, they are almost old enough to ALL be in school.  FINALLY.  I just don't know where to start.  We just moved to Dallas TX to be with my mom who needs our help after my dad died.  So my family is starting from scratch.  I desperately need some help,  If I am in the wrong place, can someone direct me? 

I am trying to go by the guidelines of this subreddit.  But, what do you think is the best course of action for someone in a position like me(I know there are others out there that have been in worse situations) to move forward.  As soon as possible.  I don't want to wait another year. But with no money, I feel trapped.  And with no education on how scholarships and grants even works, I am coming to you guys for help.  I am ready to wake up everyday knowing that I made the right decision.

Do I even have a shot at gaining entry to a better school such as UF? If so what route do I even take? I'm still relatively new to college? I don't want to ask my Student Advisor because I feel like they're just going to sell me what I tell them without actually assisting me in the most beneficial way. On top of that the amount I'm paying for Tuition at Purdue is kind of extreme compared to other schools I've looked at so I'd also like to maybe even transfer to a school locally online but I'm just confused at the amount of resources or how to even research what schools are worthwhile.

Later on in life I found that I had a specific way of learning and when I could ask a ton of questions and get a better understanding I could make a mental model to learn it.

So in my early 30s I went back to school for a stem degree and the shit that comes out of teachers mouths to these teenage minds of mush is truly scary.

Teachers with PhD‘s were apologizing to students because they hurt their feelings even though the student was saying something technically incorrect.

Teachers also having a very squishy and subjective basis for grading depending upon the day it was turned in. For example if I turn it in one day early there was a noticeable increase in my grade but if I turn it in two days early my grades have consistently dropped. She’ll find some little edge case or corner opinion of “what do mean, I said blah last week”, or “so you should’ve done this here and you should’ve done this her” and I” would’ve preferred this here”

This might be a long read but I appreciate anyway that could help me out; i’m losing hope. 

 I’m 19 turning on 20 here in a few months and in my second year of college. I committed to an out of state college and it was a decision I knew wasn’t going to work out. I pledged and joined a big fraternity that fall semester. Consequently, my grades dropped dramatically. Frat life wasn’t for me, i’m a former basketball player that turned down a lot of division 1 opportunities because I got burned out (these offers came in when I was 15/16). I had lost the love for the game, so I decided to go to college as a normal kid. I quickly found out that my quality of life was astronomically worse and everything I valued in my life was nonexistent. My grades dropped so hard I had to withdraw most of my classes, my bank account plummeted as I spent almost 1.5k on food, alcohol, nicotine, you name it; college shit. I’m usually a person that works out 2x a day and social stuff comes after those things, not the other way around. I returned home to take online classes for the spring semester.

Originally, coming home for the spring was just to temporally get my grades up enough so I could be eligible for events for my fraternity. it was embarrassing to me that I had left basketball, joined a frat, and couldn’t even make grades. However, my quality of life at home was so much better. I could work out everyday, and focus on school after classes. It was definitely lonely but much better than feeling stuck in a constant party where my daily routines were stripped of me. Despite things better, I still couldn’t keep my shit together in school and managed a C in Econ and B in college algebra. 

I decided to transfer to a community college in my area to take classes over the summer and catch up on math (I withdrew from math fall semester freshman year). I took math and accounting over the summer in 8 week-online classes, such a bad idea but I was desperate from being so disappointed in myself and behind my peers. Before the first exam I caught myself screwed in math after failing the first exam. I was forced to withdraw from math and decided to re-take it the next fall semester with in-person. I finished with a disappointing C in accounting. 

Also, I had requested a general petition to have my first semester (full of w’s and failed grades) completely removed from my transcript; which succeeded. So with that semester gone, I have my online semester after coming home, summer semester, and now this fall semester.

This fall I am taking an english class that I tried taking first semester of freshman year @ university that I withdrew from, macro economics, and re-taking math. I recently fell behind in english (I found it harder since it was all online) which i’m so fucking mad at myself for; I was forced to withdraw. Recently I had felt a little sick and skipped a few math classes, the last one I didn’t mean to miss. I fell behind a few weeks in homework but I mostly caught up today… because my exam is tomorrow. even with taking the class before, I still fucking slacked this much. This is the same exam I failed last time and I realized that even if I managed to get all the homework done, I would certainly fail the exam, along with having a bad homework grade (late work). I’m going to withdraw from the math class again, it hurts so much but i’m going to be failing.

I’m torn because I keep fucking failing myself. It also hurts so much more because i’m somebody that was essentially supposed to be the kid that played professionally. A lot of people look up to me and i’m essentially a bum now? I can’t fucking get good grades and I’m not a dumb kid at all. Almost all my peers believe i’m super smart but I just keep failing. 

what should I do? can I even transfer with those grades? is grad school out of hope?would joining the military at 20 help straighten me out? 

This is an idea i’ve thought about for years. The military gives me an opportunity to work hard like in sports and better myself everyday. I’ve always heavily considered it but never pulled the trigger because i’m scared of losing my freedom of BACKING OUT, which as you can see, is the story of my entire fucking life.

tldr: I’m and ex athlete that is failing college and has continuously withdrew from courses from bad grades. This is my second year of college and I had my first semester of year one waived from my transcript. I just withdrew from 2 classes I previously withdrew from. i’m letting myself down time and time again. i’m losing hope.

This is probably the least amount of work I've ever done in the first few months of a semester so far and I don't see myself able to recover. I've been considering dropping out since Spring 2021 but was given a second chance with financial aid, so I decided to keep going but I haven't put in much work. I think my depression has been getting much worse and I've seeked help on campus, but I have to go through all these hoops and paperwork to get the proper help that it's just a joke that I don't feel like dealing with. Truth is, all I want to do is play video games all day and do nothing. Lately, I can't even find myself enjoying a game for that long before I get bored of it.

ACCT 101 is an intro class.  Required for all business majors at my school and ofc the stepping stone for accounting majors. Since it is an intro class, I assumed it would be easy. But this is the most difficult class I have ever taken!

I took this class in the fall semester, but it was too hard so I dropped it. Worried the grade would affect my GPA. My grade was a 63%. Now I'm taking it again. But this class seems even harder than the last.

Each week, we go over a new chapter. The professor expects us to read the chapter ahead of time. Plus notes. Our homework assignments (only worth 10%) have 10-15 problems, each taking 20 min or more to do. We have those once a week. We have only 3 exams during the semester. Each worth 30% towards final grade. 

In my fall ACCT 101 class, everyone failed the first exam except 2 ppl. (The exam had 2 parts, multiple choice 30% and problems 70%. There were only 3 problems ).We had 20ish people in that class. Half the class dropped after that. Including me. With almost everyone failing, I thought it was more so a professor issue then a subject issue.

253,sadterpthrowaway,1645568071,/r/college/comments/sz01ju/i_dropped_a_class_with_an_intent_to_change_my/,"I've drastically changed my future plans. I was neuroscience and premed, and I came in with a psych degree from a community college. So, I had to take extremely hard math/science classes on top of one another. I had to re-take precalc because I didn't meet the math testing requirements, and the precalc class at the new school was so terrible and shitty (the average grade of all students taking it was a 1.9, and this doesn't account for the W's). I also had to take organic chem, and we've managed to drag it out for 3 semesters. Dropped it first time, passed it second time, and then dropped orgo 2. That was this class.

I've just been so miserable under these conditions. There is virtually \*no\* help available at the school for organic chemistry, but there is a 200/hr tutor if you google the school's name/subject. There is also paid tutoring available from the school, but only so much can come from the budget, and I've done group studies. Basically nobody knows what's going on, either, and those sessions just turn into loafing and joking. Looking back, I probably spend a thousand or more in tutoring/software/books/book keys/lab fees, etc, just to understand this subject. They have things like GSS and discussions, but most override with my other classes, or take place on campus, and I commute. I live 20 mins away. Burning all that gas and waiting in traffic burns me out and just isn't worth it sometimes, you know? 

I can't tell you how frustrating it is to not understand something even after you've poured hours of your life into it. You have no real way to ask questions or get help. 

And, at the other point, I just winged-it and bullshitted my other classes, and made all A's. I probably spent 15 minutes a week on them, compared to my o-chem classes, which I drained every waking hour of my free-time into. However, just one C has done so much irreparable damage to my GPA (3.8 to 3.2, and I have already taken 70 credits), so its going to take a lot more A's to get me back to where I was, and the A's only provide a boost of 3.7, unless we get 97 or more in the class. 

This is my second time dropping a class, and my third semester here. Neuroscience was limited enrollment, so I had to complete all of these extremely hard science benchmarks to even declare the major. I also have an incomplete. I am just not good at this stuff and the school has been silent in regards to ADS accommodations and assistance with the course material. 

So... I'm switching to public health. It is an essay-based, reading-based program. There are no benchmarks. Independent work. Thank fuck. 

I'm just so worried the school has me as a ""Red flag"" student and will enforce harsh rules.

I'm worried I will run out of financial aid. 

I'm worried my advisor won't allow me to continue. 

I also feel so shitty, like I failed, and I'm not good enough as everyone else. Most people in the neuro program were double majors in public health AND neuroscience, or something as equally as rigorous, like biochem. On top of this, they did the premed work-up, with volunteering, shadowing, working clinical jobs, etc. I'm worried that if these are the people I'm competing with to get an epi job, that I'm going to have to force myself into stem classes again, just to be competitive, and my brain doesn't jive with them. Biology and anatomy, I KILLED those classes, above 100%s. Chem and math, that's when I start to hit walls, and achieving A's in those classes are a major crapshoot. If my GPA drops anymore though, I won't even be competitive to get a master's, let alone anything beyond that. 

I'm no longer premed. I've re-evaluated my priorities. I'd like to go into epidemiology, or something similar. Maybe in another time, another space, I can take a few neuro courses.

I've been trying to work on a PowerPoint presentation for the last 3 hours and I have only been able to get titles on the page due to being so anxious. I'm hoping yall can give me some feedback on my situation and if I should file a complaint or if I'm just being a POS. 

Prior to the start of this semester, I was planning to take a Math class and a 1-credit introductory education course. I went to a doctor appointment in January and was advised I needed surgery to remove a lipoma from my abdomen somewhere between the size of a baseball and a softball. I immediately emailed my professors about missing roughly 3 weeks worth of classes between pre-surgery quarantine and recovery. I heard from my one credit course immediately and they recommended I drop the course because I would miss 1/3 of the class meetings in that time period. I never heard from the Math professor. So I dropped the one credit course and emailed a separate professor of an educ course and explained the surgery-missed time situation and asked if things would be cool and she said yes, we could work something out to get my work done. Sounds good. 

Then the day that I spoke to this professor, my brother developed covid symptoms and I took him and myself to get tested and we both came back positive-this is two days before classes begin. So I immediately emailed my professor to let her know I'd miss class the next day, and emailed the public safety dept. of my school per instructions on their covid policy page. 

Public Safety emailed me back the next morning asking questions about exposure, had I been to campus, etc. I answered later that morning, with no response I emailed the next afternoon asking the school's covid policies, when/how can I return, do I need a negative test, what? I never got a response. At the same time, I was instructed by public safety to email my school's wellness center a copy of my covid results. I did, and then their response was asking me why I was sending it. So I explained to them the situation so far, and asked them the same questions I had for public safety on the same day. The wellness center's response was thst someone from the university has/will be in contact with me, and that I needed a PCR test after 5 days.  

I asked the testing center where I was positive about a PCR test and the said I should not do that because I can test positive for months with that test after no longer being contagious.  I informed the wellness center of this, and never got a response back. Two days later, I emailed the Dean of Students explaining my covid test and asking when could I return. 

Finally this led to me getting a couple phone calls from the CARES dept at the school where I then had to answer all the questions I already answered in emails again. I was told I couldn't return to campus until 10 days since my positive test. Finally I have an answer. So I get to attend my first class on Wednesday 1/26. Went to class, intending to ask professor about how to do work that I'll miss for my surgery, as so far there had been no work in class. Class ends, and she says as we're leaving and I'm walking up to her to talk, that the next class is canceled. I ask her about getting work that I will miss for my surgery and class notes and she tells me to ask a classmate, while everyone is already gone. I live off campus and have no idea who is even in my class and no opportunity to get a contact with anyone during class.

So I then didn't attend class for the next 3 weeks because of covid test and surgery preventing me from driving/walking across campus, or sitting in a desk for 2 hours. I posted on our Google classroom asking for class notes and I didn't get any response for a few days until the professor responded to me that it would be nice for someone to send their notes. Then I got one person to send me their notes and I asked them to continue to send me notes while I was missing class. 

Here's the good part; my professor emailed me last Monday, asking me when I would be attending class again, as the CARES dept said I should be back in class by 1/26 and that I have a bunch of missed classes. I explained to her as a reminder about my positive covid test and then quarantine prior to my surgery+missing time for surgery. I told her I had stopped by our school's wellness center about my surgery prior to the semester. They told me I simply needed to talk to my professor about the surgery and making up the work I missed. She then informs me, and I quote -"" I've received emails from the CARES dept for more than just covid"" and in order to be excused for attendance purposes I must contact her before class. Which I did before the semester and is the only reason I signed up for the class.

I responded to her asking if the CARES dept is for more than just covid, and the office I talked to prior to the semester and how they didn't tell me about this CARES thing, and I reminded her that I brought this to her attention prior to the semester. She hasn't responded and the last email I sent her was last Monday (we didn't have class Wednesday). 

So here is am posting this, partially to gather my thoughts in case I do file a complaint, though I dont even know how or where to go. My girlfriend thinks I should have filed a complaint simply from the rudeness of my professor in the latest email exchange, and that I'm gaslighting myself when I shouldn't be. I'm struggling with my current assignment because of anxiety and the fact that I've barely got any information to work with, the class notes that one person has sent me has nothing relevant to the project and I can't find anything in the book. 

Should I file a complaint? Who to? Did I just screw up this situation and deserve the bs I'm dealing with? Please help me figure out what to do.

TL;DR missed a bunch of class for medical reasons and professor has not made course more easily accessible, now I'm struggling quite a bit. Is it my own fault and I should just suck it up, or should I contact someone at my school for assistance?

I've been trying to work on a PowerPoint presentation for the last 3 hours and I have only been able to get titles on the page due to being so anxious. I'm hoping yall can give me some feedback on my situation and if I should file a complaint or if I'm just being a POS. 

Prior to the start of this semester, I was planning to take a Math class and a 1-credit introductory education course. I went to a doctor appointment in January and was advised I needed surgery to remove a lipoma from my abdomen somewhere between the size of a baseball and a softball. I immediately emailed my professors about missing roughly 3 weeks worth of classes between pre-surgery quarantine and recovery. I heard from my one credit course immediately and they recommended I drop the course because I would miss 1/3 of the class meetings in that time period. I never heard from the Math professor. So I dropped the one credit course and emailed a separate professor of an educ course and explained the surgery-missed time situation and asked if things would be cool and she said yes, we could work something out to get my work done. Sounds good. 

Then the day that I spoke to this professor, my brother developed covid symptoms and I took him and myself to get tested and we both came back positive-this is two days before classes begin. So I immediately emailed my professor to let her know I'd miss class the next day, and emailed the public safety dept. of my school per instructions on their covid policy page. 

Public Safety emailed me back the next morning asking questions about exposure, had I been to campus, etc. I answered later that morning, with no response I emailed the next afternoon asking the school's covid policies, when/how can I return, do I need a negative test, what? I never got a response. At the same time, I was instructed by public safety to email my school's wellness center a copy of my covid results. I did, and then their response was asking me why I was sending it. So I explained to them the situation so far, and asked them the same questions I had for public safety on the same day. The wellness center's response was thst someone from the university has/will be in contact with me, and that I needed a PCR test after 5 days.  

I asked the testing center where I was positive about a PCR test and the said I should not do that because I can test positive for months with that test after no longer being contagious.  I informed the wellness center of this, and never got a response back. Two days later, I emailed the Dean of Students explaining my covid test and asking when could I return. 

Finally this led to me getting a couple phone calls from the CARES dept at the school where I then had to answer all the questions I already answered in emails again. I was told I couldn't return to campus until 10 days since my positive test. Finally I have an answer. So I get to attend my first class on Wednesday 1/26. Went to class, intending to ask professor about how to do work that I'll miss for my surgery, as so far there had been no work in class. Class ends, and she says as we're leaving and I'm walking up to her to talk, that the next class is canceled. I ask her about getting work that I will miss for my surgery and class notes and she tells me to ask a classmate, while everyone is already gone. I live off campus and have no idea who is even in my class and no opportunity to get a contact with anyone during class.",college,File a Complaint?

258,RatboyPeanus,1645274824,/r/college/comments/sw9au6/what_to_do_if_a_college_professor_is_not_doing/,"Hi! I have a question. This is my final semester and I really want to graduate in May since I only have four classes left to finish! I am doing great in the other three, but something bizarre happened with one class. 
The teacher that was actually supposed to teach dropped out last minute and they replaced her with a guy who is not doing ANYTHING for the class. We did an introduction discussion form and thats about it. Super disappointing considering how much money the college charges for these classes ... 
I have kind of held back on reporting him to the school because the last time I reported another teacher for basically the same thing (he never read his emails or updated grades until like 2 months later, but at least he had assignments!) they gave him my name and he gave me a really stern lecture after class 💀. I don’t want that again and I want to give this guy the benefit of the doubt that he has stuff going on. I am getting really nervous about it, though.
He keeps emailing us every couple weeks saying that the class is still active and that he will add stuff and just “cut a few chapters” but it is the 7th week of school now out of a 14 week semester. 
What I am worried about now is if he just doesn’t do anything and I have waited too late to do anything. I think other students have also brought it up to either him or the school but nothing has changed. If he really never adds anything, will this stop me from graduating, or can I contend it? I would hate if the school decided we didn’t do enough to deserve to pass and I would have to wait another semester to graduate, because it is not our fault.
I also really hope he doesn’t post like 900 things at once and have them all due in a day, but at this point I have really low hope of any assignments getting posted. I think I might wait and see what happens for one more week so I don’t ruin this guy’s day for reporting him, but I really don’t see us finishing what he thinks we can get done in only 7 weeks.

260,sunojoo,1645127863,/r/college/comments/suxq3c/dropping_out_of_college/,"I'm a Freshman at a four-year university. It's about a 6 hour drive from my family and costs me (with pretty heavy scholarships) $38,000 a year. I went to college originally without a plan, and was seriously considering going to community college for two years to get gen eds out of the way and figure out what I want to study (I also received a scholarship for free tuition to my local community college). I ended up going to the school I am at now, though, because neither of my parents were able to go away for school and wanted me to have the 'college experience' (and I agreed it could be fun). 

I don't think that experience is worth it. After just a semester, I've changed my major three times. And now I'm realizing that I won't be able to change it again if I want to graduate in four years. I don't have many (if any) friends, just some cool people I hang out with on weekends. I did meet my boyfriend here, though, and for that I'm really glad I made the decision to go away. But now I feel really lost.

Honestly, I don't know what to do. I worked really hard in high school, and stressed myself out the point where I had no friends, no social life, and a number of mental health issues. I don't want to repeat that. 

The issue is, this the first time I (as an 18 year old) have the freedom to do what I want. I don't have to go to college. I don't have to live at home. It's so much choice it's almost too much. And I don't know what to do with it all.

I guess I was hoping for advice. I know I want to go to school and get a degree (honestly if I could just go to school and learn forever that would be ideal, but I am not made of money). But I want to wait until I know what I want to major in and pursue before I go away. In the meantime, what should I do? My parents suggested living at home and working full time so I can relax from school stress and then go back after a year. My boyfriend is planning on transferring to my home state and finishing his degree at a nearby college. I was thinking about going to community college, but to do what? Or maybe try to find internships to try things out? Maybe get a job somewhere more 'adult' to see what I like (I've worked retail/food for the past 5 years)?

I've also planned at least that I don't want to get sucked up into the void of working a job I don't particularly care for and living in my home state. I've already decided that if after 2-3 years I don't see any progress with my career/life, I'll go back to a 4 year institution and major in some skill like Computer Science that I know will be able to make me money.

If anyone has any advice, maybe you dropped out at one point. Maybe you took a gap year that helped you. Or you came to some profound realization after graduating. Anything would help. I have also saved up enough money working the past 5 years to support myself fully for at least one year (though I'd obviously not want to blow my savings and just sit around, I know that I won't be homeless or starve while I figure things out)

Wow that was a doozy. I'm sorry lol

TLDR; I'm dropping out of college. I don't know what to do with my time while I try to 'figure out my life' (I know, cliche). Any advice or input would be helpful.

\*\*I'd also like to point out that I know how privileged this is, to be able to want to take the time to figure out what I want to do. I'm very lucky to have a supportive family and the money saved up to take time off. I'm sorry if this offends anybody, but I really want to do what's right for me and I don't know what that is.

I've done trade certifications, work in a relatively secure field but when it comes to doing college my brain explodes.

I have signed up for 3-4 classes over the last idk 5 years. And dropped them all within the first week. And you know I had to eat that cost and pay out of pocket. I even flipped out and cussed out a professor during week 1 and it was not their fault, they were doing their ""job"" (although to me arguably they are not doing their job, giving people a syllabus and having them post on a forum is not higher education if you ask me, it's not even teaching but tomato potato), anyways I had a mental explosion and took it out on someone who was doing what they were told was acceptable by their superiors so it's not really their fault.

I feel lost not sure if it's because or language barrier or the transition from calculation towards pure math but probably both. Right now, I'm restarting my foundation year while planning to take Alevel as a private candidate.

I thought I was into applied math for a moment. But now going back to calculation/applied math style, I feel so pointless for being given certain formulas without knowing the intuition behind it and just apply, becoming a ""robotic"" task one could say. This has caused me to doubt my decision once again. After taking some time off pure math, part of me feel like I should give math a go once again. I feel the urge to learn math from a first principle standpoint (though personally I am still not sure if school should really be testing our rigorous proofing skills?). And after all, in terms of my career, I am considering to be a math tutor. So, it would be logical if I learn the materials in a deeper level?

FYI, I did look into other fields, but I really don't feel much interest in those other than math? perhaps just accounting/data science? But career wise, I believe math might be more useful? Should I try again in pursuing math and just deal with it accordingly?

Unfortunately the year I graduated high school was also the year Covid-19 happened; while I was still in high school we transitioned into online learning. 

In short I got complacent with online learning. Teachers were more lenient and whatnot so I was able to do the bare minimum. I ended up graduating high school in quarantine. When I started going to college it wasn’t online but hybrid. The transition to that was... not good. First few weeks was pretty solid but after driving an hour to school at 7 AM five days a week and coming back home at 4 PM it took a toll on me. I skipped classes and my grades started to slip. My first semester ended with a 1.5 GPA with almost all my classes failing. 

In second semester they told me I was going on academic probation. But at that point I was just drained out. So I didn’t pay the enrollment for second semester and just dropped out. I ended up taking a year and a half off and am planning to go back.

I’m planning to go to a community college this year that’s much closer to where I live and pursue a degree in ADN rather than a BSN. But the question is... would they take me? I’m not delusional to think that there wouldn’t be repercussions to my mistakes so if they don’t accept what can I do?

It should be noted that I do have an associate’s degree and dropped out very early into a 4 year, so I only really wasted a semester’s worth of money and still have paper to my name.

My reasoning was a combination of factors: depression, anxiety, Covid, the death of my dad and cat, the feeling of not really learning any practical skills, and especially the cost. $2.5k a class for boring professors to read outdated PowerPoints is not exactly enticing, regardless of if you like school or not.

So after debating dropping out for the 4th time in my college life, I finally did it the last day to get a full refund for tuition. At first I was scared, but then I was met with overwhelming happiness and relief. No more classes I don’t care about, no more stress of taking tests or working a crappy restaurant job, and no more being completely broke due to part time wages and tuition/books.

Luckily for me, the field I wanted to get into is one that’s fairly easy to get into without bachelors degrees - IT. I got a full time job with benefits doing IT Support for $45k a year. This is $45k a year with a fraction of the debt of a 4 year college grad and 2 years before I would’ve graduated. The best part is I’m making essentially three times as much doing half as much work as my restaurant job. My friends doing internships in IT were doing the same positions as the guy who dropped out. And in the end, who do you think will have more work experience than them?

My point is: while it may not be in everyone’s best interest to drop out, you really have to ask yourself, “is college where I want to be right now, or at all?” I get there are industries where a degree is mandatory or very important, but you might have options. I learned way more at community college than I ever did at university. In the end, anybody who feels done with college should really weigh their options.

i’m in a very small philosophy course, i’m talking 6 students, and the professor. first day of the class i was already uncomfortable as i am the only girl in the class but given it was such a small class i thought it wouldn’t matter and i could give it a try. 
on this first day of class, the professor makes weird jokes(??) about hillary clinton being a man, but as like, an example of a “logically sound argument”, but obviously done for humorous purposes. i don’t really gaf about hillary clinton personally but it was kinda weird and stuck out in my mind, i took a picture of this on the zoom call, and this coupled with some other stuff makes me uncomfortable. i therefore never unmuted on the zoom calls again after we had after very brief introductions. i have a gender neutral name so this professor may not have even processed that i’m a girl and these comments are weird.
over time this professor continually makes comments about women, particularly celebrities, at one point going so far as to talk about how big a female celebrity’s boobs are, again, to this class of 6 students. i say nothing but write down the date, as it made me extremely uncomfortable. i ended up missing a class or two because the class made me really uncomfortable and i had some personal issues, but emailed the professor to let him know i was going to catch up and asked a question about the course material.

this week, we started in person classes (it was soon before because covid). i was really anxious, i didn’t like the vibe of the class at all, i’ve already had some weird ass classes last semester. but it wasn’t the biggest deal, i went in on monday for a class and it went smoothly, i was one of the only students who participated &amp; answered questions. today, i have the class again, but upon checking the course online i found i was no longer registered. i thought at first it was an issue with payment, as we had paid kinda late, so i called the office of registration to fix the issue before my class started.
they inform me i was dropped for “non pursuit”. even tho i was clearly engaged and  contacted my professor about wanting to catch up. he made no effort to contact me before suddenly dropping me from the class.
i want to give him the benefit of the doubt, but coupled with his misogynistic comments throughout the classes this semester, being dropped from the class basically a day after this man confirms i’m a woman makes me question a lot. i don’t really know why i was dropped if i made an effort to come to class just the day before &amp; had emailed the professor clearly showing interest in the class, as well as having been one of the few participatory students in monday’s session. 

my friends and my father think i should file a complaint whether or not i am registered back to this class, as his comments made me really uncomfortable and not want to attend his class as a woman. however, i don’t want to come off as calling him misogynistic because it could technically all be a coincidence, and i’m also afraid of consequences from the school or the professor if i was put back into the class after filing this complaint as it could make my semester even more uncomfortable.

I am getting my degree for Medical Laboratory Science. My tuition bill was paid in full in January. Some came from federal loans, and I paid the rest out of pocket. Yesterday I received an email from the financial services office stating I exceeded my undergraduate federal loan limit by $2,629 and that I need to pay this balance immediately or I will be dropped from my classes. Since the semester is half over, they won't let me sign up for a payment plan. I don't have $2,629 just laying around though. I have applied for a private loan through Sallie Mae but I'm not sure if that will be approved. Can they do this though? It doesn't seem fair that I'm being penalized because the employee who submits the federal aid loan requests overshot my eligibility, correct? I guess what I'm asking here is:

1. Does anyone know if I have any options I can pursue?
2. Is it possible to argue this balance? (I was told by their office that it is not, but I don't know if that's accurate or she just didn't want me to protest it)
3. How is it legal for them to do this? It's my final semester, my last 2 classes and now, half way through the semester I suddenly have to come up with $2629?
4. Can I submit a complaint against the school for this? It feels predatory, but maybe I'm being dramatic.

I dropped out because I plagiarised a final essay (and not in the sense of just 2/3 sentences) without me being aware of how I was writing is plagiarism. In hindsight this sounds really stupid but I genuinely wasn't aware until I saw that I copied one sentence straight off a source. 

Now the thing is that I now realise that the way I was writing was just entirely wrong. Not sure if this is just me being dumb or not getting enough guidance in essay writing in high school or something, but I was literally just doing random things. I know I fucked up massively. I have tried to see the positive side from this and have really tried to improve my writing and it genuinely was a massive wake up call and allowed me to properly write academically (I guess failing can be a lesson) 

The thing now is that I see that because of my writing, I could point out maybe two more assignments where I have conducted plagiarism. Unknowingly, sure, but it still violates the rules. I'm just not entirely sure if this is something that I should bring up to an exam board etc. It might seem excessive but on the other hand this stuff is really serious and it makes me question myself a lot.",college,Question regarding plagiarism in undergrad,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/snn1lf/question_regarding_plagiarism_in_undergrad/,1644352551.0

That following fall semester I re-took it but ended up failing due to a whole heap of reasons. I could go on about excuses, but ultimately I have to accept that my immaturity is what caused me to fail.

For a retake, I had to get my counselors signed approval, as the third attempt is the last one you can do. I’m in community college at a pretty shitty school, in a pretty shitty I had to move to for financial reasons when the pandemic hit.

The first two semesters for me were perfect, but ultimately I spiraled down for a multitude of reasons and fucked up pretty bad all in all last year.

I know it's easier for some of them because some are living together via dorms and I'm one of the people who commute.

I'm trying not to let it bother me, especially since my grades are a lot more important than friends. It's just hard sometimes. I've always been the weird person. I wasn't popular in high school. I barely had friends. Instead kids went back and forth between bullying me and ignoring me. The last few years of high school, my grades weren't nearly as good because school was just torture for me and I couldn't focus on school work anymore.

From ages 17-25 I went to a university for a year, community college a few years, and lastly attended Liberty University online.  I came pretty close to finishing the degree at Liberty, but burnt out, failed a few classes and dropped out.  As it stands now I have a 2.6 GPA and am only 21 units from finishing the degree.  But...

The degree was in Bible and Theology, and I have virtually no interest in that field of study anymore.  I've finally realized that I'm interested in studying psychology, and I'm way more sure about this path now than I ever was about my education in the past (part of why I struggled with motivation and ultimately dropped out).

If I pursue psychology I will definitely want to get some kind of graduate degree after undergrad.  So I'm wondering... should I finish the Liberty undergrad degree in a subject I'm no longer interested in and then pivot to an MA in psychology afterwards?  Or would it be better to pivot now to finishing my undergrad in psychology, even if it means starting over at the transfer level?

Other factors include: I learned a few years ago that I have ADHD and online school is NOT for me (this helped explain why I struggled so much after high school, and also led me to psychology).  I am more motivated now and also know myself a lot better, so I think I could finish at Liberty online if it was genuinely the best path... but I'm not thrilled about that option and it seems like a bit of a risk that I might burn out and fail classes again.

I could try to do a couple online classes and then my final semester in-person at Liberty to finish the degree.  I have a lot more confidence in my ability to succeed academically with in-person classes.  If I did this I could theoretically finish the degree by the end of 2022.

I could give up on the religious degree altogether and transfer to a state school (I live in CA) to finish undergrad in psychology.  This would take longer, but I'm not in that big of a hurry at this point, I'm already 30 lol.  I like that this would give me a way to test out the field of psychology and become more prepared for grad school, rather than jumping straight into it.

Also I'll be honest, I'm pretty lonely and don't have a lot of ways to meet people currently, so attending a university in person sounds pretty appealing in that regard.

I'm really good at it and **I have extensive teaching experience, but no degree and no teaching credential in California.** And now I really want both of those things so I can teach at the High School I graduated from. I have debt from student loans already, and I would love to avoid going too much further into it if I could. I currently have a salary job and a side-hustle that allows me to save money.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to finish my degree ONLINE, in the CHEAPEST and FASTEST manner possible. As long as I can be qualified to teach High School in the state of California, I'm solid. I'm looking into programs like [Western Governors University](https://www.wgu.edu/).

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Need a bachelor's + California HS teaching credential ASAP

Mods, I apologize if this isn’t for this Reddit, and if it’s not feel free to direct me to a better sub. 

I’m a 21 year old student, who has 2 years under my belt at a university, and I dropped out due to covid and work. I moved states, got a new job, and am now interested in returning to school. Are there any services that exist to help find schools to apply to and complete their applications? Now that I’m outside the school system, I realize I don’t have the benefits that come with a high school, or college, academic advisor. I need assistance finding universities to apply to that are realistic for me, and I can afford.

Aside from the community college that I go to, I don't really know a lot about it. So, my apologies if I am just ignorant of some basic fact. Anyways, my parents have sat me and my brothers down and told us that they would not be supporting us financially through college. We were, (I believe understandably) upset about this, and I just think that it doesn't even make any sense. It would be one thing if my parents could not afford it, but my dad makes over six figures, and saves a great deal of his money. (Recently though, he might get fired from his job due to refusing a COVID vaccine, but that doesn't really matter here.)

The main thing is that while I am going to basically be all on my own once I leave high school, I won't be able to get support from student aid programs due to how much money my family already makes. My parents aren't super knowledgeable when it comes to college, both of them dropped out before they could get their two-year degree. I really want to be able to go to a nice school and pursue a career in medicine, but I know that I will be struggling at best if I chose this route. They tell me that scholarships can easily cover my full cost, but my mom's college was paid for by her parents, and my dad dropped out after a year, so they don't really know a ton about this stuff. It just sucks to know I'll struggle more than I have to because of my parent's ""tough love"" by not supporting us at all. 

I'm working right now to graduate HS with a two-year degree from a local community college, but I just can't do this all on my own.

I only have three completed semesters. I finally have my life together, completed rehab recently, and now I want to go back to school because when it's going well it's really fulfilling for me. But I think I'm going to try community college this time- this isn't really what I want to discuss though.

The two degrees I'm leaning toward are Diagnostic Medical Sonography and Speech Language Pathologist Assistant. And out of those I'm more on the side of the first one. I'm pretty interested in it but it's very science-y and I haven't taken science classes since high school. The only college level science course I took was intro to entomology and I liked it and did well, but that's bugs, not humans.

I definitely have a humanities brain and that's what I'm passionate about, but I'm more money and career-driven now (realistically what was I going to do with an English or religious studies bachelor's.) I guess I'm just worried my brain doesn't work like that and I'm going to get into something that I ultimately can't handle and embarrass myself- very afraid of failure. But I haven't tried science in so long, maybe I could do it?

I didn't have the best fall semester academically, socially, or mentally. My GPA dropped (and there's a policy here where freshman year grades don't count on the full official transcript anyway so rip) and I became really irritable and withdrawn from social activities toward the end of the semester. I could barely breathe and I was in a rut and just wanted to go home.

I feel like I've made it the goal of my life almost just to get away from home. I went to a very rigorous high school and it kind of set into me this mentality that the only path is graduate, go straight to college for four years or less, get a job / go to grad school / whatever.

But I still haven't solidified my interests and my school's dystopian COVID response is continuing to ruin any chance of real social development through physical activities. I feel like I'm just running from task to task overstimulating myself without properly developing, and indeed I severely overcommitted and burned out last fall. 

The thing is, I'm on a full ride here. I gave up several other offers based on National Merit at state schools to come to this small international campus but I can't get those offers back. Thus I know I am not going to transfer because doing so would put me in debt and my parents were never intent on contributing more than $10k a year to my education for sure.

Thus I tell myself I can ""tough it out"", but I'm scared things won't change. The first few weeks might feel rejuvenating, but I'll ultimately fall into the same failures and angst as this semester. Life is just moving me by too fast, I feel. I'm a bit better after break but towards the end I was very irritable and could barely get out of bed in the morning. I'll have a safety net on campus - meal plan, housing, and some money from stipend and assistantship to have discretionary spending. I don't know what I'd have at home.

I doubt my resume is ""unique"" enough and I live in a car-dependent sprawly place without a car of my own (I could get a license pretty quickly, but affording my own car is probably pretty questionable) which would prevent me from access to most of the opportunities in my hometown. Thus I would have to look for opportunities and programs in major cities anywhere in the world where I can live without a car and then the housing and living expenses that would entail.

I know that taking an LoA wouldn't affect my aid. But doing just one semester would put me off cycle for applying for stuff, so if I take one then I might as well take two. I could stay home and work a service job to keep me busy and get the money to afford online classes and stuff, not sure.

I dropped out of highschool when I was 17 and I earned my GED. The decision was mostly due to family issues, but I was also a pretty terrible student back then in all honesty. About a year later when I was 18 or so, I signed up for a couple of classes at my local community college. I was working full time and I really had no direction back then, so I ended up dropping out those classes halfway through the semester and never really thinking about it again, convinced that college simply wasn't for me. I didn't complete either of the classes I was taking, I assumed the professors dropped me from the classes, but I never even checked my transcript or grades after that. I don't know if they count as withdraw fail, simply failing, or anything else, I simply left and I never thought about it until now. To be honest, it never crossed my mind that I might need to include anything to do with that short stint because it was so long ago, and obviously I wasn't planning on transferring any failed classes from there so I guess I just considered it irrelevant, up until now that is.

I'm applying to transfer into a good state university this fall, so I'm working on the application now. Admission into the engineering program is competitive, and the GPA cutoff is high.

Am I required to disclose my time at the previous community college, and submit a transcript for it? I'm worried that my poor/nonexistent grades there are going to drag down all of the hard work I've put in at my current school, and I'd really like to simply omit it, but I'm not sure if that's allowed or really how to go about it at all. I've read that universities check the national clearinghouse for grades sometimes, would my record at that previous community college show up on there if I didn't complete a single credit and didn't list that prior community college on my application?

On mobile, please forgive format. Will also be cross-posting to other subreddits. I am a little all over the place so please bare with me. 

I am 19F. 2020 and 2021 were rollercoasters for me in terms of living situation, college choice and life. 

I attended a private university for the first half of my freshmen year, Fall 2020. But due to financial constraints and overall BS I transferred to a local community college for Spring 2021. 

I took general courses in the Spring because I genuinely don't know what to do with my life but unfortunately my time at the private uni was a waste since I was enrolled in Cybersecurity specific courses. 

I was originally going to transfer to a state school in Fall 2021, however things went south with my mother at home. 

As a result, I packed as much as I could and went to stay with a friend while I waited for approval to enter Canada to live with my boyfriend and his family to attend a university there. Big life change. 

I was admitted to the local university here as an international student under general studies for Fall 2021. Once again I took general courses to fulfill general requirements- but unfortunately I fell into a terrible state of mental health and I barely passed so my GPA most likely dropped. I know it's still above a 3.0 at the moment, but its killing me inside that I don't have a 4.0 ( I was a straight A honors student in high school with high test scores and I was in the top 1% of my class. ) 

To provide some context, my mother was very hard on me with grades and just being the golden child as a whole. I would study nonstop and keep straight A's at the expense of my sanity. I am no longer in that environment but I still feel the pressure that I have to know what I want to do for the rest of my life. I had little to no parental presence or advice age 10+. 

I feel anxious and lost. I don't want to spend more time in university than needed but I know I am heading down that path because I keep changing my mind on what I want to do with myself. 

I have picked up a love for baking and I always loved working in cafes so I could finish a degree and go for that, but I fear the backlash from the people around me. I'm more than happy with working with coffee and maybe even opening a side business with delivering homemade baked goods. Cons however is that its customer service, and a decently low salary to pay off student debt. 

However, I love writing and am looking at entering the narrative writing sides of the video game industry. I've loved English since I was younger and always excelled in subjects with the Arts. Same cons as just working in a cafe though. There isn't a lot of money in this field either. 

The bigger two, yet rather nearly impossible options, are Nursing and/or Psychiatry. I was always inspired by the medical field despite struggling with math and science and I wanted to make a difference for those considered ""mentally ill"" or just helping people in the hospitals. However I don't believe I have the GPA anymore for medical school, and also due to Canadas education system being a little bit different than the states, Id have to spend extra time ""retaking"" some high school science courses. While I'd spend extra time in school, the payoff would be tremendous.. and so would the debt lol. But I would get to help people and make a difference for those who never had the help... like myself. 

In summary, I am looking at the following as career choices:
- Cafe worker
- Narrative Writer
- Psychiatrist
- Nurse 

I keep getting torn in all directions. And I can't just drop out of school since my studies are the main thing keeping me in Canada since I am not a citizen, and I also want to get a degree. I want this achievement for myself for all the hells I've been through. 

I just don't know where to start. I don't know what to do. I have an amazing support system now and my boyfriend is being so patient and sweet. I never had this support. The people around me are so sweet and telling me that its ok for me to take time to figure this out, but I want to figure this out for myself. I am entering Year 3 of university and I don't want to be here forever. And I want a career I'll be happy with.

For more context: I’m a California resident that attended New York University. Unfortunately, living in New York made me feel very depressed and isolated (it’s also too cold xD).

312,SinopaHyenith-Renard,1640597583,/r/college/comments/rpjrx1/military_prospective_college_student_need_advice/,"Good Morning College Redditors,

I am a Former Senior Military College Student who enlisted in the Marine Corps as an Active Reserve Marine (Unlike Regular Reserves or National Guard; I work Full Time Active-Duty for 3-6month Times). I dropped out at the end of my Freshman Year of College with a because of my terrible GPA and the inability to at least maintain a C average in any of my classes despite by Good performance in High School. 

Before I Officially Enlisted, I took Summer Online Classes at my Local Community College and flunked two easy courses and still have to pay for them and my first of of college via student loans. I refused to waste anymore of my (future) money and time and enlisted mainly for the educational benefits, setting the foundations for a potential Military career, and gain the academic discipline I lacked in College. 

I applied for admission into two schools and already one rejected me for my terrible academic performance from College and I believe the next one is gonna do the same regardless of how well I put together their essays. 

My Call Of Duty starts the beginning of January and ends in June so I don’t know if I will be able to balance online credits with Tuition Assistance with a Full-Time work and would rather postpone it or take CLEP exams during my downtime while learning on my own. 

After June however, I have a dilemma. I need to take at least 15credits during the Summer to prove I’m capable of handing a College Curriculum. I am considering Community College to fill this in but I don’t know if I can bring myself to success because I have been out of a classroom setting for over a year and a half now and don’t want to blow my money again. I also don’t know if my GI bill will cover Summer School. 

If I don’t get accepted into my colleges of choice I am willing to do a full semester of college, but that will provide a another problem. My family, I love my Mom and older Sister but living with them during the pandemic and right now on Christmas Vacation/Leave has lowered my self-esteem, made me depressed, and made me resort to bad habits. I don’t want to live with them if I were to be in school and would rather enlist Full Active Duty than stay anymore than 3 days with them. Is there an organization that can help with finding housing for prospective College students? I am willing to find a part-time job in addition to my Military Service to get me out of the house. What should I know about moving for a 21 year old College Student?

I was taking a course in a university in my country during covid-19, I felt that is discrimination.

The rule was that you should gather at least 5 people and should speak in front of them. but everyone didn't want to meet or didn't want to stay with people because of COVID-19 in the June of last year. So, it appeared that I really want to record a video alone or allow me to meet people on Zoom to speech.

The professor didn't allow so I appeared again that I can't meet anyone because of Covid-19. So, she suggested dropping out of her class. I dropped out and I asked the department of the chair. The chair heard from the professor told me to zoom in the class. IT WAS NOT TRUE. Also, I didn't know that the professor told all classmates allowed to use Zoom EXCEPT me.

I guess it was a part of discrimination. I couldn't take the course and lost my time in the semester. Also, I lost my opportunity to graduate.

I expected to study in school, but I feel not really good. And the teacher is teaching so far.",college,Discrimination in a university,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/rphi28/discrimination_in_a_university/,1640606873.0
314,lizardpenman,1640370161,/r/college/comments/rnrufp/just_need_some_unbiased_opinions/,"I live in New York, I'm 32-years-old, and I live off of Disability benefits. I dropped out of high school because I have severe anxiety, depression, and inattentive ADHD along with other problems. I was awarded disability in 2017, but I got my GED in 2019 because I have no intentions of remaining on Disability for the rest of my life. I was also assaulted in 2019 and developed agoraphobia, which I am just now recovering from. 

After I got my GED, I enrolled in community college. The ""better"" college said I could not be accepted because I got my GED via the NEPD program and had no test scores to go off of. The NEPD program is a program that allows GED students to bypass the GED exam, given that they are able to complete a series of assignments like essays and math/science exams at a passing high school grade level. So I had to start out with community college first, which I was perfectly okay with. Until I started taking classes. 

I'm not trying to sound super pretentious, but I was disgusted with the fact that I was in an English class that involved no reading. Because, according to the instructor, it was really a writing class which was why she used the 2012 Avengers movie trailer as an example of good storytelling. And my history teacher had no idea what animism or Paganism was while he was trying to teach us the history of ancient Egypt. I know I sound like an asshole, but I was seriously worried about the quality of education I was getting and whether or not it was worth pursuing considering I'd gotten better education from Netflix and the local library. 

Again, I'm not trying to sound pretentious. I just read a lot and watch a lot of documentaries. I've devoted myself to studying certain subjects on my own ever since I was young after I realized they weren't in the school curriculums. I don't consider myself a genius. Just....... Reasonably educated on those subjects. Idk. I know I sound like a pretentious asshole. 

I'm sorry for that. 

Anyway, I decided to leave school after I began developing tension headaches on a daily basis because in class. 

Then today, I received a letter in the mail from the school asking me to come back for spring semester to avoid academic probation. And I really don't know what I want to do here. I've realized that part of the reason college is important to me is because I romanticized the idea of big university, academic settings. I really enjoyed watching the Gilmore Girls growing up and other things that were just completely unrealistic in that sense. The other reason is because of the stigma against disabled people, especially people like me with invisible disabilities. My own mother has said that I'm a burden to society and people who suffer from mental illnesses are expected to just......Suck it up and keep going, and get a job like a good little worker bee. And the last reason is so I can pursue my pipe dream of becoming an author. Or, at least, a career that involves books. 

But I also just.........Idk. Life is stressful enough with worrying about test scores and essays. I've only just managed to figure out how public transportation works again after two years of agoraphobia. That being said, I would feel better about myself if I were to graduate. And going to school would be better for my anxiety and agoraphobia in the long run -- shock therapy and all that. I know from experience that it works. 

I didn't leave school because of my anxiety. I left the school because I felt like the quality of education I was getting. Because my history professor stood up in front of us and admitted we were watching a video on ancient India that he hadn't even bothered to fact check. And I just don't know what to do. 

If anyone can offer some input that'd be great.

I dropped this class a year ago the semester after the pandemic started. Got a low score on my first exam. I decided to drop because I had a lot going on and very weak vector calculus. I was trying to work through Purcell/Morin’s “Electricity and Magnetism, 3rd edition” book, and I was bogged down by some of the complexities. It assumed you knew vector calculus. I ended up acing my multivariable calculus class that semester, and doing decently in my other classes. In Spring 2021, I took a class in ordinary differential equations, and applied linear algebra. During the summer, I worked through the textbook Purcell and Morin, I didn’t do the problems but I’ve read every chapter save for two. I will work through Purcell/Morin completely in the future. I also read parts of a couple of other books, such as Electromagnetism by Grant and Phillips and Electromagnetism for Engineers by P Hammond. I highly recommend all of these books. I also read the book “A Student’s Guide to Maxwell’s Equations” by Daniel Fleisch. I recommend anyone studying EM to read that book and do all the problems. I finished it in about four days; it’s very readable and digestible. 

My grades for the exams were 

Exam 1: 107/99
Exam 2: 115/100
Final: 69/100 (only needed 12% to keep an A so I only did part of the exam)

Had I done all of my homework I may have been able to avoid the final altogether.

I intend to go further in my studies of mathematics to truly understand the electromagnetic field. Currently reading some proof based linear algebra and vector calculus, building up to tensor analysis.

There are many many good electromagnetism books, I’m finding that textbooks are much more wholesome than lectures. Next on my list is “Practical Electromagnetics” by Misra. I want to make a solutions manual. 

I think the main thing that bogged me and many other students down is mathematical maturity. I recently have been sort of helping friends out with physical chemistry. Having good mathematical maturity makes things a lot easier and is a prerequisite for higher study. In the process of reading textbooks and just looking in my own school library, I’ve realized the sheer amount of shit I don’t know and the sheer amount of stuff that they don’t even teach in classes at my school.

TL;DR: My two friends from high school are both undecided and in completely different situations, and I feel like if they aren’t guided now they will be wasting lots of time and money on college.

So I, 18M, go to University X. I have a friend, 18M, that also goes to University X, and a friend, 18M, that goes to University Y (very close). I want to preface this story by saying that I am very comfortable right now in college, about to have a 4.0 semester in STEM and premed. I am completely fine, which is why I have no idea what I would do in my friends’ situations.

My friend that goes to University X originally intended to be an architecture major. He seemed to really like the idea of it, and we have other friends in the architecture major so he wouldn’t really be alone. For some reason, two weeks into school, he went to his advisor in hopes of changing a class and ended up going completely undecided. His schedule sucked for the entire semester, and we barely saw each other unless we made plans on the weekend. He also plans on going undecided next semester as well. When I asked him why he did this, he said it’s because he doesn’t really like anything. I asked him if he would be interested in every major under the sun that I knew of, but he just said no. He seems completely uninterested in attending or going to college, but at the same time he wants a degree. 

My friend that goes to University Y, on the other hand, began his tenure there as a music major. However, a week before finals, he dropped out and did not even take any finals at all. He only told his parents and didn’t consult any of his friends before making the decision. When he finally dropped out, I heard from a completely separate friend who attends University X, and I have still not spoken to him about the matter. He said the reasoning was that music was more of a hobby than a career, but I still disagree with the decision because he didn’t take any finals or get credit, which is a waste of money. Apparently, he is planning on transferring to University X next semester and also going undecided. I have not yet asked him about what he likes to do.

So, given the situation I have, what does anyone think the best course of action would be? While one friend has no interest in anything, the other one is still yet to be interrogated. I was personally thinking of hosting an intervention and hopefully at least help them go in the right direction. Again, I want to help them because I can tell if nothing gets decided, they will end up wasting a ton of money.",college,In Need of Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/retjeq/in_need_of_advice/,1639347614.0

I basically told her that I would think about it, but that I was about to take some time away from school and then took a tear and a half off to work full time. I decided I was ready to go back into school winter semester, in Jan 2020, and took the two classes that I had failed, and it went really great, so I decided I was back to community college for good, and to transfer to university after. This time I was going to major in bio, I loved psych but it was really only the physiological stuff that I cared about, and I had taken IB bio and chem in hs and really lived both subjects so it made sense. Spring semester started out really well as a bio major, I took bio, chem, a math class, and two history classes because I had some electives. All of my classes were great and I fell absolutely in love with science, and I had three semesters left to graduate and transfer. Until the last few weeks of school where two things happened:  First a friend from high school who knew that I was transferring but didn’t know when messaged me telling me that her roomate was moving out after this semester if I was looking for somewhere to live near the state school that I was interested in. Then my school was shut down for COVID and all of my classes were moved online indefinitely. I wanted to live with my friend and didn’t want to go through my bio classes online, because I had historically had trouble with online classes, so I came up with a new plan. I talked to an advisor at school about covering all of my gen eds for when I transferred by changing my major, confirmed that my school was going to be online next semester, and did the math and found that if I took a heavy summer and fall course load I could complete a history associates by the end of the year because of the classes that I had taken previously. The classes that I would take for my history major would cover all og my gen ed classes for university, leaving only my major requirements once I transferred. Finally I emailed my old history prof, the one who suggested that I change my major and told her my plan; I was going to change my major to history to finish all of my gen ed requirements, then change my major to bio once I transferred to university. I asked her to be my advisor and she agreed, and told me that she was excited that I was back and recommended some history classes that she thought I would like. I chugged through the summer, moved in with my friend in September, and finished my community college degree by taking 20 credits over zoom 120 miles away. Everything went great, and I transferred without a hitch. My new advisor at my uni told me that I was only a few classes away from a major in history and suggested that I double major, so I took a few bio requirements and some upper level history classes. That was when things started getting rocky again, mostly because I had some sudden financial problems and paying the rent was taking precedence over school, so I didn’t really think anything of it when my grades were a little lower than they had been before even though I had a lighter work load. Over the summer I decided to drop my history major and focus on bio, because I didn’t want to take the extra semester that it would take for me to fit all of my requirements in and  that was the plan all along anyways. So this semester it was all bio stuff; a couple bio classes, ochem, physics. And I hated it. I love science, I really do, the material that we covered in my classes was amazing, but suddenly for the first time it was like no matter how smart I was there was someone smarter than me, no matter how hard I worked there was someone working harder. My grades weren’t horrible, and I’ve come back from worse before, but they weren’t great either. And the thing is I could get better at it, or I could get through school by saying “Cs get degrees” bc I’m not trying to get into med school or anything, but the thing is I actually miss my history classes. And I think I want to change my major back to history. Which is a problem. I finally reached the first finish line, everything was supposed to get easier from here, I could put my nose to the ground and do the work that I’ve been trying to be able to do for years and I don’t even want to do it anymore. Maybe it’s finals week getting to me but even then, I think about finals week this year and being stressed and feeling stupid and trying to force ideas into my brain and then about finals week last year and working hard to finish papers and accomplishing something. The other problem with it is that realistically, a bio degree is going to actually get me a job. My parents have finally stopped asking me what I’m going to do when I graduate, because I know what I’m going to do when I graduate. If I change my major back to history then my options are a lot more limited. I would also have to break the news to my parents that I’m switching back, which I doubt they would be particularly happy about but I’m the one paying for school anyways so that’s more of a problem of having to explain myself. On the other hand I’m expecting that my grades will be better if I were to change my major, because I would be doing something that I’m actually good at, and I’m also pretty sure that I would actually graduate a semester earlier if I was just majoring in history rather than just majoring in biology. Basically I’m stuck between doing something that I kind of like doing with a secure future and doing something that I actually love and not knowing what the future’s going to look like, so if anyone had any advice that’d be great.

330,HeyLookNiceThrowaway,1639250103,/r/college/comments/re6m48/need_advice_stressed_and_considering_dropping_out/,"I attend a community college and have about 5 classes left before I graduate with an associates in businsess. I'm heavily considered dropping out because of overwhelming stress relating to school. I believe that I could teach myself more efficiently and effectively on my own, but I feel like I need a degree and want to experience graduate school some day.

Early in school I was considered ""gifted"" and skipped a grade but I failed almost every class in highschool and dropped out due to depression. In college I currently have a 3.9 GPA. Part of my stress comes from perfectionism and trying to maintain my GPA. This stresses me out because I feel like I need to maintain a high GPA if I want to transfer to a ""good"" college in the future. I feel like I missed my chance in high school. I never took the SAT. 

I already dropped out of college once due to stress. Now I have only been taking two classes a semester but still struggle with stress from school and the idea of graduating ""late"". For context I am nearly 25 and feel so far behind my peers. I've tried to break down the reasons for my stress as follows:

Most of my classes have been taken digitally and my experience with them has been that the teachers are practically absent and it's as if the class is fully automated. We mainly read out of a textbook and then do exercises made by some learning company like Mcgraw Hill or Norton. We have weekly discussions where most students bullshit and write responses like ""I agree!"" as part of a participation grade. Students do not really reach out to each other, there are no study groups or anything like that. Powerpoints slides are pre-prepared by these companies and nearly every exam question is copy pasted from Google. I wish I was in an environment where the teachers and students were more active.

When I don't understand something, there isn't anyone I can ask for help. Google isn't always reliable and for someone who doesn't understand the material figuring it out on your own can be a very long and frustrating process. Something that takes me an hour of googling could be answered in a few minutes by a teacher, and often what I find online doesn't match the format of my assignment. Most teachers write back by email in a few days, the response time is far too slow to learn effectively. 

I also don't like the way some information is presented and sometimes get stuck when I can't understand it. Because most lessons build on knowledge previously learned, this is a recipe for repeated frustration when I come across something requiring knowledge that I did not fully understand the first time.

I'm also very disappointed in the level of organization of my teachers. It is very common for assignments to have incorect dates posted, typos, and missing submission links.

I'm stuck and overwhelmed. I'm trying to hold out thinking that I might get a better education/learning experience at a better college but I don't know if that will be the case.

I am a senior in college currently. I will be graduating next Monday. I have a double major in English and Experimental Psychology. 

I’m not too sure what to do about this issue. I’ve been taking a Realism class for my English degree. Throughout the entire semester I have maintained an A in the class. 

Yesterday, I opened my transcript to see a B as my final grade for the class. I immediately emailed my professor and let her know I was showing an A on the class website, but a B on my transcript. My school also offers a B+, so I was confused as to how my grade could drop so drastically on the last day of class. 

My professor emailed me back to let me know she gave me a 70 on participation. I have only missed 3 classes (the allowed amount), and I have turned in all of my work. I also make it a point to speak in every class. I emailed her back asking to have a meeting about how my participation dropped so low. 

The issue I’m having in believing I earned this grade lies in the fact that I received great feedback on each assignment, and I constantly spoke in class. Also, the day before class ended she asked me what my name was when passing out assignments, which makes me believe she hasn’t been writing credit next to my name for my participation throughout the semester. I believe she is trying to manipulate grades to represent a Bell curve (it is common at the college level). 

While this may seem insignificant, I am trying to graduate with the highest honors due to the fact that I will be applying to a very prestigious graduate program. This one B will pull my GPA down to where I only graduate with Magna Cum Laude. I also have a 4.0 in all of my classes for both majors (math classes are my only Bs, so my major GPAs are both 4.0).

What should I do? She has ignored my request for a meeting, so I’m unsure where to go from here.

The past few weeks it has spiralled completely out of control and it feels like I have 0 control over my school and work related responsibilities.

I took a year and a half after high school while working full time to finally start college for an associates at a local community College. This is my first semester. I was doing pretty good the first quarter of the semester, then grades plummeted. Starting losing motivation and decided it wasn't for me. I started skipping my 3/4 of my classes (except one, because for some reason I liked this one class). 

Ended up dropping one of my classes on the deadline and wished I dropped the rest because now I'm failing all except one due to not doing the assignments. Just missed a giant essay and completely missed an exam (not final).  I really have 0 motivation to even attend the finals at this point because the semester ends soon, and feel really really guilty about my lack of effort, and it's starting to cause anxiety thinking about it that I never had before.

I have changed my major/minor multiple times but every time I get further into taking the courses required, I run into problems and am too dumb to understand anything. I have (read: had) aspirations of going to law or business school but with the rate at which things are going now, it seems like I can kiss those dreams goodbye.

I'm 26, with two young kids, and im poor. I live with my grandparents and have since 2018. I've been in and out of college for close to 8 years now and feel so stupid for not having a degree by now. I've been to tons of different colleges. 2 or 3 community colleges and the same university twice now. If I can finish my associates in May like planned, I'll be going to the university for the third time. 

The reason it's taken me so long is 1.) Having young kids who aren't both in school really is a distraction. 2.) My mental state in the past couple years has been awful. I've suffered from moderate-severe depression and tons of anxiety about not having a major. I go from being very confident in having chose a major and then I switch it or completely drop out. I've dropped out probably 3 times or ""taken breaks"". Whatever you wanna call it.

Another issue is that I can't figure out what's even worth getting a degree in. Literally EVERY single thing I'm interested in, im told is a waste of time and I don't need a degree to do it. For instance, I love writing. I was thinking of doing a journalism or creative writing degree. Possibly English because I'm passionate about all of those. I'm told it's worthless and I won't find a job. Criminal justice was another idea. Again, worthless apparently. Library science. Worthless. I could go on. Seems like no matter what I chose to do, I'm going to question its validity in finding an actual job. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm losing interest in everything I once really enjoyed. 

I'm already writing too much and no one will probably read this far. My main question is, what can I get a degree in 2 years or so, make okay to good money, can support two kids with, provides medical insurance, and something I can retire doing. Also does it require a degree or not? Is college really worth it when you're so indecisive and have no direction in life?

And a month later, I got a not-so-good grade and an admission letter from HKUSPACE.

College life is fascinating at the beginning, everything is new. Of course, I'm extremely excited and wanna try everything, from making new friends to participating in after-school activities, you know that feeling when you're finally free from the pressure that everyone forces you to get into college, find a good job and have a perfect life? (Especially if you're Asian) That's how I felt for the first month I got into college: The freedom, the independence and everything.

But later I realized that college life isn't as great as I expected. I got a shitty irresponsible professor that doesn't even understand the main topic of the course, so he just downloads PowerPoint from the Internet and put his name at the end of the presentation. I got tons of assignments from 5 different courses each week and I had to stay up every night to finish the essay, report and other stuff. I got 2 bad groupmates that didn't do anything for the group project, never shows up at the group meeting, and turns out that all of them dropped out of college, so I had to do everything myself. My only friend in college also dropped out because he wanted to retake the HKDSE and go to a better college.

And the thing is, the campus isn't that bad, the facility over here is great, clean environment, beyond my expectation actually. It's the people here are shit, nobody pays attention to the class, because the students are either too smart that they don't even need to listen to the class, or they are way too bad that they can't even understand a single word the professor says. So eventually fewer and fewer people come to class, can you imagine that there are only 6 students who came to class today? And there are about 30 students enrolled in this course!

I really want to research the brain and give people treatments, diagnose people, or even possibly become a neurologist. If I get to med school and like something like ED medicine, I'd give that a shot, too. 

In my CC, I became an active leader/community member. I made a diversity position at the SGA and created a community service group. Together, we've logged a few thousand hours, primarily working with the unhoused. In my early 20s, I was unhoused.

After that, I became a registrar in the ER (in 2020), and volunteered over the summer, signing people up to get their covid shots and assisting as a ""third hand"" for nurses. I've had a lot of one-on-one patient experience. 

However, I feel like I am at a crossroads. Nothing is looking good for any med school application. I have several W's in CC, all for different reasons. 

I came out of CC with a 3.8. In my 4 yr, despite my best efforts, last semester I got a 3.2. This was after I sacrificed all of my free time, and dropped o-chem for the first time. I incurred more W's (up to 6 now) and my GPA is sinking. I'm on track for a 2-point-something, despite the fact that I'm throwing everything I have at these classes.

I've transferred in and I'm technically a ""junior"" about to become a ""senior"" next semester. I don't have any research and I haven't even met with a pre-med advisor. They have a ""mandatory seminar"" you must attend before you can see somebody. The next seminar is in December. 

I do very well in bio and psych but extremely poorly in math. My degree has a lot of math and chemistry requirements. Supposedly physics is required for med school, too. I can get C's in these classes but I can't make the A's I need to be a competitive candidate. These classes are all huge and taught very poorly and are extremely unforgiving. If you miss a class, it affects your grade. I commute, so its not always easy for me to be on campus. I made the mistake of coming to my state flagship university. It is not a commuter's campus, and it is not transfer or non-trad friendly. Looking at the demographics, only 4% of their students are transfers.

I don't have any research experience like I'm supposed to have. I'm tempted to switch to psych, but if I wanted to go to grad school, I would have had some hours down for research by now. I'm so swamped with my overwhelming studies that I can't even fathom trying to shove anything else into my schedule right now.  I even quit my ER job, which I love. 

Every bit of my free time is at use in school. I don't exercise anymore, I rarely sleep right. My mental health is on a sharp and horrible decline. I need to ask questions one-on-one, and that is just so impossible in a class full of hundreds. I need more tutoring help. Free tutoring isn't available here. I'm running out of money and options. When I try to teach myself in things like math or o-chem, I get the first step wrong and everything else is wrong. If I just had the answer and someone to reach out to, I could do better.

We also have groupmes in the classes and Idk what good they are. I will ask for help or notes and get crickets in response. Idk if its just a premed culture thing. People have cliques and groups. Because I'm older, and non-trad, I find myself on the outside of them, nearly everytime. 

The other day I mentioned my age to a couple of students in passing. Like, people I spoke to for weeks, I mentioned my age, and they got weird and distant (I'm 28). I also recently made the mistake of telling someone my age in the first couple of exchanges, and told me the age gap was ""too weird"" for us to be friends.

Got in again in 2019 and I didn't like my university. Applied for a scholarship in one of the best private universities of my country and after the longest examinations I got in with a scholarship in Chemical Engineering and started studying in 2020.

I was never particularly good in Math, Physics or Chemistry. Just did enough to get by and sometimes I was able to get a high grade. Most of what I know now I learned in the last 4 months because I failed Calculus I and had to study everyday to pass it during the summer.

My dad died in April 9th, and 10 days later I had to star the spring trimestre. I had no chance to grieve properly and my mental health plumeted. I didn't care about classes. That's why I failed Calculus and learnt almost nothing of Chemistry.

But not everything was bad, when I passed Calculus i felt like I could actually do engineering and that it wasn't that bad.

Fast forward to today's date and I'm struggling with every class, I have no study method or discipline. I realized I don't like what I'm studying, I feel horrible everytime I'm in class and even have had some panic attacks due to how wasteful I feel i am being with my time.

He wasn't a close friend, and I didn't think much of it at the time. He was around for my first year, and after that, he was just... gone. At the start of my second year, there was a dorm room near mine marked with his name. But days, then weeks, then months went by, and I never saw him or heard from him. I never saw anyone enter or leave that room. That sign with his name was left up for almost the entire year.

I'd forgotten about him until recently. One day, I randomly remembered and decided to Google his name. I assumed he dropped out and went off to do something else. I was interested, since this guy was damn accomplished, in both academics and sports.

What I found was kind of eerie, and I don't know what to think of it. There are plenty of Google hits for him... for high school and his first year of college. After that, the hits abruptly end, and there's no mention of him for the next several years.

I have no reason to think he died, or became a missing persons case. My school would notify students when this happened; it actually happened with a person I knew who died in a freak accident last year. Nothing on Google suggests this guy died. But now I'm wondering what the hell happened. He dropped out and went dark? He had a Facebook account, and we were friended, but as far as I can tell it doesn't exist anymore.

5 years ago, when I was 22, I remember having a zest for life that set the wheels in motion of where I am today. I did like, 20 hours/wk of martial arts, worked a part-time blue collar job, and I was such a badass. I loved life. I got outside, into the sunlight, rode a bike, jogged, and travelled. I decided to go back to school when FASFA would allow me to go back as an independent, to get a four-year, and make a career in the sciences or research. I really wanted to research BCIs, or mental health treatments, or something with the brain. 

So far, the first two years went by real smooth. I became a leader in a lot of clubs and was a runner-up for the board of trustees. I represented the college on a congressional level and became the student chair of diversity. I also arranged a club for community volunteering and we logged thousands of hours together. I became an ABA therapist for a while, then left, and got a job in the emergency room over the summer, that I worked for a year and a half, and had to recently quit because of the oppressive workload I have now. On top of that, I made straight-A's, and was pretty much auto-admitted to my first choice university. 

The school I'm attending is a state flagship school and has ripped all of my self-esteem away. I thought  that in being an older student I would have a distinguished work-ethic and worldliness. Despite all of my best efforts and work, everything has been a nearly-passing mess, and all of the grading methods have been infantilizing, arbitrary and questionable.  I feel really un-keen, slightly overweight and slower compared to everyone else,  and kind of pathetic in my academic comprehension and understanding of expectations.  

My first semester at this school was last semester (Spring 2020), and I took a lab. This means everything was completely virtual, and everyone was completely alone. They were operating under the expectation that everyone had taken labs here before, and that they must be written in pen. I was unaware of this, I was also unaware that I was supposed to write procedures, reagents and a 2-page-report after each lab. We had to submit two labs at once, because one was skipped on Labor Day. I got back  my first grade for the first three labs and they were all 0's, forcing me to drop the lab. I had also no feedback that I was supposed to do these labs in pen. I was also barely passing a math class (notoriously the hardest class in the university) and the hardest science class in the university. I was making all A's in my previous college. No other grades were turned in and all of the auto-quiz grades gave me 40 and 50%s before a professor came along and made them 60s% and 70%s.  So I remember sitting there, the first month of my next college, with F's and 0's all over my dashboard. 

After a blow to my self-esteem and a death in the family that caused me to miss my first set of midterms, I reached out to my professors and began asking for help. They told me that I didn't have a university excused absence, and that the exams would take place at the same time throughout the semester. One let me take the missed exam on the day of the final, but that was it. I dropped from B to C, and ruined my chances ( I feel) of getting into grad school. A 2.1 is unacceptable and things aren't looking up. I feel like I might fail out of the university (if I drop below 2.0). They had a two ""P"" limit, and I used up that limit, and still had a pathetic GPA. 

I thought about this and I think about it often. How mercy was a constant theme throughout the pandemic, how an attitude of graciousness was espoused. My first impression of the university was just not great. I immediately wanted to drop out and just work for 30k for the rest of my life. I feel like I'm a terribly bad fit for this university, and it is bringing out the worst in me. I feel like I am failing and begging, in survival mode, and the idea of being a leader or volunteer like I was at my last school feels so impossible. 

The second round of mid-terms, I think, are putting me on a path to permanent failure. I've been so depressed from the abuse and mistreatment of this university that I feel sick whenever I open up the ELMS ticker or read the endless hours of course content. I took the mid-terms in a serious state of depression and haze, and the experience was like falling off of a horse, still attached to it by a rope, and it continued to drag my face through the gravel to the finish line. 

Every semester is the same. I start off semi-strong with my routine and hobbies intact. I make all A's on the assignments, then the first midterm comes and I squeeze past a passing grade. I have to stop exercising, stop cooking, stop all free-time activities, just to hunker down and make sure I don't meet the same fate I did in semester one. Despite my hard work, I just fail the second round of mid-terms and get a 2nd wind just in time to barely pass the third. Despite my hours of reading and working and endless writing (I have thumb arthritis from working so hard from this school), I barely make a passing grade. I'm too depressed to ask for a regrade. I feel like because each TA is in charge of hundreds of us, they just round us down to the average grade, to keep things simple, and I honestly wonder if I have been completely cheated out of a fair GPA. My friends who went to private schools with a smaller student-to-teacher ratio tell me this kind of thing happens all the time, and I probably have. 

I am so depressed and a couple of weeks ago, I reached out for help from my university counseling center. I considered taking my own life. I've filled out 7 intake forms for two different places and three counselors/doctors/coordinators and they've just asked me the same questions that the intake forms asked. I'm sitting here, three weeks later, after applying for help and I haven't been seen therapeutically yet or have even been talked to or been treated by a single therapy session. 

I feel like they just wanted to grab my number, say that I have been treated, and not get me any help. Its good for PR, after all. 

My life feels really unstable at this point and I could be dropped out next year or laid out next year. I go into every semester with hard work and open communication to my professors, but I'm so afraid to approach them for help, even the outwardly outgoing ones, because I feel like there's a good chance they'll tell me to kick rocks. I feel such a sharp decline in my sense of self and i feel like I am floating through life.

I've had lots of mood swings this fall, I'm a sophomore in community college taking all online classes. Back in September, I was feeling very lonely, I didn't think I'd want the college experience since I liked being alone back in HS. Last month, I realized that I don't know what I want socially once I would transfer to a 4 year school next year. I think I would like partying and spending lots of time with people, but I realize it's totally possible that I'm just romanticizing the college experience because of my current situation, and might not like those things as much as I think right now.

I was actually in a much better mood last school year, I didn't think at all about the college experience, I just focused on enjoying myself during my free time and doing well in my classes.

Lately, I've been falling behind in my classes and have been feeling stressed about my grades, I came to CC hoping to get much better grades than I did in HS, since back then they were all over the place.

I also dropped a 4 credit math class, bringing me down from 19 credits to 15 (I knew it was a crazy amount, but I didn't think I would be as distracted as I've been this fall so far). 

My sleep schedule has also been very irregular, and I'm highly dependent on sleep meds so I'm sure that's part of it.

I would fluctuate between being in a very bad mood, feeling lonely thinking about how I'm at home and online at CC while almost all other schools are fully in person with lots of students having vibrant social lives, partying and living their best lives, and the possibility of not getting into good colleges because my fall grades would turn out bad; to being in a very good mood, confident or hopeful that my hard work will pay off giving me good grades, and not feeling lonely at all, remembering that I lots of ways to enjoy being by myself and that I don't want a social life right now, since I should be busy with school and looking at schools for transferring.

Short history: I went to a preparatory high school, had excellent grades and SAT scores and got admitted to a high ranking US university honors program. Due to depression and video game addiction I fucked that off super bad, scored a 1.75 gpa my first year and then dropped out, leaving with 15 grand in debt. After one more year of being an utter degenerate I discovered Jordan Peterson's work, started working out and reading a lot and started working heavy construction installing windows on high rise buildings. At the construction place and by teaching myself PLC troubleshooting which I do on the weekends I have been able to pay off the debts and save up over 80k.

Now I am starting to go crazy from the monotony / lack of challenge in these lines of work and I have developed an interest in the field of economics/game theory, specifically building models to test and compare the effectiveness of various forms of philanthropy and social programs. The more I learn about this (autodidactically for the time being) the more every minute working at the other jobs feels duller and duller by comparison.

I want to go to the best program I can when I return to school but I have the 1.75 gpa from my previous fuck-up. That was 5 years ago and I have matured immensely since then. If I enroll at a junior college and do one year of classes in CS/Econ can I apply to a university using those grades and basically just trash the transcripts from my first attempt at university? I don't want to transfer those credits anyway because the classes I did pass I completely bullshitted my way through without learning the core concepts so I want to retake them.

My parents sent me to a private Christian school afterwards to convert me and eventually disowned me. I lost my only friends from a tragic accident. I left my home country alone to pursue my education.

With zero opportunities to seek mental health counseling, years of depression and countless suicide attempts, and working day and night while studying full time to financially support myself, I am finally drained.

I worked so hard day and night because I wanted to survive and hopefully find a better life. However, I was never given a chance to shine ever in my life. Although I graduated my high school with 4.40 GPA (highest), I was not chosen as a valedictorian because I was against ""school's policy"" (according to the principal's office secretary). In fact, I did not even know  I was supposed to be a valedictorian because no one ever told me. I learned this recently when I was applying for transfer admission, and my high school's updated transcript clearly said I had the highest ranked student. That's how I found out, but it was too late.

Since I could barely afford a 4-year education, I went to a community college. I was a straight-A student with a 4.0 GPA. I applied for almost 45 scholarships that I could find from weeks of research, but I was never given a chance for even a dollar grant because I was ineligible for FAFSA. Seeing all my friends receiving financial aid and even withdrawing checks because apparently school ""owes"" them money, my life felt so miserable.

I eventually transferred to one of the UCs with a Regents Scholarship, but my school dropped this after I deferred my enrollment due to Covid pandemic. The admissions and the scholarship offices promised me that this scholarship would roll over for the next year, but they shared me the wrong information due to their own mistakes, so I am paying almost $70k per year w/o any grants, FA, nor financial help from anyone.

I worked harder than anyone, but seeing life being so unfair ever since I was born (not to mention all the struggles I had to go through as a gay person living in a very conservative environment), I am finally drained. I do not see a point of living when there has not been a single opportunity for ""reward"" (not necessarily financial ones) nor there ever will be. I can't stop thinking about depressing and bad thoughts, and I feel like I am finally done. No family, no hope, and no future. I wish I was never born.

Basically the only family member I have, my grandmother, doesn’t support me at all. She’s never proud of me for how hard I have been working in school or my grades or anything I do really. I have a good job that I love even though it takes a lot out of me, I’m getting all A’s in my classes, and I take care of her full time. She acts like all of this is nothing? As if it’s easy to have these 3 huge responsibilities on my shoulders at all times. She has one other grandchild (my cousin) who is… not a good person and has not been very good to her, yet she thinks he’s the best thing since sliced bread. She praises the crap out of him for doing nothing. He dropped out of HS, has never had a job or future plans to do anything even at the age of 22, he lies to her to take money from her, etc. Yet she talks to him in ways that she doesn’t talk to me. She’s soft and caring and encouraging. When she speaks to me, it’s usually to verbally abuse me or talk down to me.

I know most people will say that as long as I’m proud of myself, that should be what matters. I’m very proud of myself. I suffered for years getting bad grades through HS and early college because of untreated mental illness, having to take care of her while also taking care of my drug addicted mother, and just trying to survive. I’ve worked hard and I know I deserve these good grades now. But it hurts when I get excited to tell her about a good grade or getting good feedback at work and she gives me a short answer as if I’m the most unimportant person to her. 

Anyone have any advice on how to accept the fact that I may be the only person who is ever proud of me? Or how to accept that I will most likely continue to not get support or recognition from her even though I desperately crave her approval because she’s been my only real parental figure/caretaker since I was in first grade?",college,How do you deal with unsupportive family?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ql9djh/how_do_you_deal_with_unsupportive_family/,1635892031.0

It didn't help that my major was Computer Science. I struggled a lot in my coding class and I ended up relying on a friend to help me with the exercises. For my calculus class, I failed it the first time. I said alright, lemme just re-take it next semester.

I once again was doing horribly in my calc class and there I decided that I would switch majors.

Of course, I knew switching majors meant I would graduate late, that wasn't my problem, the issue was the cost. My mother is supporting me by paying out of pocket because I'm not eligible for financial aid, and at first I was scared to tell her but I knew it was better to tell her now than later.

So after that, I switched from Computer Science to Computer Information Systems and because of that, most of my classes were fall through. I dropped my coding class and just tonight, I decided to drop my calc class as well since I'm near the edge of failing.

I’m looking for some advice.

I have a class where 1/5 of the grade is class participation, which is up solely to the digression of the instruction. Knowing what I know now, I should have dropped, but I didn’t think he was as unreasonable as he is. 

The class is the easiest course in the world, but I just show up and do my work, turn in it on time or a day early.

He regularly tells the class what an “over achiever” I am, so for the group project he paired me with the two most absent people. The project went ok, but now with the project and the participation grade, I’m nervous. 

I always got the feeling that he would give me a B, for no other reason than spite. He’s extremely passive aggressive. He will only reprimand the people he doesn’t like, while ignoring the same actions from those he likes. Her implicit bias is off the charts and sadly, I’m fair sure he doesn’t like me.

To make matters worse, I tried talking to my parents about this and one of the things that bothered me was a response that, “Well a B isn’t the end of the world.” While I know he’s right, I wanted to save the B’s for courses that were actually difficult, or thing that I really couldn’t comprehend.

It’s having a negative impact on my drive and motivation. I’ve worked so hard to get A’s this semester, but if a B is something I can’t avoid, should I just be happy with B’s my other classes too?

375,Gold-Ad1657,1634925898,/r/college/comments/qdmmmh/thinking_about_attending_college_to_become_a_sign/,"I am 24 years old and I have been fascinated by American sign language for as long as I can remember. When I was 18 years old, I applied at Miami Dade College so I could start the 2 year Associate program. I was struggling with mental illness severely at that age, I let it control my life, and I decided to put it off. Fast forward 6 years later, I'm still struggling with mental illness but I'm taking steps to not let it control my life anymore. 

I want to mention that I grew up taking gifted/advanced classes but because my mental illness was so severe, and I let it take control, I dropped out sophomore year of highschool. I attended a GED program at Miami Dade college, got my highschool diploma that way, and graduated earlier than all my peers. My certification literally says ""highschool diploma"". A lot of people give me a hard time because they don't believe a GED is the same thing as a highschool diploma, so that's why I said that.

Anyways, I now live in Jacksonville, Fl and I'm looking to start in FSCJ to get an Associate degree in sign language interpretation. I do have some reservations about doing this though. First, I am very shy/ socially anxious. I wasn't always like this. Due to experiencing trauma over the course of my life, I have become much more reserved but I'm currently doing therapy to overcome my social anxiety. I have noticed that to be a sign language interpreter you need to have good social skills, be very friendly, and be okay with public speaking. That's something I need to work on.

Second, although I grew up in gifted classes, I did not do well in school. I have a lot of insecurities about my intelligence. I had a lot of learning anxiety, fear of failure, fear of looking stupid. I don't think this means that I'm not intelligent or bright, I think it just means that I allowed my anxiety to really get in the way of learning anything. I was more anxious of how I was coming across to others, to my teachers and having performance anxiety. I had a really hard time focusing as well (I've been diagnosed with ADD) and I still do now.

 I want to be able to overcome this. Because I do have a hard time learning, I was thinking of doing school part time, if that's even possible? I will start working full time soon and I think doing school part time will be less taxing on my mental health. I don't know how anything college related works. Credits, semesters, financial aid... I don't understand much about how to get started at college at all, so if any of you would like to help in that regard I would really appreciate it.

* To make this short, I want to get an Associate degree for sign language interpretation. I do have reservations about it because of my mental illnesses, not having been to school in 6 years (and not having done well in school), and not really knowing about how to get started at a community college, how the credits work, how financial aid works, and if I could even do it part time although it would take me much longer to complete.

Students make a list of programs they'd like to enroll in, and they get into a program based on their exam performance. 

I graduated from high school in May 2020. I'd known for a while that I wanted to study chemistry. When making my list of programs, I found out that one of the top universities in my country was offering a chemistry program in English. I thought this would be beneficial to me in the future to get further education and to work abroad. Therefore, I put it at the top of my list, and got in with a full scholarship.  

Only 2 other students got into this program. Chemistry isn't very popular here I guess. It was really weird to have only 2 classmates, but we got along and it was fine for a while. Then, last semester, one of my classmates dropped out. Now there's only 2 of us left. Today, my remaining classmate texted me that she's also thinking about changing her major, because chemistry is making her miserable. Hearing this gave a bit of a panic attack (lol), but obviously, I can't force her to stay. I talked to my advisor, who said he doesn't know what the administration will decide.

I'm at a loss. They could close the program, in which case I will have to transfer and continue studying in my native language. This is a problem, because the curricula are wildly different and I could be looking at an extra year of study (which will cost money that I don't have). If they don't close the program, I will be the only one in most of my classes. I don't know if I could handle such a thing.

I could also transfer abroad, but unless I get a scholarship (which is unlikely), I don't have the money.

I don't even know what I'm looking for here, I just wanted to share this with someone. If you have any advice, I would really appreciate it.",college,I'm so lost,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/qaq9cl/im_so_lost/,1634592633.0

I constantly worried that he looked at me with nothing but pity bc I always mentioned how much I was struggling bc of my anxiety and how lonely I’ve been.

I previously had to drop out in my second semester at community college due to losing my job, and a few years later, I returned to school full time. I’m now in my fourth semester (final semester in the spring) and I am struggling. My first semester back to school, I did really well, all As and Bs, which is great since my GPA tanked to a 2.0 when I dropped out. I’ve been trying to push myself to reach a 3.5 by graduation, and I’m only taking 16 credit hours this semester so I thought this would be attainable. I’ve even been inducted into my school’s honor society chapter, and I’m really excited about learning the material and honestly enjoy being in school again. The problem is that I feel so burnt out that I dread doing the work, and a lot of times, I just don’t have the time. It feels like all I do is study and go to work. 

I work 30-35 hours a week on average at my PT job, and I don’t make enough money to support myself right now, and honestly, I need to work less to be able to spend more time on my coursework, but that just isn’t in the cards for me at the moment. On top of financial problems and a lack of time, I have a chronic pain disability that also requires me to have more sleep than the average college student, like I actually need 8 hours of sleep to function - so pulling all-nighters makes me physically ill and more in pain than usual, and I just can’t seem to find enough time in the day to do the same amount of work I used to do while working 40+ hours per week. 

Do you guys have any tips that can help me stay on track and motivated?

There is an unsettling number of them that have opened up to me about how bad their mental health is right now due to the stress they are under from their classes. Today, a girl told me how she spent the last two weeks in a psychiatric facility because of how bad her stress has been. She told me how she’s been vomiting every morning due to her fear of failing, as well as considering hurting herself so she wouldn’t be able to go to class. A transfer student told me how she had a similar experience and was considering dropping out after being treated awfully by several of our professors. They talked to her as if she were a child just because she expressed how confused and stressed she was about classes. Rather than helping, they ridiculed her and made her feel as if she wasn’t welcome there. And then the other day, I saw a whole group of them bawling about how the school is changing requirements for the major and stopping people from going elsewhere for one of the more difficult classes. They had apparently told the chair that the class was too difficult for a 200 level, and he told them they don’t belong here if they can’t handle this class. Yet, this same Professor suggested I take that class elsewhere as everyone failed it. I’m just so sick of this school. The professors are incapable of showing sympathy or addressing the fact that we just came back from a really difficult period of our lives. My roommate lost both of her grandmothers to covid. One of my (genius)friends dropped out after a month when a professor told her she’d “never make it in this field”. She had missed a couple classes as her dad was in the hospital.

I am currently a second-year cadet at a state maritime academy in the deck officer program. For those that don't know, basically I go to school to learn how to drive and navigate ships and manage cargo, all the stuff a ship's mate would do. Admittedly, I dicked around a lot in my first year, much more than I should have, and I came out with an abysmal 2.14 GPA for last year. Now, this year, I'm almost halfway through, and I've definitely turned my shit all around. However, the more time I spend here, the more I worry about what if it turns out I don't enjoy this sort of life. As a mariner working on the Great Lakes (which I plan to do), I would most likely be gone 2 months at a time, with one month off in between periods of being out at sea, and then a few months' stretch between mid-January and mid-March. While this only totals to around 6-7 months of work throughout the year, and the prospective pay is pretty good for where I'm headed, part of me is terrified of what if it turns out I don't enjoy the time away. I fully intend on getting married and having a family, and I know being gone for such stretches of time can put strain on my loved ones. Now, I'll be going out on my academy's training ship come summer, and after which I can ensure I'm making the right choice here. However, I like to have a back-up plan in case this doesn't work out for me. Now, my program, while perusing my appropriate licenses, also would give me a bachelor's of science in maritime technology. However, in the back of my mind, I've always had this passion since I was a kid for aircraft, and for the longest time I always wanted to either major in aerospace engineering and/or become a pilot. I thought of going military, but I realized that isn't necessarily a lifestyle for me. 

So, would I still be able to graduate in 4 years if, say after this semester or before next fall, I dropped from the program, took gen ed courses at a community college and did online school part time while pursuing a helicopter pilot's license? The classes I have under my belt already include basic physics as well as trigonometry, and many of my maritime courses do have a heavy emphasis on mathematics. I know a degree can be beneficial even if a pilot isn't required one, and an engineering degree can be a solid fallback to the fallback should becoming a helicopter pilot not work out for whatever reason. I can't imagine taking many science and math based gen ed courses online through community college until I transfer to get an online degree would be a terrible thing, would it? 

Tl,dr: I go to school to be a commercial seaman, should I feel this isn't right for me, would it be financially and time-wise feasible for me to switch from my current 4-year program to finishing gen eds through community college online and pursue an online degree while pursuing a helicopter pilot's license since I also have a love for aviation?",college,Am I screwed if I switch to becoming a pilot instead of sailing?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/q8d7dz/am_i_screwed_if_i_switch_to_becoming_a_pilot/,1634278123.0

We worked hard for it and asked the professor several questions. But before turning in the assignment, one of my classmates had a doubt about a graph we did. So I asked one of my friends who had taken this class before, since she might know something, but instead she gave me the script they did. I used our data to run their script, but the answers were different. It was weird but we didn't think much of it and didn't change anything on our script.

The thing is that at the moment of submitting the script, I wrongfully submitted my friend's script. I didn't realise that until the professor talked to me yesterday.

She started by saying that she had already reported us since we turned in someome else's work. I immediately knew that I messed things up, so I tried to explain that we just used that script to test something we weren't sure about and that our script was completely different. Thankfully, she asked me to send her our script. But when I asked her what would happen to us (since we've been already reported), she said that we'd be dropped off from class or get a 0 for this assignment. She added that we should wait and don't withdraw from this class (idk whether she was caring for us or she wouldn't be able to punish us if we withdrew).

I'm really afraid of getting an academic sanction since I have very good grades and I'm trying to get into a prestigious grad school next year. So, I wrote an appoligizing letter to her today.

There are still somethings that favor us:
- the 2 scripts are very different (there are parts that look similar, since they were either on the scripts used in class or found online)
- we sent a mail asking several questions (with a screenshot included), and what the professor answered were well incorporated in our script
- given the same data, the answer on both scripts are different
- we didn't put our names or anything like that on my friend's script (so that's not appropiation or plagiarism)
- I sent our script to the professor right there, so there was no time to edit 

I'm really afraid how this is going to turn out, she said that she would speak to us again on Friday about the final decisions. What do you think this will turn out?

During the beginning of COVID-19, I dropped out of college twice because I have a mental impairment that really affected my ability to focus on school while living through a pandemic and working. My parents were paying for my classes back then, but since i decided I wanted to transfer to the school my girlfriend is at, they didn’t want to pay for my out of state tuition, which is totally fine and understandable. I brought up the idea to my parents and they were totally on board with the idea that I would pay my share of the rent with student loans. Flash forward to early August, days before we are set to move into our apartment, my parents decided that they weren’t going to let me take out student loans, specifically the PLUS loan, because they didn’t trust me to complete the semester and they didn’t want to have to be responsible “when I dropped out again.” I not only found this disrespectful to me, but also to my girlfriend, because we had already signed the lease. After lots of screaming by me and my parents, we eventually came to a deal; they would allow me to take out enough student loans to barely pay rent each month and nothing else. As part of the agreement, they would “hold on” to the student loan money and transfer me $500 a month for my rent. A few days ago, I decided that I was tired of being stressed all day everyday about not being able to afford groceries and whatnot, so I called my dad and I asked if we could edit the plan and take out more so that I could have enough money to pay my share of groceries and utilities. He talked to my mom about it, and now they want us to drive down and see them to talk about it this weekend. Who is in the wrong here, if anyone? My grades are better than they ever have been, and I attribute that to my wonderful girlfriend and not having the stress of a job. What can I say to them to give me my student loans?

TLDR: my parents don’t trust me to finish the semester even though I’m doing better than I ever have, and they are refusing to allow me to take out enough student loans to live on.

I graduated school in 2020 and started going to a local community college. Due to the pandemic and having a major depressive episode, I was a horrible student. I dropped out of school after my first semester. I then re-applied to a school that I applied to during high school and got in. Thinking this was my last chance at school, I enrolled in the Fall 2021 semester. I worked my ass off trying to get into this school and did my financial aid and finally got into this school. I did my school's orientation program and I immediately saw red flags. Maybe it's because I am a year older, but they were all immature and rude. But, I just wrote it off as me being judgmental and moved into school. It has been two months since then and I hate it here. I have no friends, like the only people I speak to is my boyfriend, my grandma, my cousin, and my mom. Every time I try to make friends with another girl, they roll their eyes at me or ignore me. I am also a vegetarian and there are little to no options for here, I either eat so unhealthy that my stomach hurts or I eat healthy but so little food. The school's environment wrong for me too. The school has parties, fashion shows, and rappers come there and I am not a party person. I listen to a lot of Taylor Swift, Lorde, and disco, but everyone here listening to rap, and unless it's Drake, I don't know it. I have toyed around with transferring for a second time after the school-year is over. However, I am afraid to do so for two reasons: 

1. My job eligibility: I'm a history major and I'm afraid that if I transfer schools to much no one will want to hire me.
2. My mom: I really feel like I let my mom down when I dropped out, so now that I am in school, and getting As and Bs, I am finally not a fuck up. But I feel like if I tell her that I am miserable here that I will disappoint her.

Over the last month, I’ve asked her for some help and advice since this is something I’d think she’d be at least a little interested or knowledgeable in. I get the same response without her even really listening to what I’m having trouble with. Even her tone just sounds so uninterested and dismissive.

Don’t get me wrong, I don’t expect her to help me just because I help her. I’ve never expected anything in return before. And I certainly don’t expect her to know all the answers.

I'm an alcoholic and I went to rehab a couple times and have gotten the opportunity to ""start fresh"" twice now. By that I mean I left rehab, moved into a low cost sober home, got a food service job, and had time to think about what I wanted to do next. 

This last time around in 2019 I decided to go back for an additional degree through a low cost program and with financial aid. I took to school really well and was working food service and had the time for school. 

In late 2020 once school were fully remote I decided to apply for a job that paid better and had insurance. It was a full time remote position at a major company and I took to that really well and stopped focusing on school as much, but figured I could complete my classes and work full time with both being remote. My school also went to self paced and so there were no longer live virtual classes for me to attend. 

I ended up getting a substantial promotion at work and it really became my focus. I fit in well at work and love what we are doing and my new role and feel like I am thriving. My interest in school completely dropped off. 

I should also mention my degree path is very difficult, and of the 30 that started in fall 2019 we are at about 5 remaining students. I am currently the furthest along in our program as well for what it's worth. 

Juggling these two lives has been very difficult. Even when I decide to relax after a busy day at work I always feel the looming shadow of school over my head due to the self paced nature. I procrastinate and feel awful and then have weekends full of additional work. I'm not happy with this and I constantly feel like I need to be working and it is really starting to drain me and my schoolwork is not progressing at the levels needed to truly be a professional in the field. And after all I've learned, I'm not so sure I truly want to be a professional in that field. 

I decided tonight that I am going to withdraw from the program. I will be able to pay off all my school fees and loans within the next 6 months no problem and I'm just going to walk away. 

I have no regrets. I learned a lot at school and it was really important to me for a while. It gave me ambition and a sense of purpose. I never would have known that I would land a job I was good at that paid well and get a promotion and find this new path in life so I don't feel silly quitting now. 

Going forward, I will be able to work my 40 hours and then have a normal life. I won't feel like I need to be burning the candle at both ends. I'm working too hard to be this stressed and unhappy.

They haven't brought up the other college ever, but I just remembered it randomly. When I apply to my transfer destination, do I need to include that other colleges transcript? If I do, will it wreck my GPA?

Also, the first college noticed I had dual enrollment credits from high school and wouldn't let me in without that transcript. I'm scared the 4 year Uni will see those credits and make me send in those credits and ruin my decent GPA.

411,emeyer4444,1632405922,/r/college/comments/ptvzuy/usas_vanishing_intelligence_while_the_north_pole/,"As you may know, the average IQ, compared to the previous decade, has been dropping by a few points since the 1950s. In the 1990s, the USA's education system ranked 6th in the world. By 2017, the USA had dropped to 24th in science and 38th in science.

The change in the USA's intelligence directly tracks the growth of the ""new Tea Party,""  which was formed to support President Bush's statement that college professors are 'elitist.' As the new Tea Party grew, Republican opinion on the value of intelligence flipped, such that its majority now feel that college education is damaging to the USA.

In the 1990s, the IQ split across the parties was consistent, with the Democrats in the middle, and the Republicans on the outside.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xik0chzaf9p71.png?width=466&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acc729df0689911e801b5117d345e2ebcf191bcf

Since then, the downwards trend in the USA overall accelerated a bit when George Bush One called college professors 'elitists.' It accelerated downwards a bit more during the Trump Tweets, and dropped a bit more during COVID school closures.

In the last year, it's reached the level where people think stealing sneakers from athletics shops during political demonstrations is defendable as social justice, and the way to change election results is to break into the Capitol building wearing Viking outfits and ninja costumes. The drop in intelligence is at all levels in both parties. At the top of the power pyramid, only seven of 50 GOP senators thought that Trump did not break his Presidential oath to protect the nation by doing nothing to stop an assault on the Capitol building, instead watching it happily on TV as if he had nothing to do with it, until after all of Congress thankfully escaped without harm. Meanwhile, the Democratic minority leader ripped up the President's 'State of the Union' speech directly after he finished giving it, on TV, behind his shoulder, putting Biden in a difficult spot when asking for bipartisan support.

**The Republican Intelligence**

Since the second attempted impeachment of Trump, we witness such events as the GOP saying the President's wife should not be called 'Doctor' because she only holds a PhD, not an MD. The right's assault on respect for intelligence continues, and meanwhile, ironically, the GOP is still more intelligent than the Democratic Party by virtue of a weird 'bathtub curve' in its members' IQ, whereas the Democratic Party's bell curve on IQ is weighted lower.

The oddest anomaly is that those at the low rise of the GOP's bathtub curve of intelligence repeat exactly what those at the other end of bathtub curve say, making them virtually indistinguishable to all outwards appearance, leaving the upper end of the right in total control of Viking hats, ninja costumes...and an endless list of inanities I hear on talk radio every time I turn it on. The vast array of hypocrisy, lies, and logical incoherence is nothing but intimidating:

* Arguing against inoculation mandates and wearing masks when the COVID death rate is going up and the completed vaccination rate is only 54%. And this is not the only case where the GOP has placed its political and fiscal interests above the well being of the human race.
* Giving China an excuse not to close down its own coal power plants, when the North Pole is expected to completely melt away sometime between 2035 and 2060 (current earliest and latest estimates). Any further effort China makes itself would simply be exploited by another future Trump. End of North Pole.
* Borrowing money to send people covid-relief checks instead of arranging for banks to provide loans to people who need it under federal guarantees. That's a populist stunt to raise votes. No other motive. It doesn't even fit with Republican ideals.
* Insisting that untrained civilians should be able to carry pistols in supermarkets for self defense.
* Letting American manufacturers relocate to Mexico without sanctions against lower wages there, then complaining about border immigration problems.
* Saying a new Supreme Court Justice must be slowly assessed when it might be in power after an election, then rushing an appointee through when it's about to lose power.
* Accusing Biden of screwing up the withdrawal from Afghanistan that Trump was too cowardly to do himself.
* Reneging on the Iran nuclear treaty because returning Iran's frozen assets in the USA was stealing from our country.
* Not to be forgotten, asking Arizona to recount its ballots for a new President six times, and still claiming the count was wrong.
* Most recently, approving a raise in the National Debt Ceiling when the GOP is in power, and refusing one to the Democrats now the GOP is no longer in power.
* And finally, gerrymandering voting districts in 2010 so well, it's totally impossible for representation ever to approach a popular vote distribution again.

...etc, etc,...etc, etc...and the masterminds of the inanity hide in a forest of insanity they created. Despite all these problems, the GOP never admits it might have made a bad decision. It always says it's always right, despite that being totally impossible by any odds, and however much it flies in the face of actual facts. We have actual proof of how much the GOP actually values truth. 7 out of 50 senators. That equates to about one in seven members of the party, even when under dire threat of being killed.

**The Democratic Intelligence**

The partisan divide has got so deep, the intelligent members of the Democratic Party have to intentionally make themselves sound stupid to stop a civil war. Trump has business dealings all over the planet, but due to intractable political problems with impeaching him on his actual crimes of nepotism, graft, and perfidy, the Democrats had to resort to ridiculous causes for impeachment. Had the Democrats simply impeached Trump for breaking his Presidential oath, he would have been impeached the first time, avoiding the second. To avoid reciprocal action against its own crimes, the Democrats had to find the most remote accusations imaginable. Just since the beginning of the year, Democrats have handed out four trillion dollars of pork bellies to its supporters. Less than 0.01% of the money it designated to help people with rent during COVID actually reached renters. Since Republicans are a main benefactor from that, they say nothing about it. The two parties are both so corrupted, all they can do is accuse each other and pretend to be angelic.

**Conclusion**

It's not surprising there is such hatred between the two parties. We've become too stupid to do anything else. The only existing force to reverse the partisan hatred has become international war. However, Americans annually pay an average $2,181 per capita for national security, not including vet benefits. That compares to $384 per capita for school, after which you have to borrow money from the government to pay for college. So how does that figure out, exactly?

&gt;**The USA believes it is six times more important to kill people than to think about it first.**

After spending four times as much on defense than any other nation, no one is yet inclined to attack the USA either. There being no contrary force to reverse the political divide, the parties continue to spat with each other about whatever is the stupidity of the day, whether it's climate change or something else. meanwhile, it's become rather inevitable that the North Pole will completely melt away sometime between 2035 and 2060. That will destroy the homeostatic mechanism moderating the seasons and causing worldwide catastrophic climate change the likes of which civilization has never known.

There is a small period of reprieve left, during which social media can continue on its merry course of angelic accusations while the doomsday clock on the future of our environment gets no more than a few insignificant party favors.

With the continuing drop in overall IQ, we are reaching a low threshold where the bulk of the bell curve of intelligence passes below the ability to read much besides streetsigns and six-word memes, and definitely will not be able to write coherently. In the 1960s, reading was thought to require an IQ above 80, so a little maths will reveal that will probably happen this decade or two, after which it won't be possible for people to write any stupider. The proportion of intelligence could even increase in a much smaller group of social-media participants.

The others will probably start fighting over small shiny objects and kill themselves off. So don't panic.

I applied to a number of colleges while in high school and was accepted to nearly all of them. After working through the financial aid offers I narrowed my choice down to a university that I believe would've been more than satisfactory. However, life and COVID got in the way and I needed to change to a local university at the last minute. I'm in the fall semester of my sophomore year and I can honestly say that I have been having an awful time. It's a rule of thumb that any class with the word ""engineering"" in the title is going to be taught by an incompetent teacher. The university poorly handled COVID and instead treated the whole pandemic as a way to make more money (charging extra for online classes/new fees for dropped classes). This semester alone I needed to deal with being stalked by a random student in one of my classes and basically needed to file a restraining order against them. My grades are still decent/good but this place is sucking the life out of me.

I completed my freshman year of college at the age of 17 and was dealing with financial problems, so I dropped out. I was going to App State at the time and there were zero jobs around. Boone is a very very small mountain town and I didn’t have a car at the time. My mental health was declining, I was no where near closer to figuring out what to major in, my grades were terrible… so I left.

A year and a half later, I apply to transfer to UNC Charlotte for the spring of 2019. They were on the fence because I was put on academic probation, but I explained everything in a letter and they admitted me. My grades improved and I had an easier time, but that semester ended in the mass shooting and my best friend was in it, and there were shootings in my university apartment complex—I didn’t feel safe there but didn’t want to transfer to another school again. Didn’t end up having a choice… my family moved to Florida, leaving me with no local family and no permanent in-state residency. 

I was waiting to get my state residency in florida and then go back to school when COVID hit that March. I’ve been doing seasonal work like ski instruction and whitewater rafting since the summer of 2019 cause I was like, f*ck it, the world must be against me getting a degree. Best journey ever though and I got promoted to leadership and have developed amazing communication skills. I’ve applied to go to FSU, UCF and USF, however, the latter two dont accept letters or essays so I don’t know if I have any hope in explaining my case to them. Im sure it doesn’t look good that I’ve dropped out twice, and they all require their transfers have 3 credits of a math course already done, which I unfortunately don’t have.

415,DiningFancy,1632070078,/r/college/comments/prbks5/is_a_minor_worth_pursuing_if_itll_extend_my/,"I'm currently in the 5th year of my 4-year undergrad program. I'm working towards a BBA with a major in Marketing. Covid was kind of rough last year and I ended up going part-time and realized during that time I might be interested in pursuing a Master's in Data Science or Business Analytics. The requirements for these programs included a bunch of math courses I hadn't taken in the past, so I considered completing them all (which would extend my graduation by a year). To get a math minor at my school, there are 7 math courses we need to take; I'd be taking 5 of them for the requirements for the master's program so I decided to just go for the full minor, as that would probably look better on my degree. So, I went part-time last year and got the requirements for 3/7 of the math courses. I'm full-time now and planning to complete 2 during the fall semester, and the final 2 during the winter.

Over Summer 2021, I also ended up getting a position as an intern at an insurance company. I met some amazing people who informed me about a 3-year rotational program the company has for new grads. They recruit for the program a year in advance; I got word of the recruitment and submitted an application. Found out there were roughly 700 people who applied and I was 1 of 40 who got an interview. Fast forward to the end of the summer and I'm 1 of 15 people who were offered a contract, so now I'll be starting with them in September 2022 for the first of my 3 rotations in the program. I was informed that the eligibility requirements for the program include new grads who graduate between December 2021 - August 2022.

My issue is kinda this: I have 4 courses left to complete for my BBA and 4 courses for my math minor. It's possible for me to do the 4 BBA courses this semester and graduate in December, or I could stick it out and do the math courses as well and graduate in April with a minor. My decision to do the minor was also influenced by the possibility of doing an international exchange (I'm from Canada and I would be able to go to the UK for 6 months). My school is set to make an official decision on whether the exchange can go forward in the coming weeks, as Covid caused them to cancel exchange for the last 1.5 years. They are set to make the decision after the official drop deadline for courses at my school. I'm currently enrolled in 6 courses because I wanted to wait until after their decision to drop the 2 courses that would be ""unnecessary"", and dropping after the deadline means I will only get back 50% of the tuition for those courses.

I spoke with a friend and he suggested I should just drop the math minor altogether before the drop deadline and wait to see what happens with exchange. If exchange is cancelled, I'll have already dropped the math minor and be able to graduate in December 2021. If exchange is allowed to go forward, I'll have the luxury of taking 4 elective courses and focus more on travelling and having fun during the last semester of my undergrad.

I'm conflicted now because I have a 3-year job secured for after graduation and I feel like the experience I gain from that is far more valuable in the long run than adding a minor to my degree. After the 3 years of the program, future employers will likely care more about my work experience than my education (especially because I plan to go into the corporate world). The minor seemed like a good idea when I wanted to do a master's, but now that I have a job lined up and don't need/want to pursue the master's anymore, it feels like I can get away without doing the math minor.

I'm really agonizing over this decision. I have a differential equations lab in 2 days that I haven't even started studying for because I'm of the mindset that I'll be dropping the course. If anyone has any advice, I'd greatly appreciate it. Let me know what you think, thanks",college,"Is a minor worth pursuing if it'll extend my graduation date?

Here is the thing I went to this college back in 2019 for a semester but I then dropped out and took a year and a half off. I was not sure if I wanted to go to college so that is why I took the time off but I soon became miserable working these hourly waged jobs. I worked at Home Depot and Starbucks during that time off from school. I realized that this is not what I wanted to be doing so I reapplied to the same school I dropped out of and I am now back at college. 

I commute to school from my house (I live with my parents) and I actually really look forward to learning but I am always sad and lonely on the weekends because I do not go out. The thing is though I know people at this college from my first semester back in 2019 and they invite me to go out with them and hangout in general but I just don't really want to hangout with them or go out with them because I don't feel any connection with them really. They are nice people but I just don't connect with them like I have with friends in my past. They also just never seem that interested in talking. When I do hangout with them I try to talk but they all just sit around together on their phones and don't really listen or say anything. Its just not for me I guess. 

I feel lonely though because I just haven't really been hanging out with them as much and I see them all go out to parties and I feel left out even though I know I could just ask to go out with them and they would say yes. It may also be because I just don't understand everyone's love for drinking in college. Drinking is fun but there are better drugs to do besides drinking. I don't understand a lot of things about college I guess but I really do want to meet people and make real connections with people. I would enjoy drinking more I guess if I had a group of friends I felt a real connection with but I do not. I have been making an effort to meet people which I feel is good. I have joined clubs and I am pretty social and I think agreeable in general so I hope I make new friends and find my group of people.

Thanks to anyone who read this and I hope it was easy to read. I have often been told that when I write it is confusing. I hope this was the right place to post this.

So I’m at a crossroads right now...

I graduated high school with a 3.9 GPA and a 1250 SAT and thought that was pretty good. The colleges I applied to though otherwise and after COVID and a long debate I ended up going to a state school online. First semester I had. 3.2 GPA (in computer science) and was relieved I didn’t flop hard my first semester. When second semester came around I was doing fine until I became extremely ill with a gastrointestinal infection. Due to lack of good insurance, I couldn’t receive treatment until seven months later. During this time I was practically bedridden and had to drop most of my classes. I finished the semester with like a 2.5 GPA. I just started commuting to school for the first time and absolutely despise everything about the school. I learn nothing in class, traffic makes the round trip about 3 hours, people are hostile, etc. the place blows. On top of this, I’ve been struggling with depression, anxiety, side effects of Ciprofloxacin (the antibiotic I used to treat my infection), and my best friend just died.

So I dropped all my classes and received a full refund. I have no clue what I should do next. I worked my ass off in high school and trudged through with severe ADHD and dyslexia. I can’t afford out of state schools but my college GPA isn’t enough to get me into any other state school. I’m miserable right now. I can’t think straight, I can’t even formulate proper grammar at this point. I have the worst brain fog.

I'll be 23 this Thursday, and I've been in college for nearly 6 years, since right before my 18th birthday. I've had a rocky road since I started college. When I graduated high school, in 2016, I had no clue what I wanted to do - and no motivation for school, I wanted to take a gap year. My parents, of course, still threw me into community college, where I failed multiple classes because of A. my learning disability or b. because I'm neurodivergent, and also have social anxiety and am depressed. I hated it so much. And then I found something I liked two years into my college experience. This was in 2018. In 2019, I transferred to a larger university - and don't get me wrong, I enjoy learning, and I enjoy the subject I study but *university* is too much. In my department (I'm an Art History major for context) I have been dubbed this protégé for my writing talents, and I feel as though my department and its faculties have exploited me by putting this pressure on me to do all these things, when in reality... I hate school. 

So. I'm at like 120 credit hours and I need 128 to graduate. I'm taking 7 right now, and I'll need one class in the Spring, and then I'm done. The difficult part for me at the moment, is that I'm also dealing with a lot of personal stuff. Right before the semester, I had to quickly leave my parent's home, because they're transphobic and I had just started T. I'm living with a friend, and that's going well, but I'm struggling to focus on school when I'm dealing with the fact that my parents are transphobic, and also trying to make enough money to live by myself (my parents have also restricted me financially, have emotionally abused me etc.). 

Over the past few months, after feeling like my department put pressure on me to be something I don't want to be, I have realized that I want to pursue something that won't make me feel so restricted to a neurotypical world. I have a passion for making and earrings, and I would like to do that - and also freelance write, as well as maybe have a third little job. I dropped my minor last week, because it's too much - but even only taking two classes is suffocating. I also have two scholarships I was awarded for this semester and the next so it stresses me out.

I dropped out first semester of college in 2018 because I was making a good living from my marketing business. That business is still doing extremely well however I'm now 21 and want to further my education and get into venture capital. I'll likely be attending UCLA next fall.

Due to my business and buying/selling luxury watches, I will be busy awhile in school. Yes, I'm going to college to learn but mostly to meet people and network. However, since my Dad and his entire family are raging alcoholics, I don't drink.

A friend of mine who goes to USC told me that I will be hard pressed to meet as many people as possible and build real relationships with people if I'm not out partying and drinking. And even if I ""party"" but don't drink, nobody will talk to me because when you say ""I don't drink"" you look like a P\*\*\*\*.

I'm kind of lost. I know what my dreams and aspirations are but I've been dreading the path to get there for the last 2.5 years of college and I think I'm on the verge of dropping out.

I thought I was ahead for once this semester. Turns out not so much and I'm already beginning to slip again. I am pretty great at major related courses but everything outside of that has been the bane of my existence. I give it my all and still can't succeed.

One of my classes, this will be my fifth time taking it, and truthfully I'm not even sure I'll be able to pass it this time. I've come so damn close so many times. Even come within half a percentage point about a year ago but it's been a real struggle for me.

Now I'm concerned about future classes and my course load. Even transferred to a much more rigorous university but I'm having doubts about myself and whether or not this is the best path for me.

I still live with my mom and I'm 21. Nearly 22. I feel like if I dropped out this far in my mom would be very disappointed and that worries me. I have a few job ideas in mind but I've got to make my mind up fast.

I have until end of day tomorrow to decide. Just had all of my student debt forgiven so I'm half tempted to just go ahead and give my life a reboot.

I've just worked so hard. This only came to mind because I've pretty much been sitting in a chair working all day on this stuff all week long. I hardly move. I hardly do anything but school and most of its stuff I don't care about that don't relate to my interests.

Thoughts? Am I thinking too introspective right now? Am I crazy to even think about dropping out? Especially having just gotten into a prestigious school (I've been paying for my education by myself FYI).

&amp;#x200B;

To keep things short, my current school right now costs around 4k per quarter. I can pay the 4k and will graduate within 4 quarters, meaning that tuition will be around 16k. The school is an online-only school, and I feel that my education is suffering due to it. I am 22, and I pretty much miss the social interactions with both my peers and teachers. The degree that I am getting is a Data Analyst degree, and I am indifferent to it. I thought that I would enjoy it more than I thought. Overall, cheap school, but boring education and no social life. 

I recently got accepted into a private school, and the field of study in finance, which interests me more. The problem with this school is that it cost 6k to attend, and I pretty much only have the 16k saved up (this is after aid+7k loans for the year). The school is great, and the teachers are pretty cool as well. However, in order to afford attendance, I would have to work, and I would also be losing money from my previous school (around 10k) with 7k debt. My fear is that I am not sure of when I would graduate from this school, it could be 2 years or more. I also thought that I would get more aid, but my mother’s income has recently dropped, so my parents cannot help me out here. 

Current school: 16k out of pocket + 8k debt 

New School: 18k per year + 7k debt yearly 

The only benefit to the new school is that it is a superior education, meaning that everything is better and I think I am more likely to get a job with the new school. 

Please, if you guys want to share your opinions, do it. 

I keep going back and forth, and I am indecisive atm. 

One other thing, I also am appealing the aid given to me by the new school, and am waiting to hear back next week.",college,Should I transfer schools?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/pldqiy/should_i_transfer_schools/,1631265016.0

Got my associates in HS, last year was online, and I'm graduating this year. Next year I turn 20 and get my masters.

Ever since I was 8, when my sister went to college I've desperately wanted that life. Friends, roommates, dorms, events, parties. All my friends did this as well as my gf.

I signed onto a college team for XC/Track. Ran at state in 3200m/2-mile. Covid happened, season cancelled + college dropped XC + Track. Since I had 70+ community college credits in HS I wasn't considered a freshmen but transfer. I didnt go to original college, decided to go to cheapest one since I was paying.

I didnt know what I wanted to major in. Sister's husband told me accounting was good, so I declared that as my major. First year was online so I worked on days I didnt have class.

I knew nothing about getting a dorm. Dad said he'd help. Kept saying he'd help but time kept passing. 2021-2022 year coming to a start, got in fight with parent, found myself homeless and so I had no place to go, and my dad never helped me apply for dorm. Dorms are filled, and since I'm a senior standing, they told me to get an apartment(1100 per month).

School is 1 hr away so I lived on a classmate's porch for first 2 weeks until my sister 45 mins away let me sleep in her spare bedroom. I now commute by bus.
I work a campus job as the treasurer of campus events, so I feel more staff than student.


I can't stand the students. I feel resentful towards them. They're all living the life I want. I'm graduating and I feel like my life ended at 18. It causes issues with my gf now since she lived all 4 years on campus. I feel like sometimes I can't speak to her about it. The kids in the dorms I feel like I can't speak to. I starve myself feeling so upset over losing this college experience, and I can't go back since I'm graduating. I threw my life away by a choice I made at 15.


I can't even run in the NCAA anymore due to my chronic illness that came out of nowhere last year. I flucuate between 120-145 lbs, can't eat most days. I'm just wasting away. My sister helped me get medicaid this month and I'm just now seeing a doctor about it. Getting an endoscopy next friday.

441,SleepySheepHerder,1629996188,/r/college/comments/pc3bni/help_out_a_college_drop_out_get_his_self_together/,"Hello friends 

So I need some guidance.  I am a 30, a veteran of the US military.  I have completed a 2 year associates in applied science in electronic engineering tech degree at a community College in North Carolina.  I went to a University in North Carolina and went into a Engineering Technology degree.  I completed 2 semesters worth of classes before I dropped out.  The classes got to hard, the math always gave me trouble, I never figured out how to basically put everything into the calculator for me.  Then life happens, got married, kid, work, business moved out of NC to Virginia Beach area. 

I want to finish my bachelor's degree in something.  Engineering type degree would be too hard I think at this point in time.  Idk if I could really give it the hours of study I need to be able to complete a degree.  I currently work for the power company on power lines and other high voltage equipment.  I personally do not know any degrees that deal with this industry other than electrical engineering.  So a tech degree, communications, English and whatever as long as I can complete my bachelor's.  

I am currently not affiliated with any college. So I have no academic counselor I can talk to and the ones I had in the past basically tried to shove me wherever they could so I would stop emailing them.  I have looked at Old Dominion University, American Military University, Liberty University, Purdue Global.  I would prefer all online I have no real interest on being on campus unless I have to. 

I know some of these 'only online' colleges accreditation is pretty lacking.  I guess some employers care if it's accredited I have heard others just want you to have a bachelor's and accreditation seems to be an after thought.  So I really don't know if it matters that much at my level that the accreditation is very high or not. 

I have 2-3 semester left on 9/11 G.I. Bill to pay for school.  After that I will use whatever means to pay for school.  If whoever is reading this happens to know of a good way to get someone else to pay for my college like veteran or adult learner grant/scholarship/programs work part time for Walmart since they pay for some degrees now plz share a link or that info. 

So if you have colleges that are more suitable for veterans or know of certain programs that a designed for adults/veterans that I can transfer my credits into so I can use as many of the credits I already have to use, plz share.  I would hope to finish the degree in 1-2 years if possible but if it takes longer I'm willing to commit. 

Thank you for reading this far, I know it is a long post. I appreciate any advice or encouragement. 

TL;DR 
If you had a similar experience with your degree path or can suggest a path to finishing my degree, college, field of study.  Basically any guidance to a 30 year old veteran that needs some direction because all the information I look into takes me into rabbit holes that provide lots of info but do not tell me that the program is a good fit for me.  plz share any info/guidance.",college,Help out a college drop out get his self together.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/pc3bni/help_out_a_college_drop_out_get_his_self_together/,1630014188.0
442,NameWasTakennn,1629947776,/r/college/comments/pbr2rm/lost_financial_aid_due_to_withdrawing_but_have_a/,I lost my financial aid due to dropping out twice during my second year. My first year started 2019 and I was an engineering major at the time. I had financial aid and scholarships for the first year and had to pay very little tuition. Now my second year starts and everything is online due to covid and this is where everything goes downhill. At the time I had bad internet and I was starting to really struggle with anxiety and stress. The internet was interrupting my lectures and so this made me just want to drop out because it was hard to focus and it was making me anxious. I decided to drop out and wait until we go back to in person. I decided to go back in the spring (I was planning on taking a year but parents forced me to go back next semester) and dropped out again for the same reason. I had enough scholarships and aid to cover my whole second year. The school didn’t charge me for that year even though I withdrew twice but what they did do was entirely remove my financial aid and academic scholarships that were given to me by the school for this year. I switched majors to Cyber security due to no longer interested in engineering and currently sit with a 3.65 overall GPA with 30 credits. They removed my aid due to withdrawing so now I’m not sure what to do. I submitted an appeal but was denied. I have good grades and plan on keeping them good but have no financial aid. I already payed the whole tuition bill for this semester and realized that I’m going to have to pay the whole tuition for the next 5 semesters which is a lot of money and that’s something I don’t have. I’m currently really stressed out about this and am not sure what to do or how to get some aid back. Should I switch schools after I finish this year? Is their still ways to get aid? Advice would be appreciated. I don’t wanna be 50k in debt after having almost a full ride initially.

I graduated high school in 2012 and for the past 9 years have been working on my Associates of Science on and off. I have very little classes left until I complete my Associates of Science. Only 4. I was going to do College Algebra and Biology this semester, and then a science elective and chemistry for next semester.

Unfortunately, because it's been so long since I have done any math, I have been completely demolished in College Algebra to the extent where people are saying I should go back and take the remedial math course so I learn the foundations of algebra before I actually attempt it.

So, I dropped out.

So in the future my schedule looks like:

* Fall 2021: Biology
* Spring 2022: Remedial Math and Science Elective
* Fall 2022: College Algebra and Chemistry (Begin applying to universities)

I'm nearly my 30s so I'm just getting really impatient with how I am only taking 1 or 2 classes per semester. I am waiting til I get my Associates because I have done really poorly in high school, and when I was young and dumb got F's (didn't withdraw) in many classes in college, so I feel like I need to actually have my Associates in the bag before I apply for any university.

I plan to major in environmental microbiology... I have a degree and license in phlebotomy, and wouldn't be bothered by the slow pace of these 3 upcoming semesters if I could get hired since, while environmental, it's a step into a field that deals with microbiology; but it's been a bit brutal out there. And now will be even more brutal if I say I am a student and can't come on Mondays and Wednesdays.

I'm sitting at home bored and really hate having basically nothing to do. I am going to start applying for minimum wage jobs (and of course phlebotomist positions) soon but even then... yeah, I am having a tough time with it going so slow.

Or, is this slow to a point where I should just apply for university in Fall 2022? What keeps me from doing it now is that I doubt universities are going to have remedial math courses; so I really have to have my math skills re-aquired before I apply anywhere.

Currently feeling very isolated and don’t immediately click with any of my roommates. I’m very open and friendly but struggle with actually taking the initiative to make new friendships or put myself out there. On top of that I feel I don’t vibe with a large amount of the student body here where there’s a huge emphasis on Greek life and sports.

On top of that I was late registering for classes due to a litany of holds on my account, which means I’m currently only enrolled in 2 classes- one of which is irrelevant to my major, and waitlisted in 6. More of my classes ended up being online than I thought would be the case. 

I’ve never been the best student in college, possibly due to untreated ADHD which means I’m stuck at CU and can’t transfer. I’m a Philosophy major and most career paths would involve Grad school which I’m unsure of my ability to get into with not enough time to turn things around.

I’m going into my fourth year of college but will be graduating in five due to a very rough first year followed by a pandemic. My current degree plan has me taking 5 classes a semester to graduate in the spring of 2023. So far, the most classes I’ve taken is 4, so I’ve been nervous about increasing my work load, especially since I’ve already been struggling and I work part time. But I’m in a better place mentally and thought I could handle it. I’m requesting accommodations for a disability I have and was hoping to use this as a chance to improve my terrible GPA. 


Now for my current dilemma. About 2 weeks ago, my grandfather was admitted into the ICU and it’s been touch and go since then. He’s been intubated 3 times. A few days after he was admitted, me, my grandmother, and about 10 other members of my family tested positive for COVID. I’m just now “getting over it” but my grandmother is still really sick (she’s now covid negative but still has bad symptoms). I’ve lived with my grandparents for years (when not away at school) and am very close to them. But I’m supposed to go back to school next week, with my grandmother still sick, my grandpa in the ICU (as well as another family member FYI), and half my family still sick with COVID. Not to mention, I still can’t go out to the mailbox without feeling faint. 


So basically, I just don’t know HOW I’m going to do this. Leave my family with everything going on to jump straight into five classes that I may not be able to physically get to without collapsing in the middle of campus. If I leave, my grandma is alone. I’ve already dropped a class that I really can’t afford to drop, meaning I’ll have to take 3 summer classes. 3 of my classes are in person with no online option, and though I personally think we’ll end up going hybrid again this semester, I can’t count on that. I’m worried about physically getting to my classes, taking on such a demanding workload immediately following everything that’s happened in my family, and being away when my grandparents are still so sick. If I could take a semester off, or even just take one class to still be enrolled, I would. But that would set me back even further and I’m already graduating a year late. 


On top of this, talking with my advisor is not an option. We have 600 students in my major and only one advisor and getting a meeting is impossible. Maybe later in the semester, but by then the drop deadline will have passed and again, I don’t know what to do in the meantime.

But my college experience wasn’t really a “normal” one. I started off at a big state school that is highly regarded in my state. At the time, I was struggling big time with an untreated anxiety disorder. I grew up in a very small town and went to school with the same 40 people in my grade from preschool-senior year, so I wasn’t used to suddenly being around 30,000 people. I felt very lost and lonely. I didn’t go through sorority recruitment because I felt like I wouldn’t fit in or wouldn’t like it. I ended up getting depressed and dropping out of that school. 

I did the next year and a half at a local community college. It was fine, I enjoyed the classes. But it definitely wasn’t a traditional “college experience.” 

I ended up transferring to a small public liberal arts college to finish my degree. I actually really like this college. It was easy to make friends and it felt like home. I joined a sorority there since the sorority environment at this school is much more welcoming and since at this point I had treated my anxiety disorder and was more confident. 

Then COVID hit and we all know what happened there with being sent home and such. Thinking back on my college experience, I really only got a semester and a half of a “normal” college experience. Meeting new people, joining organizations, going to in-person classes and events, occasionally going to bars or parties. 

My boyfriend currently goes to that big state school that I dropped out of after one semester. When I go to visit him, I’ve been having very mixed feelings lately. Part of me is glad I transferred out and eventually found a college environment I liked better. The other part of me is envious that so many of my peers, people I knew from high school, etc, went there and stayed there from the start and at least got around 3 years of a true college experience. There’s so much more to do in this college town than the one I graduated from. 

I know it’s a grass is always greener type of situation, and I did think I was okay and at peace with my college decisions. But now that I’m graduated, it’s just all hitting. 

I’m about to start graduate school at the same small university I got my Bachelor’s from. Now that I’ve been doing online learning for over a year, I’m used to it and I actually like it fine. It gave me more flexibility to work a part time job and see my friends and boyfriend. I’m not looking forward to returning to in person classes. There is a part of me that loves learning and wants to get a Master’s to further my education and employment opportunities. There’s another part of me that feels like I just want to drop out or go into an online program so I can feel more like a “real adult,” travel or more if need be, and settle down.

So, I was at my female 3rd cousins college graduation party.  Because it was a college graduation party, it lasted until 5:15 am Sunday morning.  There were also like other 3rd cousins there too.  One of my male 3rd cousins, who is probably important to this story, who is also 3rd cousins with the female 3rd cousins, was there.  So, the almost first kiss happened with one of my female 3rd cousins friends.

This is everything significant that happened between me and her.  Btw, she’s either 21 or 22 (2 or 3 years older then me).

First, my male 3rd cousin, the chick, and I were hanging together early in the evening, like 8:30-ish and he was complaining about how I was on my 8th water bottle and that I wasn’t drinking.  (Side note, I was the only sober person there the whole night.  Everyone else (“kids” (college grads in their very early 20s) and adults) were drunk).  Before I even took a sip of my water, the chick starts taking a video of herself and tells me to give her water, so I start feeding it to her.  And my guy cousin starts complaining that she is now drinking water.

30mins-45mins later it was just her and I.  We were talking and I mentioned that I was going to Boston the next day.  She told me to text her when I was leaving for Boston and she gave me her number.  (I forgot to text her when I left for Boston the next day).  We continue talking and she was saying how much she liked Boston.  After a couple more minutes I asked her if she could text me the video of me giving her water, and she texted it to me.

Like another half hour later, her, my male 3rd cousin, three men in their 50s, and I were hanging out and she showed all of us her boobs 3 times.  Her nipples are pierced.

Later, a bunch of us college kids were in the basement and she told me and some of the guys that I was hanging with that she took some guys virginity their senior year of high school.  And she was proud of it.

A long time later, still in the basement, my male 3rd cousin and I were talking for a while.  He eventually asked how I was doing at college with the ladies.  I told him that I’m a virgin and have never had a girlfriend.  He then starts to give me advice and stuff.  I ask him how he does it and he calls over the girl and tells her that I’m a virgin, I have never had a girlfriend in my life, and that I asked him how he does it.  Btw, I was sitting on a barstool chair with my legs spread.  She says nothing and walks over to me and walks between my legs.  She hugs me and leans against my thing and stays like for 10 seconds.  She then breaks the hug, smiles at the both of us, and walks aways.  My male 3rd cousin was shocked, had his chin dropped, said, “that didn’t go as I thought it would.”  Then chuckled and we continued our conversation.  Also, if I mentioned that I haven’t had my first kiss yet when she was hugging me, she DEFINITELY would have kissed me, but I didn’t think of that until after she left.

A while later, she walked by me and ran both of her hands down my body.  She started at my collarbone and stopped at my waist, then walked away.  Btw, I’m extremely ticklish and people don’t really tickle me, so I forget how ticklish I am.  I kind of get reminded how ticklish I am once a year when I’m at my physical and my pediatrician feels around.  So, when she ran both of her hands down my body, it tickled ALOT, and I couldn’t stop laughing, but it did feel good.

Later during the night, it’s like 1:30 am now, her and I and some other people were up stairs and we went outside because she wanted to do a keg stand with me, but we ended up not doing one.

When I was leaving at 2:40 am (I only left because I was waking up for Boston at 6:00 am) she asked if I was leaving and I told her, “yes”.  So, she walked over to me and hugged me.  At the end of the hug, she back up a little bit, but was still hugging me, didn’t let go, looked up into my eyes and told me to text her when I got home.  She wouldn’t let go until I said I would text her when I got home.  Then she let go and said a final bye.  When I got home, I texted her, “I just got home”.  She then immediately texted me back saying, “okay good glad you’re safe🤍🤍”.  I also said Thanks! after that.

My name is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. I am majoring in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and I am going into my second year at the university. I’m writing to appeal my financial aid suspension. I am well aware that my academic performance during my first year was very substandard. I have identified the major problems and actions I had that caused my grades to falter, and I have and will continue to work towards dispelling them. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I’m sure everybody is aware, the coronavirus pandemic greatly disrupted the 2020-21 school year. As someone who's at a higher risk for covid, I decided to stay at home and take classes online instead of actually going on campus. I have never done online schooling before, so the adjustment was particularly difficult. Over the course of the first semester, I found it difficult to keep up with my classes. I have autism spectrum disorder, and I feel I learn much better when I’m actually physically going to classes. In person learning also makes it much easier to have a routine, which is very important to me. Without actually being on campus, it was hard for me to get into a routine or actually be invested in my classes. Meanwhile, the stress and isolation of the pandemic was getting to me. This all culminated in December of 2020, when I had a panic attack. Around the same time, I saw that my grades at the end of the first semester were absolutely unsalvageable, so I withdrew from all of my classes.

&amp;#x200B;

During the second semester, my grades were a little bit better, but some of the same problems still remained. I still found it hard to stay invested in my online classes and keep up with assigned work. I also had periodic spikes in anxiety throughout. Nearing the end of the semester I once again saw that my grades in three of my classes were unsalvageable, so I withdrew from them. I ended up completing one of the remaining two classes, and failing the other, which was \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

&amp;#x200B;

I am extremely disappointed in myself for the way my freshman year turned out. I pride myself on my grades, and was looking forward to going to college before the pandemic put a wrench in everything. Since the end of my first year, I have majorly worked toward eliminating the habits and causes of my unsatisfactory performance. I pursued help for my anxiety problems, and was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and put on medicine. Since then, I have gotten much better at managing my anxiety. My stress levels are much lower, and I am actually excited to go back to school instead of being stressed. I am also currently in the process of registering with student disability services and will take full advantage of the resources they can give me. My covid-related anxiety has pretty much subsided with me being vaccinated and the worst of the pandemic behind us. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I am attending school in person this year, I believe I will find it much easier to stay engaged with my school work. I will obviously attend every class and will seek out help if I struggle with any of the coursework. I am also retaking Media Uses and Effects, and plan to use the second-grade only option. In the interest of improving my focus and getting back on track in terms of pace, I have decided to stop double majoring. I dropped my major in Political Science, and am now majoring in only \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in order to reduce my workload, allowing me to focus more on just one major while completing the required classes and gen eds within the next three years.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm 27 and just recently graduated with my BA in Env Science (with a GIS minor). During the time of me pursuing this degree I have worked solely in Marketing and have not had the opportunity to pursue internships or any volunteer work. To top that off, I have also moved to a state (Michigan) with little to no work for the field I'm interested in .

&amp;#x200B;

I ideally want to be involved in marine conservation, and have had opportunities to work in the NH area in months past, but due to the move I can obviously not entertain any offers. So I'm currently stuck, and wondering if pursuing my graduate studies is my next move; but I'm also unsure if I can pursue graduate studies due to my relatively poor academic performance and lack of overall experience.

&amp;#x200B;

I have two children, and over the past 7 or so years I have had to drop out quite a few times due to me being the only parent involved in their life. I've dropped out a total of three times, and at the point of dropping out I had missed so much class and homework that I was practically failing everything.. At one point my GPA was actually at 1.8. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past few years though, I have made quite a significant rebound and am now currently sitting at a 3.2. I am now in a more stable position, and have a solid support system, so I know that I can handle further academic studies, but I'm thinking that without the work experience no college would actually take me seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm prepping to take the GRE soon, and I've been told if I score well that It'll benefit my application greatly, but I'm unsure if ""greatly"" is enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone ever had a similar situation, or just in general has some advice for how I should proceed?

Basically the governor says no to mandated masks (and lockdowns) in governement facilities.

Multiple counties are rejecting the rule and mandating masks. Dallas County included, which is where I am from. The community colleges.

Both sides are currently filing lawsuits against over each other.

I am afraid this is just a pre-cursor to local counties shutting down colleges completely.

Or even in the case they don't shut down a teacher can arbitrarily decide to go online.

That seems unfounded, but this occured during my summer semester: our teacher had us take a majority-wins vote to decide if we should skip coming in Fridays and that side of the class won.

I operate very poorly online, and just dropped out when COVID first hit over those reasons. I was quite mad at this class-dicatated election because when I payed for my courses I payed for what was advertised: going to class on Friday. I was not informed that there could be a vote by the students to take away what the school sold, and what I paid for.

I personally have no problem wearing the masks, but I am afraid my county is going to reject the governors orders and close down maybe a few weeks into the semester or at the start of it, or if they don't close down my teachers will either choose to do it themselves.

I'm contemplating just dropping out now. Are my fears unfounded or what? Is this a stupid idea?

464,lexvie,1627522828,/r/college/comments/otnvj5/academic_suspension_appeal_letter/,"Hey, I was writing an appeal letter for my college and am nervous. I was wondering if you could look over it and let me know how it sounds. Any advice is appreciated. Im also wondering if it's too long?

&amp;#x200B;

To the Academic Appeals Committee,

  My name is xxx and I am a computer science major. As of the end of the 2021 spring semester, I have been placed on academic suspension from xxxx. I both understand the decision for dismissal and take full responsibility for the actions that led up to it. I have written this letter in hopes of conveying the gravity with which I regard my academic future and summarize the steps I plan to take to put myself back on a path towards academic success.  

  This past year has been the most difficult I have been through and this ultimately reflected in my poor academic progress with my classes. This is my first year at xxx college and when admitted I was the most excited to finally enter a 4 year college because I was so much closer to achieving my dream; a bachelors in science, I could not be more ecstatic! I am the first in my family to graduate from high school, with an associates in science and with the given chance with my bachelors. I was embarrassed to be struggling which snowballed into my situation I currently am in, because I did not want to admit I needed help. 

  When fall semester came along and classes were remote I was struggling with the course work but did not want to admit nor reach out for help. Oftentimes I would ignore office hours and decide to do poorly on concepts I did not understand instead of seeking out for help to understand the topics. I was sure I was going to swing back from the poor grades but the material got harder and I became overwhelmed. I was embarrassed to ask for help or even speak up, resulting in my 2020 fall semester with poor grades. I dropped a class, failed a class and passed 2 classes. Spring semester came along and I was determined and ready to give it my all, when a couple weeks after the semester started my father passed away in Ecuador from covid, I never met my father in person, we only communicated by phone and the relationship we did have was not good but I always knew I wanted to reconcile and one day go to Ecuador to meet him. When he passed I knew that was no longer an option, I was broken that my father passed and I never got to actually meet him. I was unable to properly process my emotions resulting from it. So I bottled it up and tried my best to pretend that I was fine because how can I be grieving over someone I never met. This unexpected news took a toll on my focus on academics. As the semester went on, I saw my grades start to slip and nonchalance regarding my classes. The excitement I had for my academics, my dreams and ambition were not there anymore. I reached out to my professors but these trends were too late, they did the best they could, it is entirely my fault, and what caused me to settle for poor grades.

  For a while, I felt gulity and dumb in grieving for someone I did not know. It took me a long time to acknowledge my grief. I was grieving for a man I didn’t know, a father-daughter relationship that could’ve been but now could never be. As time passed I slowly took steps to improve myself and in healing. I joined an online community of others in my same situation and realized all grief is valid. I started to heal properly once I accepted my grief towards my fathers passing. Since I’ve started celebrating my fathers life. When I think of him I think of his diligence and the passion he had and how I endured those qualities from him. I am disappointed in myself for failing, for letting my dream slip away from me but I'm ready to fail forward. Before my fathers passing I was struggling, his passing was not the only thing that equationed into where I am today writing this letter. I am here today because I was too intimidated to speak up and ask for help. My failure has helped me recognize where I need to evolve, I just need a chance to make my dream come true. 

  Taking these mistakes in stride, I have a plan that I believe will allow me to be successful in this upcoming semester. 

1. I will make use of tutoring resources offered by xxx college
2. I will communicate often with my instructors and Advising staff to make sure that I understand what is expected of me.
3. I will use time-management tools like an academic planner, calendar/schedule function on my phone, and online scheduling tools to make the most of my time.

   As for my major specific Computer Science courses, I will be allotting 2 hours per week to attend office hours with all of my professors to review the syllabus and formulate specific study plans to build upon, creating a habit I will not break. I also will be meeting with my academic advisor bi-weekly in order to keep track of my progress in the program. I will attend more workshops to achieve success in my academics. I have a plan to attend the Computer Lab 2x weekly, once for a weekly one-on-one appointment with a tutor, and another visit to work on material more independently. 

  Since May I was able to acquire an internship through networking. This internship has shifted my mindset and helped me acquire solid and an earnest work ethic qualities that I believe will make me successful this fall semester and the rest of my life. I have been working on myself to become driven, attentive and to speak up when I need help. These qualities I have endured will help me correct the mistakes I have made in the past. Where I am today has allowed me to realize failure is not the conclusion, but rather a new beginning. When I reflect upon the actions that have brought me before this committee I am filled with shame. While I accept there is no one to fault beyond myself for my current standing, I also refuse to surrender my future and dreams. I urge you to consider my appeal and grant me the opportunity to continue my education at xxx to achieve my dream. Thank you for your time, and I hope to hear from you soon.

    Sincerely,

I started taking math (Calculus I) course at a community college on June 14th, as the credits from this course would transfer over to my university. We were assigned two assignments, and I had completed one and missed one due to my father falling ill (stage 4 lung cancer). On the 24th of June, I received an email that I was kicked out of her course, merely because I missed one assignment. I explained to the professor that my father had fallen ill and that her syllabus even states (the lowest quiz/homework would be dropped), so I was under the impression that I would be fine. She explained that she preferred I communicated that with her and that it's the college's policy to remove me from the course. I explained that it was an honest slip-up and wouldn't happen again. Back and forth emails, she had zero empathy for what I am going through and dismissed me in every possible way. She went on to say, if I had an issue with her, to contact the head of the department for more information.

I felt I was being treated unfairly, so I called up my older brother who is an attorney, and went over everything with him. After further research, we discovered that she was incorrect and that nowhere in the college's policy did she have the right to kick me out of her course for missing one homework. I decided to sign a release form allowing my brother to speak on my behalf moving forward. That took a few days to process and on July 3rd, it was recognized. My brother then reached out to the head of the Mathematics department on the 12th as he wanted to gather as much information as possible before contacting him, and the head of the department refused to answer his questions because he could not confirm that my brother was my brother via email (what a joke). I sent an email from my email address and explained to the head of the department that I would be representing myself with my brother's advisement. After pleading my case and proving that it was not part of the school's policy to kick me out, the head of the department responded to my email, ""Please keep in mind that it is late in the course. If you should be reinstated, you will need a plan to do any past assignments the instructor allows as well as to keep up with the current material in the course to get back on schedule."" About four hours later I was reinstated into the course but was not aware as it was sent to my school email. Over the next couple of days, I sent the head of the department emails asking for a follow-up, and on Friday, the 16th of July he confirmed I was reinstated and to check my school email. 

I was very excited to get back into the class and be able to take this course. The only issue was that I was unable to create a ""plan,"" and it was already made for me and is just not feasible. The professor wrote, ""I am willing to allow you back into the class but you have to follow the due dates below and there will be no exceptions."" Without putting the plan in this post, I am expected to learn all of the Calculus I in 9 days (well actually 7 because I was given late notice that I was reinstated). These include watching all of her lectures, taking notes, sending her the notes I took, taking activities on a daily basis, quizzes, and taking tests (which the tests amount to 95% of our grade).  These are abstract, compounding, and intricate concepts that require time to adequately comprehend and apply, especially under timed test conditions. I have been dedicating at the bare minimum 7 hours per day, yet I can't grasp all this material and I feel overwhelmed. I feel strongly that the accelerated time frame imposed upon me for a course that is already accelerated (it's a summer course) isn’t feasible.

I do not want to jump to conclusions, but it seems like the head of the math department and the professor possibly colluded to make sure I fail. The professor is authoritarian, unreasonable, and lacks empathy to the fullest. It seems to be motivated by malice and authoritarian instinct. My family is worried about me because it has consumed so much of my life and I feel like I am losing my mind here.

It was my sophomore year and I was taking mostly gen Ed classes. I found it hard to give a crap about school with COVID and the general stress that comes with finding your way in college. I decided to leave school and not waste money on something I wasn’t interested or focused on. I’ve worked many places and tried to see if I could start my life without college, which was fun and exiting for a while but turned repetitive and it felt like I was becoming stuck and sad that I wasn’t on the track to some sort of goal.

With all of that on my mind I decided try a few classes online, but they are mostly repeat classes or classes that feel way too simple to keep my interest in them. 

Does anyone have any tips for me?

I would like to start this semester the best I can.

The only reason I'm going to college is because of the stigma against those with a GED. I've always got good grades and decided to get my associates degree at my local community college because I could pay for classes with my part-time job and the financial aid I receive. I'm only going to school part time, so it'll take me about two more years to graduate. 

Am I wasting my time and energy? I'm not particularly gifted in math or science so I'm getting the easiest degree I can, a degree in Graphic Design as well as a certification. It's not something I plan to make into a career, now or ever, but it's something I'm mildly interested in that I know I could possibly make into a career in the future if I chose. But generally art degrees don't really get you into the highest paying jobs unless you're particularly gifted or well connected.

I've never had a dream career or a desire to settle down. My dream has always been to travel the US, either by backpacking or living in a vehicle of some kind. I would probably work seasonal or min-wage jobs to pay for my travels/expenses while moving with the seasons. If I ever planned to settle down, it would be in the countryside somewhere I could homestead. Preferably I would be as self-sufficient as possible.

Still, is it still a good idea to continue with college? I live with my parents right now, and if I started working full-time it would help them out, but I'm still trying to think about my future. I don't really know if I'm wasting my time or not or if a degree is even a good idea.

I'll try and keep it as short as I can while touching upon the main points.

I'm Nico, I'm 20, a Freshman going into Sophomore year, and currently attending a local 2 year community college (Westchester Community College) to help me improve my grades as I prepare to transfer to a four year school. Coming out of High school I didn't have the best habits academically. I often didn't do my work and it resulted in poor grades. Although I was capable, I never had the motivation to follow through. I looked forward to starting college so I could start fresh, but the virus hit and sent us into lockdown, I was forced to take my classes from home inside my room, where my performance only dropped further. It was hard for me to maintain my focus while being stuck at home in my room. I failed several classes throughout the fall and spring semester of 2020-2021. For the classes that I have passed, the grades range between B's and D's.

Currently, I'm writing this mid summer of 2021, I took two classes over the month of June and passed one with a B+ (English), the other unfortunately I failed (Spanish). My goal is to transfer out by 2022 to a 4 year university that offers a Nursing program, as my dream is to become a Nurse of some sort, whether it be an NP or CRNA, I just know that I want to get into a Nursing Program first. My school of interest is Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Connecticut (Acceptance Rate: 70.1% / Average GPA: 3.4). They ask that I complete 2 semesters of English, Science, and Math, alongside two humanity courses and two social sciences that are equivalent to the courses at their school. I've made sure to take classes at my community college that are equal to theirs. I've been successful in passing a few of these, but as mentioned before, I did fail a few, and I aim to retake them this coming fall. As of now, my GPA isn't the best, and my track record isn't that good either. I know I'm capable, and I want to prove that through the coming semesters, I want this to be a time of change. My main concern is that I won't have enough time to prove myself to the school in the given time frame (Fall and spring of 2021-2022), Given that my first year was a complete bust.

I suppose what I'm asking from anyone, is that if they have any advice on the situation, or feel that they would like to share their thoughts, please do so, anything would be greatly appreciated at this given time. I will do my best to respond to those who do.",college,"Help!

Anyways, I’ve been in and out of college for almost 10 years. I’ve dropped out, struggle tremendously and idk if I should give up. Maybe school will never be a thing for me. I’ve dealt with serious anxiety issues and some depression. During my college journey I was in therapy, but it just never worked out for me. Probs wrong fit. 

College Journey:

4 year university: went for a semester straight after high school. 8 hours away from 🏡 and tbh I transferred out bc I had no friends, and constantly worries about family being that far away. I wish I never went

3 years community college: I kept changing my major bc I didn’t know what I really wanted to do. Between those times I dropped out once, which was towards the end 

2 year break: worked lots of different jobs and thought I never wanted to go back to school bc I’m not smart enough 

This year: I did online college and even though it was great, I was under tremendous stress as u had to go full-time (your own pace according to uni). I work 40-45 hrs a week to 2 children as a nanny. I eventually dropped out as I felt like it was all just too much for me :( 


I know what I want to do, but it’s like this constant fear of failure. For example, I failed a test I studied so hard for, it must mean I’m not smart enough for college. It brings on even more anxiety that I literally don’t know what to do. So then I stall or get in the worst depression. I love school growing up, but after graduating hs...it’s like I’ve changed completely. Why can’t I just graduate? 

:(  How do I get this part of my life done with? I love school and It’s been a dream of mind to just graduate. That’s all...I just want to finish something. I want to stop worrying about paychecks, health insurance. I want to be able to support my family if I ever have one. Living pay check to pay check, or working dead end jobs with no advancement isn’t something I want forever.

Some background: I graduated highschool in 2017 and went directly to FSU for the summer semester. While I loved the school I had a few large life events that caused me to underperform and my gpa was anywhere from a 2.0-3.0 per semester. This continued for 2 years until I had something of a mental breakdown over the debt I had accumulated (about 18k) and the state of my performance at university. 

At this point I dropped out of FSU and decided to join the military, which I promptly also quit and I moved back in with my parents. I got a job working retail which kept me afloat until I could get my footing. I very recently got a new (much better) job with has allowed me to move out of my parents place and in with my girlfriend.

I studied in the UCLA film program for 2yrs but dropped out for financial and personal issues. I spent another two years working as a 3D printing teacher in a HS in Korea and I have now realized that I want to pursue a degree in EE or CS. I am currently self-studying programming and math, and I'm enjoying it a lot.

A big issue is that I failed a class right before dropping out, so my GPA dropped from 3.7 to 3.37. Another issue is out-of-state tuition cost. If I go back to UCLA, I plan to move to Cali and work for a year to get in state tuition, but there goes another year of my life. If I transfer, I'm going to have to go to a cheap school or apply for a transfer scholarship, but I don't know if that's possible with that GPA. I really can't afford to take out any more loans.

Here's what I think I can do:

1. Change majors - Go back to UCLA and petition to change majors to engineering. But it's almost impossible to change majors into their engineering school, especially with that GPA, and I did not take ANY math classes.
2. Transfer after fixing grades - go back to UCLA, pay out-of-state for one semester, take some math classes, retake the class I failed, and fix my GPA. Then transfer to another engineering school in the US.
3. Just transfer right now to another engineering college and explain my personal story. Again, I didn't take any math classes and my GPA is poor.
4. Start fresh - apply to another college as a freshman. I am totally okay with doing this, and it also seems like there will be more scholarship opportunity. If I have to retake the SAT, I am good with that as well. Obviously I'll have to omit the fact I went to UCLA.
5. Start fresh at an engineering school in Seoul, Korea. I am here now, and I've heard it's easy for foreigners to get into top schools. This might be best, because college is basically free if you do well.
6. Go to cheap community college, fix some grades, and transfer out.

I honestly don't know what to do in this situation and whether there are more options that I'm missing. I would love for some input and also any advice in general with this situation. Which plan might work best?

TLDR - Went to UCLA for 2yrs as a film major, dropped out for another 2rs, want to go back to school as an engineering major, but have a suboptimal GPA.

 2016 I decided to go to college and i completed my

 able to look up to me and not see me as a failure. I want them to not follow in my footsteps and actually aspire for something greater.

 I don't know what I want to do with my life. I want an
 education, but I don't know in what field. I've thought
 about a computer degree such as IL CS, or CIS as a
 few examples, but I'm not sure I'd be able to cut it there
 either. I pretty well just perform my duties at home and
 my only hobby is playing computer games. I have a

I don’t know where to take this but I feel this is a safe space for me. I graduated in Spring of 2017 with my high school diploma and an AA through the early college program. 

By fall of that same year, I had moved to another city to further my education at a university as a transfer student. I was living on campus as a Junior at the time with my interests leaning toward Psych. Academically, I did well during my first semester and enjoyed my courses for the most part.

The second semester (Spring 2018) had a decent start. Eventually, I became unmotivated to the point where it was difficult to get out of the bed in the mornings. My mind was at a low point and I would question why I was even there. I won’t go in depth about how bad things were, but my mentality wasn’t meshing with the experience in that moment. As a result, I failed my classes not only because my attendance was low, but because I couldn’t bring myself to do any of the work.

That summer, I took out a loan with my bank to pay the school back for my downfall and decided to give it another try. Since I was returning, I was placed on academic probation for my poor performance the previous semester. This was Fall of 2018. The same thing happened. I decided to shut it down altogether before it worsened going into 2019. 

Since quitting, I’ve been making payments on student loans whilst paying my bank for the loan I borrowed in 2018. I’ve also been dealing with guilt because I know I have the ability to be a decent student and I loved the field I was studying, but I failed when given the opportunity. Twice. University isn’t a necessity to succeed in life, but I attempted to go down the route and my performance didn’t align with my capabilities.

I’ve been contemplating how I should go about returning but I don’t know what my starting point should be.

For a career, my preferred path is game design, with some form of software development coming after.

If I happen to be lucky enough to find a game design program that focuses on the coding and development aspect of game design, is it worth it to just minor in that? I don’t know how far having just a minor in something can get me compared to a major.

Additionally, I have questions about being a part time student. When I was younger, I constantly heard things from older folks in my family about making sure to not fail any of my college classes, as I’ll have to pay for those classes again. However, everything from my experience of college application and living and paying for it was tuition based by semester/year, and not for individual classes?

I am in need of advice. I am aware that the title may be perceived as sort of inflammatory and may trigger preconceived notions, so please allow me to explain my dilemma as succinctly as possible at this juncture.

I am currently an undergraduate (junior) student at a STEM-focused school. I transferred there from a 2 year and spent a year (online) at this school pursuing a Biology B.S. I was originally very excited to matriculate at this institution, due to its strong research focus and its reputably strong STEM program. However, my idealism about this college has almost completely vanished after the completion of my Spring semester. I failed my first class (Genetics) in my college career with an F grade, despite reasonable effort and studying. This is for many reasons. I believed the professor to be completely unreasonable, giving shorty-timed, extremely difficult exams with no backtracking allowed. In a final acknowledgement, this professor alluded to the fact that the course difficulty was increased due to concerns of widespread cheating. Out of a class of approximately 170 students, 70 dropped out, and many pre-med students took a ""W"" when they came to the realisation that they would not be able to pass this class. The class average was extremely low, and may failed. Being new to this process, and not signing up for a pre-med advisor, I was not aware that a W option available to me. I have now come to find out that the STEM department at this school is ridiculously difficult (IMO unnecessarily so), the Biology and Engineering departments even moreso, with high fail rates. Biology courses here are known as ""GPA killers"" and many professors seem to take delight in failing students and are generally apathetic. I should state that this is a concern voiced by many students, and many have resorted to changing their majors entirely (Psychology seems to be the most common) and take only medical school prereqs and upper-level electives, often taking ""harder"" science courses like Ochem at other colleges for transferable credit at our college. The Math courses are also extremely difficult and tailored to the Engineering students, irrespective of department, and Math sequences for Bio majors are inflexible (Only Calculus sequences are allowed, not Statistics).  


I am thinking of transferring to another senior college within my school's same university system. I should also note that this school is closer to me (my commute time would be halved), similarly prestigious and it has a good, fairly rigorous Pre-Medical program and according to students, is more supportive. I have not taken any of the medical school prerequisites, only Genetics and 2 Precalc/College Math classes (which I got a C+ and B in). I have otherwise maintained As here, and have some 30-something credits left to finish.  
My dilemma is that I know that medical school is very difficult. I know it's not going to get any easier from here and don't want to ""take the easy way out"", but I also don't want to kill my potential medical career before it has even started, and have to consider the option of pursuing expensive SMPs or Postbaccs I might not have the financial resources to fund, if my undergraduate career will continue to trend in this way. My GPA has already dropped. However, if this school is indeed so unreasonably hard, I don't want to put myself under emotional duress just trying to PASS classes, as a fairly dedicated student. I will miss this school if I transfer though. I loved the campus and the potential access to some great professors and research labs.  


Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Should I transfer? Do Medical schools look down on students who transfer colleges? Should I retake classes I got a C+ in?

 I realized that I somehow missed one assignment that was worth 40 points, and it ended up being the thing that dropped my GPA enough that I couldn't come back from it. I always do every assignment, and always put my best work in. I asked the professor if I could make up the assignment for even half point credit and he denied me.

I was under a lot of pressure, had a lot of personal/emotional problems going on, and I guess i just lost my way. But what i didn’t realize back then is (and my gpa was around a 2.7 at the time so not exactly great), its not about how well you do in college... its about DOING college. Like, just getting it done. Every day since then i wonder who I’d be, how I’d be, where I’d be, who my friends would be if i just stuck with my school/program and stayed. Its as if i thought college was a summer camp, and i was ready to leave.

Anyways, I’m about to turn 22, and I’m watching all my friends from high school/college graduate, knowing that they went through a year of covid college (which sent EVERYBODY home, AND made class easier), and moving forward with their degrees and their lives. Frankly, i had quite a few friends at my school, and knowing that they’re all leaving makes me pretty upset. But the past is the past i suppose.

Anyways, I guess I’ll sum this up with, stay in school kids, ESPECIALLY if you’re in the middle of your fourth semester... jesus. By that point you’re locked in. You can’t just leave your fourth semester!!! Since leaving I’ve just worked odd jobs, mainly in restaurants, and completely lost all passion/interest for things. It sucks.

I'm a first-year student at Harvard, studying remotely from another country since I'm an international student. 

This year has been rough... the learning situation was good during the first semester but I still had some difficulties (Zoom is banned in my country so I had to use different applications to have access to it which lowered my Internet speed, I live in my grandparents' house and don't have a room on my own which made it a bit hard for me to focus well, and many other issues..). I found lots of friends during this year which was definitely amazing! My classmates are all very supportive and kind and I feel so lucky to have them! 
However, this semester (Spring) my GPA dropped from 3.8 to 3.75, and now I feel so bad about my performance. 

I took a chemistry, genetics, literature, and general education course this semester and received the following grades: A, B, A, A-. In the first semester, I took a biology, history, calculus, and writing course. My grades were A, A, A-, A-. 

Even though this semester was shorter, it was all so busy for me, and I struggled a lot with the genetics course. I reached out to my TF for the materials I struggled with and she told me that this course is hard and I don't need to worry, we're in a global pandemic and grades shouldn't matter to me, etc. In the meantime, everything in this course was graded so harshly and when I asked my classmates I figured out all students struggled with this course.

As for my other courses, the staff were extremely supportive and nice. One unexpected thing in this semester was that I had to travel and stay in another country for ~20 days for having my visa interview and I took all of my finals there which was a bit stressful. 

I wish I had done better and had more control over my situation. The reason why I'm worried about my GPA is that I'm thinking of doing a PhD or MD in the future, and this drop in my GPA has stressed me out. 

I was wondering if it's usually possible to get better grades/have an upwards GPA trend in the sophomore year to get my GPA back to 3.8. When it comes to graduate school and MD, is a 3.75 GPA considered a good one? (On Google it seems that most students getting into med schools/PhD programs have an average GPA of +3.8).

Hi, my name is ____, my major is Pre-engineering and I have failed myself, my school, and my dreams. When I received my academic suspension letter in the mail I can’t say I was surprised; I’ve known I wasn’t living up to my responsibilities as a student at this wonderful university. I allowed myself to be distracted and fell into a dark place this school year. I know there are no excuses. I understand that completely and want to ensure the committee has recognized my failures and the actions that led me to be in my current position. 

Starting in the fall I was a transfer from my local community college I was a more consistent student due to my attendance to all my classes I was able to keep up with my school work but this past year being partly online and in-person while also scheduling all my classes in the afternoon allowing me to be too lax; was a poor choice on my part and if readmitted I would schedule morning classes along with making all my classes in person I know this will help with my grades by still allowing me time to wake up and go but also get breakfast to make sure my mind and body are conducive to a learning environment. To further help me I will buy a physical day planner that I will update daily because when I see a notification from my phone it can easily be ignored by me and allow deadlines to escape me repeatedly even when the work has already been completed.

Hi, my name is Olalekan Lawal, my major is Pre-engineering and I have failed myself, my school, and my dreams. When I received my academic suspension letter in the mail I can’t say I was surprised; I’ve known I wasn’t living up to my responsibilities as a student at this wonderful university. I allowed myself to be distracted and fell into a dark place this school year. I know there are no excuses. I understand that completely and want to ensure the committee has recognized my failures and the actions that led me to be in my current position. 

Starting in the fall I was a transfer from my local community college I was a more consistent student due to my attendance to all my classes I was able to keep up with my school work but this past year being partly online and in-person while also scheduling all my classes in the afternoon allowing me to be too lax; was a poor choice on my part and if readmitted I would schedule morning classes along with making all my classes in person I know this will help with my grades by still allowing me time to wake up and go but also get breakfast to make sure my mind and body are conducive to a learning environment. To further help me I will buy a physical day planner that I will update daily because when I see a notification from my phone it can easily be ignored by me and allow deadlines to escape me repeatedly even when the work has already been completed.

508,altoid932,1621449276,/r/college/comments/ngdecu/panic_attack_parents_want_to_see_grades/,"First year college, failed 2 classes. 19 years old, is my computer science career sealed?

Hey everyone, currently writing this after a miserable day. Failed both my finals for my college class and now have a 65% (D) in both.

I am a freshmen community college student, majoring in computer science. This is my second semester. My first semester I got an A in my programming class, A in English and 2 B’s on my other classes which landed me comfortably at a 3.46 gpa. Basically I did for the first time ever, good.

This has been the first time in my life I had actually been able to do something and change my life around. I’m trying to keep this short as possible to not bore anyone since everyone has a sob story, but for the first time I actually felt happy, my parents were proud, life just seemed so perfect to what it was once in my terror years in highschool at home with family life and getting into trouble in school.

However second semester comes, and I screw it up like everything I do. I took 2 programming classes, a math class, and 2 general education classes. I was doing great at first, but the last few months have slowly fallen and spiraled down. Issues with parents, with myself, financial issues, everything. I managed to land 2 Bs for my math and general Ed class, an A for one of them and got my 65% for one of the classes and another D for another.

My gpa will be sitting around a 2.9 What do I do? Am I screwed? I read online that after failing some classes transferring to a state college or university is unlikely and I’m scared beyond comprehension. Everything I ever told and promised myself and my parents down the drain. What’s worse is that if I want to apply for a computer science major for a state college after my 2 years, will my chances be lower because of the specific grades for computer science related classes?? I know I can retake the class and it replaces the old grade in the GPA, but it still appears on your permanent record and am shitting myself that these will be permanent taints that will haunt me in my life

I am genuinely just so terrified. I was starting my life off so good and I thought I could change but it seems as if the battle is in winnable. I am 19 and just really in need of some advice, words of wisdom, reality checks etc. I’ve been learning and want to continue learning on my own and make projects and ideas with programming but without the bachelors it seems as if getting a job anywhere will be impossible. I want to have the bachelors and more but it seems as if I cut my path and ended it by failing the classes I needed to prove to be able to even be considered to try and get a bachelors.

\- UPDATE 5/19

My father just asked if there was anyway he could see my grades, my heart dropped and the world seemed to have ended. I do not know what to do or what to do with my life. It feels as if i am at rock bottom and any escape will be acceptable at this point. my brain feels like its gonna explode from all the possible scenarios and outcomes playing in my head: getting kicked out, never making it in life ever, turning out like my parents said i would if i continue down my path of being me. if my dad sees my two failed classes i am as good as dead. he is a programmer for 15+ years and seeing me fail 2 computer science classes not because of my inability but because of my stupidity and incompetence will certainly seal the deal on how we views me, guiding me and advising me, or even worse kicking me out. my step father and my relationship has always been filled issues since i can remember and i just dont know what to do since the only time they were ever proud of me was when i was doing great this year in college and now i messed everything up. my finanical aid covers my college because of my finanical situtation being bad, so retaking the classes will be paid for and what not but it just rlly scares me on what i do now as far as maybe housing (if they decide to kick me out for the 2 fails).

i promised myself and them i would do perfect, and i was, i would even sometimes brag about how well i was doing because for the first time i felt valuable and like an actual person with meaning, and a one and a half month stump lead me down a spiral of negativity and hatred that i cant escape even till right now.

What do I do? I truly love learning and want to learn more about programming and continue down the road learning more and more, but college this year because of Covid has been weird in its ways and just doesn’t feel like I expected. I guess all I rlly want is to hear some life experiences or advice and criticisms because In a way it makes me be not so hard on myself. I just feel so lost and worthless, people are all over the place taking insane classes getting crazy grades and I’m here struggling every single day driving myself mad at home inside 24/7.  i am terrified how my parents will react, if i will be kicked out, if in their eyes my career or future or i guess potential of me being anything is done and that i have just proven to them i am the same fuck up as i was all my teenage years and now.

1.) From my standpoint, how feasible is it to transfer after one year of CC? If so, would I still need to show my high school stuff, since it would be two years since high school? And in general, what are the difficulties of transferring from CC to an out-of-state school?

2.) Even though I got dropped, and since I am going to CC next semester, are my credits from Purdue still transferable at all?

I found it very difficult to pay attention in class and keep up with the course work, I lost a lot of points through constantly missing deadlines which negatively affected my grades. That’s also around the time I started falling into depression and my anxiety was getting really bad.

Fafsa would pay for me to live in a single, as opposed to continuing to live with roommates in LA w/o school obligations.

Im covered for tuition and housing by fafsa as an independent student. I dropped out of college last fall during covid as a sophmore in economics.

The question comes down to whether to come to college again and take advantage of its benefits (connections, socializing, intellectual enrichment etc.) or if the college life would be too distracting to my musical and financial goals.

Again I don't want to belittle other people or anything, I just I can't feel proud and some people call me inspiring but I guess I feel such a strong sadness and weight from everything, I can't feel proud, in part because it feels like wherever I end up, I do my best, but something happens or multiple things converge, and I just, find myself having to just deal with a new crappy situation. Burnout, possible undiagnosed ADHD contribute to this.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why I typed this, I guess I'm looking for advice on how to feel proud in such a situation where I just feel like I only have what it takes to survive.

For context: the program allows a select group of undergrads to complete a thesis under a faculty advisor within a year. At the beginning, looking articles up for literature review and formulating an idea was enjoyable, but once we started getting into proposal writing, I started *hating* my time in the class. Imposter syndrome didn't help either (hello fellow first-gens), since I was constantly comparing myself to my Honors peers and every time I began writing, I felt extremely inadequate. I started dreading all of our writing assignments since every time I made an attempt to start, my brain would just constantly tell me ""You're trash, you don't belong in this program."" I started handing assignments in last-minute, which later evolved into handing drafts in several days late. The only thing that kept me from dropping mid-semester was the intense fear of failing from giving up so easily. When I reached out to my professor about it, she's told me my performance in the program so far has actually been good, but I deeply believe I'm just not cut out for research. This realization makes me incredibly scared since I had plans of applying to Master's programs after graduating, but this whole experience has left me with a lot of self-doubt. I'm probably going to get dropped from the program, since I need at least a B to continue and will probably be making a C, at most (since I'm handing in my final proposal several days late).

**TLDR; Might be getting dropped from my major's departmental honors program (thanks imposter syndrome), am concerned how this may affect my chances at grad school.**

Has anyone else gone through something similar? Would there still be any hope in me pursuing a non-thesis Master's program with something like this on my transcript so late into undergrad? I definitely want to continue my education beyond undergrad, but this whole experience has left me hopeless for my future.",college,Thoughts on dropping out of a departmental honors program?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/n90nzq/thoughts_on_dropping_out_of_a_departmental_honors/,1620658229.0

I'm 21 and currently in Community College for three years with 10 W's and still counting. On a Scholarship, which I'm pretty sure I might be losing sometime soon if I keep up at this pace :) Anyways, I was wondering if you guys were going through the same problems or if anyone went/still going with a lot of W's to their name. I racked up 6 W's pre-covid because I didn't know what major I wanted to pursue. I thought I wanted to go into business but I found it extremely boring and also jumped off the cliff with my Calculus I class (2 W's). Decided to try music but my social anxiety got the best of me and I couldn't perform in front of people without getting sweaty, stuttering , and trying to avoid performance all together (4 W's).

Now I'm majoring in computer science. I started last year Spring 2020. Everything was going fine until Fall 2021. I didn't feel confident in my classes, occasionally stopped going to classes, assignments started piling up, anxious to confront my professors, then dropping classes all together. (3 W's). You would think a person would do better next semester. This semester, I withdrew from the same class I did last semester. Making it a solid 10 W's. I'm off track and supposedly taking 1 class next semester because the class I dropped was a pre-requisite class in order to take my final 2 classes. 

I'm feeling extremely shitty because I know I'm pretty lazy, procrastinate a lot, and have bad habits. I'm the third/last child in my family, I know it has nothing to do with this but I fall into the stereotype of the third child not being the brightest. I'm extremely hard on myself because I compare myself to my older siblings a lot. Oldest being a social media influencer and the other being an accountant. I go to therapy to work out my social anxiety and motivation issues. In which, I find college to be pretty pointless because I'm cheating my way through school a lot of the time and have no solid goals or career paths I want to follow. 

I think what I'm trying to get out of this post is if other people feel like they shot themselves in the foot while being in college. Like, keep on making the same mistakes but having no drive or passion to want to be in college but have to be there because you have no other choice to. i.e your parents expect you to finish college, you have no plan B, your advisors telling you what paths to take or tell you to try harder but you don't so you end up feeling like a failure.",college,How has your time in College been?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/n5bxgx/how_has_your_time_in_college_been/,1620225130.0
522,125098124,1620069384,/r/college/comments/n44p8n/trying_to_figure_out_what_to_do/,"Hello folks, sorry for the incoming essay.

Right now I'm a junior working towards a B. A. in History with a minor in Music. Yes, I know, useless major. The full story was that I also had a major in Education, I was going to become a history teacher. Then Covid-19 hit and I lost a required student teaching opportunity because ""essential personnel only"" at schools. This student teaching was required to complete the education program, so for now I've dropped it. This does however leave me in a bit of a hole, since now my upcoming degree is gunna be useless with pretty much no real job prospects, and I don't really have the time to switch in a more useful major or minor.

My father's cancer relapsed recently, it's the third time. Externally, he looks in a lot worse condition than the first two times, and I'm legitimately afraid he won't be around much longer. A bit of a problem since between his job and the family savings (which are nearly dried up now), he's basically bankrolling 3/4 of college for me. I work 25+ hours a week after classes in fast food to help pay for a tiny bit, and I've taken some federal loans for the remainder. Partially because I was an absolute idiot who didn't plan ahead sufficiently for this sort of situation, partially because of a recent rapid grade slump, and partially because I spend so much time outside of school working instead of studying, my GPA is just barely above a 3.0 - so while I'm not in danger of getting kicked out, and I could still apply to some lower-tier graduate programs, I probably can't expect any scholarships or grants to help out.

My greatest fear at this point is that I'm going to graduate and not be able to find a half decent job, and get stuck working fast food for the rest of my life (which doing the math I can just barely manage, I'll just have to kiss any dreams of returning to school or ever having a family goodbye). I know that in order to actually have a chance higher than 0.001% of getting a half decent job, I'm going to need to go back to school. But with family savings literally almost emptied out (we have just barely enough for me to complete senior year), and my father literally breaking down, I don't know if we can do it financially. Plus, just looking at my father barely able to drag himself out of bed every day, coughing and barely able to stand, hurts my heart. As soon as I graduate and I'm no longer a burden on him, I legitimately want him to just take whatever money we've got left in the bank, and just go retire and enjoy life. He's earned it, unlike me. He's got a long list of things he's always wanted to do and places to visit, and he hasn't traveled for a vacation in almost 20 years. 

At the same time, the more I keep going to school, the more I hate it. I know I should count my blessings, being able to attend a fairly highly ranked school with enough savings available to pay through without having to take any loans except federal loans, but as I keep going I find it harder and harder to focus nowadays. Just one year ago I would spend all of my spare time just poring over historical texts and reading as much as I could, history was the one subject that I found joy reading and talking about; I legitimately could spend hours just talking about history. But over the last few months that's all changed. I barely motivate myself to get through the readings required for the next class. My grades are just slipping, and the more time I spend trying to study and work on papers and such, the more frustrated I feel when my grades keep going down. I'm kind of just forcing myself through the hoops at this point. I keep thinking about how my history degree is literally going to be useless in the job market, and that I've spent the last three years doing feck all without any actual result. I can't bear to read any of the stuff I used to. Just last week I took my small collection of history-related books and just dumped it all in the recycling bin. Inside, I've begun to feel resentment against my interest of history; or maybe, I just hate myself in general.

When I was in high school, I had a friend who actually still lives down the street from where I do. He was your classic future ""going places"" kid - really good at music (got into Nationals so you know he's good), tons of connections, a near-perfect high school GPA filled with APs and honors, tons of extra academic awards. He was literally the one kid everyone said was going to be a future lawyer - he was going to make it in life, he would just breeze right through and everything was going to be great. He even got accepted to Harvard. Then in the last two months or so of high school he just suddenly stopped showing up to school. He never ended up going back to school again, never attended graduation, I'm not sure if he even got his high school diploma. He spends his entire day either cooped up in his house staring at the walls of his room, or walking around outside alone for hours. From what I've heard, he doesn't really talk to anyone anymore except his parents, turned down his offer from Harvard, doesn't have anything he does in life (he doesn't even have a job), and pretty much nowadays all he does is exist. I'm scared that I'm turning into him as well, except a lot more slowly. I can barely force myself to go to classes I used to be passionate about, I have no interest in the things I used to enjoy, I no longer really have any goals in my life. Above all, recently I myself have started going for ""short walks"". I tell myself that I'm just going to take half an hour to clear my mind, and a moment later it's been four hours and I've just wasted all of my spare time with no memory of what happened. I legitimately think I'm burning out, and I'm afraid of turning into my neighbor - all promise and potential, but he burnt out of high school and nowadays he's just a ghost that just sort of exists.

Now of course this isn't the place to talk about finding a job; I've already made posts about that elsewhere, so there's that. But I am trying to weigh out my options. When I was 17 and just about to jump into college, I wrote out a path that I wanted to take based on my interests, but didn't think too hard about the other possible paths, or about a backup plan. This time, I'm going to spend some time assessing every single one of my options before I go anywhere, and I'm going to make sure I've crafted at least some sort of backup plan.

After some thought, reflection, and research, here's what I've come up with in terms of options.

Problem 1: Graduate early to save money (useful for future financial emergencies, or early funding for a future return to school if that happens)? Now that I've dropped the education dual major, I'm actually on track to finish almost all of my graduation requirements for my History major and general education. My music minor is already complete, and doing the math it's possible for me to finish up the last requirements and graduate next semester, which would be one semester early and save me 30k (which mathematically I've calculated would be enough for me to barely survive for one year where I live).

1. Graduate early, take the money saved, and roll with it. The pros are that I get to save enough money to survive a year, and I only have to worry about burnout for one more semester, instead of two. The cons are of course I'll have one less semester to fill up with classes to attempt to pad my GPA, so my final GPA will probably be lower than it could be, hurting my chances of getting into a half decent graduate program in the future, or returning for another undergrad degree.
2. Don't graduate early, spend the final semester just padding my GPA with random classes. The pros are that obviously I get to mentally put off the future for another semester, graduate alongside my few friends, maybe get some final happy memories before I face reality, and of course, I get one final semester to attempt to pad my GPA with easier classes which might help if I go for graduate school. But on the flip side, I would need to keep potential burnout at bay for one more semester, and I'd end up with less money and a tiny bit more debt. Also if I screw up and keep burning out, I'll end up with a worse GPA.
3. Put off graduation and basically redo college to get an actually useful degree. This is technically an option, but considering the family's financial concerns and my father's health, as well as my feelings of burnout, this would be incredibly risky. The pro is that I obviously get a more useful degree with actual market value. The downside is that with the finances in such dire shape I'd basically have to bankroll the entire education with private loans, which might end up killing me even more afterwards. Plus, I'm already burning out now, and completely collapsing and turning into my neighbor two years down the line with all these private loans out would literally not only end my life, but also everyone else in my family, with no result. Still, if all my other options are sufficiently stupid ideas, I'm willing to give this a shot; it'll just be a huge gamble with the odds against me.

Problem 2: Go for further education immediately? My GPA as-is won't be good enough for medical school or law school. I have absolutely no interest or knowledge in medicine anyway, so forcing myself through that might just burn me out even more anyway. It's still good enough for some programs at schools with lower rankings, although my grade slump in the last year or so is going to impact how admissions looks at my GPA. Plus, immediately jumping back into school is going to kill me financially, not as much as delaying graduation since I might qualify for more federal funding if I do a master's, but still, I probably won't qualify for scholarships or grants and the family savings are nearly dry. On the other hand, at least I get to dodge reality for a few more years, and I might come out with a more useful degree.

1. Get a Master's in Education, which would be the plan that most closely follows my original dream. With a state school it wouldn't cost too much, so theoretically if my father was alright with it we could make it work without taking too much in loans. Downside is, in my state, we have too many qualified history teachers for open positions, so if I can't somehow beat out the most recent 1:900 ratio that's been reported, I'm going to be back where I am already, but with more debt. Plus, potential burnout.
2. Get a Master's in some historical subject. Unlikely and not a good idea since I'll just get an equally worthless Master's degree, plus burnout potential.
3. Get a Master's in some other subject. It's a possibility, but it will cost a lot of money. Plus burnout potential. Plus my GPA is already too garbage for most of these programs anyway.
4. Apply to a lower-ranked school and go back as an undergrad. I can pray that they'll give me some financial assistance, and theoretically the classes shouldn't grade as harshly maybe. That being said getting a degree from a no-name school might not help very much. Plus burnout potential of course.
5. Do an associate's in some sort of trade. Most of these seem to be in healthcare though, which I have absolutely no interest in, so I might just end up burning out of those too. They do tend to be a lot cheaper, so I might be able to work it financially. In the very worst case, I could just attempt to do some associate's in business administration and just go be a low-paid office clerk. I'd hate the job but it would pay a hell of a lot more than fast food, have mostly reasonable hours, etc.
6. Yolo into an apprenticeship or trade school. Good future potential and an apprenticeship gets me pay. Downside is that I have a leg problem; I can still walk and do some manual labor tasks, I just don't know if I can keep doing it 10 years down the line. Still, man's gotta earn money.
7. Don't go back to school immediately. On the plus side, it gives me a lot of time to reflect and actually figure out what the hell I want to do, and might help with the burnout. In the meantime, I will need to find a job though. If it pays enough, I might be able to save up enough to go back to school. But if all I can get is some minimum wage fast food job, I guess I'll just kiss my future goodbye. Especially since I probably can't expect my parents to pay for my education 5 years down the line.

After receiving overwhelming praise and approval on r/getdisciplined, I decided to post this here as well, I genuinely wish that people get at least some sense of what helped me pull this off, among many other feats. It never was, and never is too late to start.

On April of 2019, I was a complete mess. I'm talking absolute dumpster fire levels of mess. My girlfriend of 18 months had left me without a proper explanation, I had put on 20 pounds in just 2 months, my GPA had dropped from a respectable 3.2, to 2.4. I had simply let go of the reins of my life. Didn't care about anything, didn't strive towards anything. One day, on April 27th, after having cried for 3 hours that day, I decided to change the direction of my life and pull myself back together. Today is April 27th, 2021. My GPA is 3.6, I am back in my healthy weight range, and I'm planning on getting married with my current partner after I graduate.

With the following tips, I will give you some insight that you may find valuable:

**1) The most important part of your day, is right after you wake up**

It's pretty much the defining moment of your upcoming day. What you first do in those few minutes drastically affects the outcome of the limited 16\~ hours you have. If you choose to open up Reddit or Instagram or whatever social media app you use (I for one, was probably addicted to Reddit at the time), or open up a video game that essentially adds nothing of significance to your life besides a handful of pleasurable moments, it is extremely likely that you will succumb to the deceptive appeal of them. They will gulp down your time and make you feel guilty every night, when that ephemeral 1 AM motivation both riles you up and leaves you resentful.

The solution? After washing your face and going to the bathroom if you need to, simply force yourself to study. Even if it takes an immense amount of focus and self-discipline, just open up your textbook or lecture and start studying. Don't worry, the human body is more than capable of enduring a forced study session. After a while, it turns into a natural and routine activity (sounds crazy if you've never experienced it).

**2) Schedule your time**

I bet you've heard this everywhere, from everyone you deem at least slightly responsible. I was always the type of person to say ""Yeah whatever, I'll do this tomorrow, it's not like the deadline is coming up anytime soon"". Except, as you might predict, I uttered this sentence internally every day, for every school-related assignment and general matters regarding my personal future. Nightmare ensued quite frequently, project deadlines piling up, having to pull all-nighters to pass classes, think of every single consequence of horrible time management (or lack thereof).

The solution? Pull up your notes app, a journal, a planner, a notebook, a piece of paper, whatever you can get your hands on, and start making a plan for tomorrow. Allocate time for your responsibilities. However, it is crucial you don't lie to yourself. ""Oh yeah, I'll study statistics for 2 hours, some time tomorrow"", does not work. You have to specify the start and end period of every activity you plan on completing. ""I'll study statistics from 1 PM to 3 PM"", sounds and works much better.

**3) Limit the input you receive**

The time we live in is truly grandiose. If one thing is for sure, life has never been faster before. Just think about how much information your brain has to process in a given hour. Every day, we surf through the web and countless apps, see so many ads, take in fruitless information. Take Reddit for example, you picked this app/website to spend some time within, then picked this specific subreddit to look at this specific post. There were probably millions of other posts you could have looked at, yet you picked this one. Pat yourself on the back for not losing two hours by browsing Top All Time in a meme subreddit (no offense to them, you get the idea). Your brain tends to get weary and reluctant to read a book or study after you get your daily dose of worthless internet knowledge, which kills your drive.

The solution? Limit what you perceive. You don't have to know which celebrity is having a baby or some obscure fact that adds no value to society. I personally do not use YouTube except for tutorials and lectures regarding my education, and avoid Reddit other than r/getdisciplined, r/GetMotivated and r/study. I also strictly avoid the news. Last news piece I've seen was the ship that got stuck in the Suez Canal. I'm certain this methodology can be applied to your own personal social media platforms. Last but not least, do not watch pornography.

**4) Utilize the available resources**

You do not have to be alone in your journey towards becoming a productive dynamo. No one will congratulate you for accomplishing something without outside help. They will congratulate you for actually accomplishing it, because people exclusively care about outcomes, not about how you do it. It is okay to use the tools the world has to offer you. Here are the resources I choose to employ:

**a) Dive**

Dive, otherwise known as The Dive App, is a website that matches you with an accountability buddy. You meet them, talk about what you want to achieve during that session, and start studying. Having always been someone that is filled with a greater sense of duty when I'm studying with a peer, I was able to get through many demanding hours of studying. I have probably studied with hundreds if not thousands of different people through this website. Some of them have become lifelong friends.

[Dive](http://thedive.app/dive)

**b) Waking Up**

This is a meditation app developed by and with renown author, philosopher and neuroscientist Sam Harris. I'd say this one is not a mainstream meditation app, it rather dives into the greater meaning behind why people meditate. I mainly use this app to not experience burnouts, to remember not to take the people that care for me for granted, and experience the dazzling beauty of my surroundings with greater awe.

[Android Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wakingup.android&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US)

**c) Habit Tracker**

I have tried many habit or progress tracking apps to help me refocus when my mind occasionally goes out of bounds, this one helped me a lot in the past two months since I started reading Atomic Habits. The overall design is pretty nice, user interface is above what you would expect from an app of this sorts, and it allows you to track your friends' habits as well, paving the way for peer accountability. Unfortunately, there are different versions for Android and Apple, although they essentially work the same.

As the great businessman Mark Cuban once said: 

*“The only thing in your control is effort. That’s all, and that’s everything.”*

**Book Suggestions:**

*Make Your Bed by William McRaven*

Excellent book that gives out methodical rules on how to live a responsible and easier life. McRaven is a retired US Navy Admiral who was personally involved in the capture of Saddam Hussein. His advice on how to live is doubtlessly golden.

*Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins*

This man literally does not give up. If you're able to do at least a quarter of what this man has done in his respective professions (being a NAVY Seal and an ultra-marathon runner) you can amount to tremendous achievements you could have never even dreamt of.

*The Marshmallow Test by Walter Mischel*

For the folks that require scientific and psychological background knowledge on how things work and how the human mind operates, look no further than this book. Contains wide array of examples of people that put long term goals ahead of short term desires.

*Atomic Habits by James Clear*

Similar to The Marshmallow Test, yet it delves more into how to keep the cold limbic system in command automatically and build lifelong habits that transcend the short term goals that the person had set for themselves. It's probably THE book on successful habit creation.

I'm the youngest child in my family, and my older siblings didn't have great reputations in high school (one of them even dropped out). Because of this, my teachers expected the same out of me and didn't really give me a fair chance. Not only that, but my peers looked at me the same way. Nobody in my high school thought I would ever amount to anything. Obviously they were wrong, but I internalized all of this and really doubted myself during first year. I pushed through though and realized I wasn't the person everyone believed I was. 

Even within my friend group now, I don't really feel respected. Many of my friends attended one of the top business schools, while I just attended an average university for my BA. They really look down on liberal arts students and laugh about my school in general, which makes me kind of ashamed in all honesty. Because I know they're not alone in thinking these things about my major/my school, I catch myself constantly downplaying my achievements and being incredibly self-deprecating before anyone else can make a joke. 

Finally, my family has been less than supportive throughout all of this. I don't exactly blame them since none of them have gone through this and they don't really know how to support me, but I've never even once heard them say they're proud of me. A huge reason why I wanted to go to university was to make them proud, and I feel like they don't even care. They can't even tell you what my major is, no matter how many times I've told them over the past 4 years. 

I know I should feel so proud of myself for completing university and proving everyone wrong. I honestly feel like I had all the odds against me, but I came out alright. It's just hard to feel proud of my accomplishments when nobody around me is even acknowledging them. The only person who truly seems to be proud of me is my sibling that dropped out because even though our paths were very different, they were able to see how hard it was for me to get here, and they're happy that I was able to do what they never got the chance to. 

Tldr; nobody around me seems to acknowledge how hard I worked to get to graduation, and my ""friends"" are constantly putting me down for my major/school.

I want to share a bit of my life with everyone because I want to be able to reach out to someone who's currently having a hard time in their life. I assure you, you are not alone and your cries of help are being heard by me and many others.

Just a bit about me, Im a 2nd year college student currently attending a Cal State University. I have been on the Dean's List twice already and have a GPA of 3.45 ! It may not seem much to some people but I am insanely proud of where I am now. I could write a book about my experiences if I could, lol. I've had alot of my trust be put into jeopardy and people lie yo me constantly.  

I constantly told myself life would be easier if I didn't have so many health problems. I have a kidney disease, had two spinal surgeries (for scoliosis), asthma, and a bit of an esting disorder. I've suffered from all of this since I was born and I had to experience my high school and middle school to the best of my ability. I had my spinal surgery during middle school during 8th grade. I had to be put into home schooling to recover and when I tried to go back to school, i couldn't keep up with the workload because of the severe pains I was having. It tore apart my education and as an honors roll student I was so devastated. At the same time, one of my teachers would bully me. Telling me to go home and that I was too weak. She excluded me from potentionally life-saving educational opportunities that could have really helped me. She picked her favorite students and guided them towards their college goals while I was left wondering if she really liked me. I became severly depressed because of this.

I lost all my friends because I stopped showing up to school and they simply just stopped talking to me. They also made fun of my health conditions so yeah fuck them. I had to go to therapy because I was contemplating suicide and was so afraid to return back to school and face these teachers who said awful things to me. I was very shy and timid and was always taught never to raise my voice at my teachers so of course I stayed quiet about it. Until I broke down crying in front of my parents and told them that the teachers weren't giving me an opportunity to catch up on homework and give me the time of day to learn. I was in therapy for about 6 years. 

Then high school came, I was in and out of in-person schooling because of the pains and because I had my 2nd spinal surgery. No one called me up asking if I was okay. I spent my days on twitter, youtube, and tumblr learning how to draw, paint, write, and pretty much everything I could ever do. My home schooling teachers were absolute shit, they weren't even my teachers they just dropped off my school work and left lol. I had to teach myself Algebra 2 using just the book. I felt fucking stupid, but despite everything I still got honors roll. I complained about the discrimmination of students with health disqabilities to my high school and they ignored me. I would pass out in the hallways and the next day Id show up half dead because I dragged my ass to English class. The teachers would call me lazy and tell me I wasn't doing enough.

I wondered if anyone really understood the pain I was going through. Having to deal with depression and schooling at the same time was no joke. I unfortunately had severe anxiety and if my grade dropped lower than a C i would cry and pass out. I taught myself Math, History, English, literally everything in the fucking world. Because the support the school offered wasn't enough, when I asked for AP home schooling classes they denied me. I ended up being rejected from most Cal States and UCs because of that. I was so angry and frustrated, i felt humiliated in front of my peers. My Class Year had a 65% acceptance to UCs average. I felt completely lost.  The people I used to call my friends were attending Columbia, UCSB, UCLA, UCI. I cried so hard, it was impossible for me to feel better. 

Then I devised a plan to transfer to a UC in the future after spensing 2 years at a university. I entered the only Cal State that accepted me (I kind of regret it lol) and set the path towards my goal to transfer out. I wish someone in high school had informed me that I could have gone to community college and used TAG (transfeer admission guarantee). I had no idea that existed. My high school failed me big time. I guided myself where I went in life. I cried so many nights, and had no one to talk to. I felt compeltely alone and the help of my family wasn't much better either.

I've been volunteering as an ambassador for a charity for 12 years. (Not anymore) They took advantage of me when they tried to use me as a tax relief deposit in my first year of uni. They gifted me a BMW thst ended up being dog-shit. Like literally 250k miles, a bad motor, and a bad battery. And they wrote it off as a 5k gift to me in a tax form. I felt completrly betrayed but thsn I stood up for myself and refused to accept the car. I just felt so proud of myself for standing up against what they tried to make me do. It fueled me in my college years to keep going strong. I started studying more, looking up sources for CSU TO UC transfer. I still cried alot, but I felt at peace. I still dont have any friends but Im hoping to fix that one day. 

I applied for transfer to all UCs and USC for this Fall Semester 2021. I go waitlisted to UC Davis and UCSC for Political Science and I'm still waiting on UC San Diego and USC. It may not seem like much but the waitlist means the world to me to know that I am capable of going far beyond anyone's words and that my hardwork does pay off. I feel immensely proud of . Cal State Transfers are always last to be picked when it comes to transferring to another four year university so I literally jumped for joy at my odds defying everything I thought of previously. I feel like I can do anything. 

My parents were extremely toxic at some points and supportive in others. They have seen how much I suffered and I only hope with time they will realize that everything I've worked hard on happens for a reason. 

My depression and anxiety still exist, but I am hay to say I no longer feel that gut wrenching voice asking me if I even have a will to live. I still get severe panic attacks when I think about my rejection letters. I look back at my high school and middle school life and wish I was brave enough to face against the people who hurt me the most. I always promise myself that I will get past my hardships and hope to overcome everything I've suffered from.

Despite the lonely nights where I wish I had friends to play Valorant with or go to the movies with. I know maybe someday, i'll meet people who treat me nicely and support me. There's alot of paths I wish I took differently, but I can't change the past. I can only look toward my future. I know that life can be tough and you don't see yourself living past a certain point but everything gets easier with time. You don't need anyone but yourself to tell you that you're an amazing person and that you're capable of great things. You are an exceptional human being with great qualities and just because someone tells you something differently does not change the feelings you have for yourself. Your ambition is strong and it will drive you great places.

527,spoodydoo,1619527144,/r/college/comments/mzniyd/worrying_intensely_about_the_future_if_college_is/,"(Disclaimer: *HUGE* wall of text but I figured this is the best place for it)

So now that the reality has actually hit me...that I’m actually accepted and going to be transferring to a legitimate recognizable state university in a few months...I’m terrified. 

Here’s the thing: I’ve been doing extensive “research” (*ahem* excessive reading and panicking) regarding the whole, “picking a major”, “return on investment”, “student loan debt”, yadda yadda yadda.

I have anxiety, so any uncertainties regarding the future are making me crazy, and my problem is that I’m sorta lost on what to do. My parents insist I continue my education *now*, as they fear that if I stop now, then I won’t go back (which I don’t blame them; college is *incredibly* draining and mental issues don’t help). 

The problem is that they sorta fault me for “not knowing what I want to do, when I had two years of community college to figure it out”. *The**thing**is*, up until about three weeks ago, I was dead-set on going for a bachelors in arts. For the college I’m committing to, I even submitted a drawing/painting portfolio for their visual arts program. I *was* excited, more than anything else, and wasn’t even worrying...until I took a look at these forums. 

The opinions of others on the college, jobs, and career subreddits have essentially driven me into panic mode. If I understood sooner the reality that a visual arts degree will only make me hate my one passion *and* leave me riddled with debt for a worthless subject, I would’ve had more time to do some soul searching. 

The general consensus seems to be that the only degrees with a good return on investment are those in Business (accounting), STEM (especially computer sci and engineering) and/or healthcare (nursing). Anything else (aka, where all my interests lie, like writing, researching, drawing and painting) and I’m just setting myself up for failure. That mentality doesn’t help someone like myself who, as of two weeks ago, now has been having persistent anxiety and panic attacks that were under control for years until this happened; I’m having immense trouble sleeping, heart palpitations, frequent bouts of crying from stress, and can’t stop my mind from racing. I browse these forums for almost half of the day (*easily* 4-6 hours); I can’t stop thinking about it; the classes I’m trying to finish for graduation haven’t been getting *any* of my focus. 

After careful thinking I’m considering a Communications degree in Public Relations/Advertising (with maybe even a minor in Journalism or Digital Literacy) to be my best bet at hopefully *not* being completely miserable in my studies. I’m kinda socially-anxious and introverted but also willing to step out of that comfort zone if it means I have better prospects. I can be technical/kinda fixated in my writing and communicating with others, but anything math-focused or heavy in the sciences leaves me super drained and frustrated. A STEM major is simply not in my cards, unless I wanna be in a major and job that I despise. I admire the STEM and other math-heavy majors, believe me, but I’ve always been more creative-centered and a visual learner (math makes me cry lol; the last math class I took in my cc I got a C+ in, and I dropped pre-calc a month in because I simply couldn’t understand it and was taking guesses while failing the quizzes).

If I wasn’t so sure that I wouldn’t return, I would take some time off to really think about it and get a job. However, child support ends the moment I stop going to school, and my parent on disability needs that income for the time being. Also, I get aid to pay for most of my schooling (cc was basically free), and the college I’m currently enrolled in has a special program for incoming Fall students like myself that guarantees full-coverage of tuition for anything aid doesn’t cover if I’m under the required criteria (I am, so the only expenses I would really have to focus on would be room and board). I’m planning on talking to the university offices about federal work study to get a paid job position on-campus, or even getting a part-time job off-campus, to help pay for some of the dorm costs (hopefully at least half, or even a third). If I get a summer job I will save up 90-100% of that income for school expenses. I also plan on taking advantage of internship opportunities, and getting into at least one, if not two of them, as well as a few clubs. I want to take advantage of these things to at least make up for the job experience I *don’t* have yet, as up until now I’ve just been a full-time student, while my parents provide me with my needs (and wants) that I feel I definitely don’t deserve.

I’m terrified of loans and the thought of having to pay them back especially if I can’t get a job once I graduate, because then my parents would have to help, and I would feel guilty. I’ll likely have to take out at *least* 15k-20k in loans, if not more (possibly up to 30k), and even though a lower wage job (like $15 per hour) *could* surely help pay those off (since I’ll just be moving back in with my parents after graduation *anyway*) I’m still terrified. I know about the whole “don’t take out more loans than what you expect your first year salary to be”, and I want to ideally keep it under 25k since I honestly have no idea what jobs will be available for me after graduation. My other parent has a six-figure income and is willing to help, but I’d rather just make them proud so I wouldn’t have to feel like I’m mooching off of them for more money. 

I always think of the worst-case scenario with the anxiety disorder I have. I even have it cemented in my mind that if things *really* turn out too bad or overwhelming afterwards, and it feels like there’s no hope, then I’ll just &gt;!end my life or something!&lt; . You can call me a coward or something all you want, but my anxiety once got so bad that I wouldn’t leave my bed, was crying for many hours of every day, and lost 55 pounds in two months due to starvation. Yes, I know I have a problem; I’ve lived it for 5+ years. Yes, I see a therapist. I’m also speaking a bit with my cc’s career counselor, who has given me a few objectives of info to research. The reassurance from my therapist and counselor that “we’ll definitely have a plan” before the Fall semester begins at least gives me a little bit of relief. 

At the end of the day, if I can keep my loans under 30k or so, and I can see myself through the next 2 years at this university, then a degree in general has higher prospects than *no* degree, right? Unless you’re going into a trade, the consensus seems to be that you can’t move up a ton in the job market without one unless you’re lucky or a genius. My one parent wants me to do what makes me happy (which seems like financial sabotage), while the other wants me to go into graphic design (where I have no experience and would essentially be starting from scratch, again, with a career that seems like a bad idea). 

According to my readings, graphic design is an over-saturated market with poor prospects, English is only good if you’re planning to be a teacher (the one thing I *never* want to be is a teacher), and communications is “too broad” (but at least with this degree program, there are three subsections I can choose from: PR/Advertising, Journalism/general, or Media Production/Film/Television). PR/Advertising seems like the most lucrative pick as a major from that group, and I have a college friend, as well as another friend with two older brothers, who all have Communications degrees with decent jobs. 

And Fine Arts: drawing, the thing I’ve been doing since I was a little kid, the one thing I always told my school teachers I wanted to do, the “cartoonist” and “animator” dreams...will have to remain a hobby or side-hustle through freelance. My mom saw me working for Pixar...my dad saw me working for Nickelodeon...all things I will be putting aside. At the end of the day, if I end up poor and homeless in my 30’s, I suppose I at least want to have a sketchbook and a pencil to draw, without a career having killed that hobby. If I can do something that I relatively tolerate for a decent pay (40k annually is what I’m shooting for, but even 35k is fine as I’ll likely be living with my parents until I can’t anymore) then I’m fine with that. I’m not shooting for the moon here...I kinda hope to land among the stars though. 

If there’s any advice, or even comfort, as to what I should do or what I’m doing that you may have for me, from somebody, *anybody*, I would really appreciate it. I know nothing is ever guaranteed in this world, especially not the future of the job market, but I hope that at least getting a degree in *something* will prove as an achievement enough to get me somewhere in life. 

Or I’ll just give up and kick the bucket in ten years. We’ll see what happens. 

**TL;DR - I’m terribly stressed about what the future holds for a less lucrative degree, but I know if I go for something that has more solid job prospects and bigger salary that I’d be absolutely miserable, probably not be the most efficient worker anyway, or even drop out altogether. I know you don’t have to “love” your job or career field, but I don’t want the rest of my life to be anymore depressing or mentally taxing than it already is, as someone with mental things goin on.

528,slothdawgmillionaire,1619498391,/r/college/comments/mzglxv/after_struggling_with_imposter_syndrome_i_a/,"I started my bachelor's degree 10 years ago, as a last resort to keep from being homeless. My mom, a struggling alcoholic, was unable to help me out of high school, and the residence halls at college was the only last minute option. I didn't want to go to college. 

(My background is important, as it it helps explain what my experience at college with Imposter Syndrome was like.)

I come from a low-income family of substance abusers, high school drop outs, and trauma. My father didn't make it through 8th grade and my mom dropped out in 9th, though eventually getting her GED. This is not to say she was not smart. Intelligence extends far outside of the academic institution. My father inevitably chose drugs and played a part in the dysfunction of my childhood, as I had to move every year, sometimes twice a year. Eventually, my grandmother gained custody of me (though she was far from stable, as well). Basically, I left one hell hole for another. 

Through out my childhood, my mother preached and pushed education, always pushing me for AP classes, extra curriculars, scholars bowl, band, and a part time job. She always told me that education would be my only way out of the generational trauma and cycle. I do not agree with her, though she tried her best. 

The Imposter Syndrome peaked it's head my freshman year of college. Mixed with instability and loneliness, the Imposter Syndrome was able to make me feel like I did not belong in school. I was always feeling a disassociation with the environment there and the monstrosity I come from, as well as the culture and social perspective of all the later generation students. 
I was working full-time trying to make ends meet. I struggled balancing this with marching band and student government association. My GPA at the time was less than a 2.3. I barely was getting by. I over exerted myself for perfection, and had to ""prove myself"" to others. I felt depressed and lonely. 

A year before graduating with my bachelor's I ran out of money and had to work for a year and a half to save and finish. I also had to file for dependency override. I went back to school taking 20 hours in one semester, while working full time at a fast food restaurant. I ended up passing with all A's. I overcome my first battle, but this wasn't enough to warrant me walking across that stage. I still regret not walking. 

This past year with the pandemic, I, on a whim applied for graduate school. I did not have the minimum GPA, but I wrote a genuine letter and pushed myself to communicate with the purest and rawest form of myself. I was accepted. With the help of my husband, I overcame Imposter Syndrome and am graduating next week with a 4.0 GPA. I wrote about Imposter Syndrome in first-generation students recently, and found it therapeutic. I finally acknowledged that I belonged, I am not a fraud, and I did it! 
You can bet that I will be walking across the stage this time with my head held high, and with my now sober mom in the audience. 

Anyways, thanks for reading! I hope you push through anything life throws at you, and give it to yourself.

Three colleges that I applied to recently got back to me saying I wouldn't be accepted because I dropped out of uni (2016) and cannot get transcripts from them to ""transfer"". One school even said I couldn't even start as a freshman!

I can't get the transcript because I haven't fully paid owed tuition. While I was still a student, I managed to pay half ($23,000) but still owed about $20,000 by the end of the year. I couldn't pay before summer was over and I don't have credit for a loan, so I agreed to do monthly payments. The uni wouldn't let me back in until my debt was paid, regardless of me promising to pay. So I had to drop out. 

Eventually, I lost the ability to pay the $400/month to the university, so they sent my bill to collections. So *technically*, I don't owe the school, I owe some company. 

Fast-forward to now, I'm being told that despite all this, I still can't start as an undergrad. I don't have great credit, working on it but it's hard when you're born into a bad financial situation. AnyWAY! I wanna get a 4-year degree, like legit will study anything, I don't care, I just want a job that can pay my bills!

I wanted to hear some experiences from non-traditional students and especially if you have any learning disabilities or psychiatric conditions. I barely graduated High School with my diploma during the No Child Left Behind era and high school students were required to pass a set of standardized exams in order to obtain their diplomas, unfortunately, I have a math disability and barely passed the Math examination after 5 times, but the other exams I was able to eliminate with some difficulty. The whole experience weakened my self-esteem and I spent a year stuck in my bedroom with the events replaying in my head. I eventually went to a trade school but the proprietors filed for bankruptcy and I was out in the world again. Since then I worked various odd jobs but I'm still living with my relatives to get by and hopefully one day succeed, which probably won't be until I'm in my 30s since I'm going to be 26 soon. I enrolled at a local cc passed a couple of classes with bs, but I made a mistake with the current class and I submitted the assignments in the wrong section so now my grade is at a 46%.

I live in Idaho and have wanted to go to the University of Idaho for as long as I remember, but instead accidentally applied to the College of Idaho due to my haste to get it over with and continue hanging out with my friends. Somehow I didn't realize these schools were different and ended up getting accepted to the College of Idaho with a 17k scholarship believing it was the school I wanted to attend. I forgot about it and just had fun with my last few months of high school. In that time my overall unweighted GPA dropped from 3.97 to a 3.78 due to some college dual credit classes and a lot of fun, which could affect my scholarship but I have no idea. Then when I was trying to setup housing for a college I was never accepted at, I realized my fatal mistake and how I've thrown away this entire year so far. I immediately applied for the University of Idaho because that is the school I'd still love to go to specifically for an engineering degree but haven't heard back. I also never applied for any other colleges or scholarships during scholarship season because it flew by with friend drama, school, and work. I realize I'm really stupid and that I've thrown away my past self's hard work, but does anyone have any advice? Do you think I will get accepted this late for the fall season? Does my drastic GPA change with this year affect my chances of not only acceptance but any slim chance at any scholarship this late? Will it be worth it to change majors and pursue something at the College of Idaho even though I dislike its location, cost, and environment? Maybe just stay, use the few college credits  I've gotten to finish an associate's quickly, and transfer to U of I later? Any advice would be appreciated? Don't be gentle, I realized I messed up. Just hit me with anything you've got.

Also, side note, I believed 17k to be a lot more when I thought I was going to U of I since it's a public school instead of the astronomically priced private institution the College of Idaho is which contributed to my laziness in scholarship season. I know this is stupid and that I should have just gotten everything I could, but I was distracted. So here I am in this crazy situation, I honestly don't know how I even got here and how I didn't realize earlier, but anything would be appreciated, and I don't know if this is even the place to post but I will gladly post somewhere else if anyone had some ideas.

540,JustAnotherBird13,1618417716,/r/college/comments/mqu8fn/can_i_get_some_other_peoples_thoughts_on_my/,"TL;DR: 

looking for advice regarding what would be the most sensible degree choice to make regarding career aspirations.

 Physics, Philosophy, Human Systems engineering, Electrical engineering, Digital culture, or Biololgy.

I've got about 60 credit hours to my name, all of them are just the basic courses and a second language. I dropped out about 2 years ago because 1.) I had to deal with a rather sudden and upheaval of my mental health, and 2.) I lost interest in my subject (linguistics). Now, I'm in a better spot and even have a job that will pay for my tuition! I want to be back in school so badly. The fact that I don't have a degree by 24 makes my really sad, makes me hate myself.

After 2 years, lots of soul searching, and a lot reading, I've been able to get a better grasp on what it is that actually interest me and why. What it boils down to, is that there are questions I like to think about, and I want a career in which I can find work in pursuing at least one of them. The problem is, is that the questions I want to think about are rather spread out, at least as far as academic disciplines go. I scanned all the degrees that my college offers that I can take and these are what catch my eye and why:

Physics: Specifically, I would want to study either plasma physics or condensed matter physics, as these fields both have massive potential for the creation of new technologies in the future. beyond that, I've just had a long standing desire to understand the subject. I've read (and still do read) a mountain of books on the subject, and I love both the creativity that the field inspires in me, and the beauty that its understanding gives the world.

Philosophy: (My current degree) I'm not nearly as in love with this field as I am the more technical ones that I enjoy. I just see this as an unavoidably important subject that it doesn't hurt to have some education in. I feel like this is a subject maybe better studied in my spare time, but idk. it just feels like it would be unfulfilling as a career.

Human Systems Engineering: I like that this field combines both psychology and its real time applications to the ways that we interact with the world. I feel like it would be rewarding if it could turn  into a career in which I can help design things that make peoples' lives better.

Electrical Engineering: Somewhat similar to HSE. I've always loved thinking about energy systems, specifically, I like thinking about how to invent new ones. This kind of loops back into my interest in physics. I would absolutely love a career that would allow me to be a part of building/researching energy sources and harnessing them. (specifically, fusion power, and propulsion systems for spacecraft)

Digital culture: I like to think about how the human experience is affected by the digital dimension, and how we can best navigate it as it expands. Not sure how any careers would play out with this one.

Biology: I have been interested in the question of ""what is life"" since I was a little kid. It always fascinated me to think about the sheer weirdness of form creatures take, and we ourselves came to be. I also have a deep desire to understand in a quantitative way, the question of ""when does life start"". like when does a system go from ""a system that is processing information"" to ""alive""?

Anybody have any advice for me? The only really holding me back right now is 1.) option paralysis, and 2.) my confidence in my math skills. I missed out on most of high school due to mental health problems, so I never really internalized much. over the last month I've managed to reteach myself basic algebra, and I'm determined to not stop teaching myself math, ever. I'm fairly determined to make a career in academia, and I study constantly, everyday. I even get up early to do so, so that I can study for a few hours before work. like I said, I'm determined. but feel stuck.

So I dropped out of high school at 16 and got my GED and then spent a year in cosmetology school. 
Realized I hated the general public very quickly and I then worked for the prison system for 1 1/2 yrs. 

At that point in my life I’m an adult and living on my own and I meet my now husband. I grew up pretty poor and was only able to barely afford the local community college trade school program because my grandfather set aside a few thousand dollars. 
I never thought about going to a 4 yr school or that having a serious career would be something I could afford without going into a ton of debt. Now I’m lucky enough to be married and my husband has a steady job with the military and plans on doing a full 20. He doesn’t plan on using his GI bill and has offered it to me. He makes enough money that he can support us both without me having to work and go to school. Now that I’m married and older I qualify for a lot more grants etc. Except that’s never been something I’ve thought about. I didn’t enjoy school and left. I love my husband and unfortunately I’m well aware that I’m nowhere near as book smart as he is. I’m really scared to enter college with a failed sophomore level education. Hell I haven’t even put any thought into what I would enjoy. I don’t know what to do. It’s never something I thought I would be able to do. My husband is going to college to become an officer but I don’t want to be the dumb uneducated stay at home mom for the rest of my life. For him it’s exciting to talk about all the things he could major in, he’s insanely smart, like could become an engineer or doctor level smart and I’ve just never been on that level. I feel weird expressing this to him because for him the world is his oyster and for me I’m terrified I’m going to look like an idiot and waste a ton of money and time. 


So how do I deal with navigating finding what I want to peruse as a career for the rest of my life now that my financial status isn’t holding me back? 
And how do I deal with my mental roadblock about being too stupid for higher education?

543,jade-chanell,1617392127,/r/college/comments/mirrnx/college_math_class_for_someone_who_sucks_at_math/,"To give you some background: I was behind a year in math - I took pre-algebra in 9th grade when the rest of the kids took Algebra. I had to take a 2nd math class (math enrichment) in 11th grade because I failed a semester of Algebra 1 in 10th grade. I also dropped my Algebra 2 class in 12th grade because I was failing and only needed 3 years of math in order to graduate.

Now I have to decide between taking College Algebra or Fundamentals of Mathematics, and I would just take Fundamentals because it would be a bit easier, but admission to my program is competitive and based on the number of admission points you earn. An A in Fundamentals is worth only 5 admission points, which is the same point value as a C in Algebra. An A in Algebra is worth 30 points, but I can't remember the last time I got above a C or D in any math class since elementary school.

If you were me, what class would you take?  Keep in mind I work full-time, I'd be taking the class this summer so it would be an accelerated pace, I've been out of school for 7 years, and I have to get at least a C to qualify for admission to my program.",college,College math class for someone who sucks at math?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/mirrnx/college_math_class_for_someone_who_sucks_at_math/,1617410127.0
544,anairda0715,1617240259,/r/college/comments/mhkjje/i_am_having_trouble_deciding_where_i_should_go_to/,"So let me start from the beginning even though it may be too much context.

I've always been a gifted child since kindergarten or so I've been told which led to me always taking advanced/accelerated/college-level classes. However, junior and senior year of high school I have been extremely burnt out because of the sheer quantity of these classes I've been taking and the only reason I didn't fail during lockdown and online learning is because all sports were canceled and I had time to do my work since in a normal year I am in school sports from August until the end of April.

I didn't find out I was severely burnt out until this year and I've decided I want to stop over achieving as much because I've lost time for hobbies these past four years as well as my relationships with my family members since I would only ever have like 2 hours of free time a day before covid. Because of this I also changed my mind to stay near home.

Therefore, my plan for college became to go to a community College near my home since I would like to also experience living on campus away from home but maybe later on when I spend more time in my hometown and with my family. It also helps financially because I would pay at most $2,000 a year and thanks to my high-school GPA and financial status, I will be paying less because of a state scholarship and financial need. I also don't really know what I want to study either so I think I should take these years to figure it out. 

My problems arise with first my parents saying that I shouldn't go to a community College since only ""dumb people"" go there who dropped put of high school, which doesn't make sense but keep in mind they are immigrants who only went to 6th grade and then dropped out because they needed to start working because they were so poor. They have used me a lot to brag to our family members that are more well off since their kids have dropped out or weren't above average students. The problem here isn't them saying this since I know it's not true and going to community College is a respectable route but it did spark a bit of uncertainty in me. Especially since every teacher/counselor at my highschool is visiy shocked and confused about why I would go to a community College and I feel as if I may be wrong. For more info: I am 3/500+ students in my grade since they rank us by GPA so I guess I understand the shock. Not relevant to the problem but the fact that for the past four years my high school has told us community College is nothing to be ashamed of and yet reacts this way is ironic.

Another issue arose today as I found out the community College I wanted to go to is going to be 80% online. Now covid is easing up in my county and school turned to hybrid learning where half the school goes for two days a week for 4 hours. They have told us it is possible we will return to normal for theast weeks of school in May. So maybe the community College will ease on restrictions by the time I begin. 

Now my options financially are 3. The first is going to a nearby state university. Pros are that my parents want me to go here, state scholarships and financial aid show I will pay around the same as community College, will guarantee freshman on campus learning, and I can stay at home. Cons are that I don't want to stay here for all 4 years since I would also like to know whats its like to live on campus of a college (and yes I know its not all great. I want the whole experience nonetheless, the good and the bad). 

The second option is going to a UC university. Pros: state scholarships and financial aid would leave me only paying for books, I would live there for 4 years and get my on campus experience, and expected return to majority in person learning. Cons: I don't want to leave my hometown just yet, some financial aid is based on my GPA in college and I don't want that kind of pressure for four years because if I lose that aid I would be paying 10k a year and I have no college savings since 1) my family of 5 makes less than 35k a year and 2) my parents never saved for college since I was gifted and would probably get free rides (again they don't understand the college process). I have also not had a job before since I've never had time.

The third option and the one I would like is continuing with my plan to go to community College. Pros: allows for 2 years at home and 2 possible years away from home if I want to or if I change my mind I can go to a nearby state university, pretty cheap even without financial aid, allows me to think about what i want to do without financial or grades pressure, and i could save up money incase I transfer to a university that could charge me 10k a year. Cons: possible online learning and literally every adult telling me its a weird/wrong decision.

I know i have a problem with commiting to either leaving or staying home but thats why i wanted community college since i could do both without suffering financially. If anyone needs more info ill try to respond to comments or add edits but do keep in mind I've never posted on reddit before. In case you are wondering what option im leaning towards its the community college route since im around 75% certain its the one I want to choose but i would appreciate input and hear different viewpoints.",college,"I am having trouble deciding where i should go to college based on financial aid, location, and covid restrictions and would appreciate help",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/mhkjje/i_am_having_trouble_deciding_where_i_should_go_to/,1617258259.0

I am in Southern California.
If you don't know, this is [DACA](https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-of-deferred-action-for-childhood-arrivals-daca).
Basically my parents immigrated to US when I was young and we were considered illegal. With DACA I can never leave the country and I can stay in the US legally and work and pay taxes and thats it. However, legally, I am not considered a citizen or resident and do not qualify for any Fed aid or bank loans and many other things that aren't relevant to this.

I completed 2 and a half years at a state uni (2008-2010)(DACA was approved in 2012). Had to drop out because I didn't want to work 12hrs and be full time student (props to those that can!). At the time I dropped out I still owed $700 tuition. 


I was reading that there is financial aid at the state level for DACA students. 

Do credits expire? (Its been over 10 years)

I imagine I'd have start again through Community College?

I'm sure the uni still expects me to pay the $$ but haven't confirmed.

I transferred to a 4 year private college in Arizona to finish out my degree while also working in the field I was going to school for (BA of Social Work and worked for the Department of Child Safety). 

I had postpartum depression, depression and anxiety during this time from the stress of my job and from having my second child. I realized I hated the field I was in and will be changing my major.

After their dismissal and disregard for my mental health reasoning, I no longer want to give that school another dime and it has left a bad taste in my mouth. I don’t want to do the remedial work to return because I no longer want to attend there.

547,silvally7777,1617214478,/r/college/comments/mhc4en/experiencing_potential_burnout_due_to_my_uni/,"Hey guys, I just wanted to come on here and say how I'm feeling. I don't know if it'll actually make me feel better, but if anyone else feels the same I'd like to know. Just the feeling of knowing I'm not the only one is enough. I thought I'd just say I'm nonbinary and go by they/them pronouns. 

So I'm 20 years old, almost 21, and a junior in a 4 year university with no plans to go to graduate school. My major is cinema, and lately I've been having trouble with that fact. Now I've always loved my major. I can't see myself doing anything else. I've been so overwhelmed and stressed, I feel like I'm starting to hate my major. I never thought something like this would happen because I only just got into cinema, and I feel like I still haven't found the thing about it that I love the most. Basically, I feel like I haven't loved cinema enough, I was just getting started. It's been my major since freshman year, and I chose it because a professor inspired me and made me feel like I could actually do this. Unfortunately, due to covid and the department director, that professor is no longer teaching at my school. I've lost all contact with them sadly. I think this has greatly affected my love for the major. Since she left, I've felt like my enjoyment of cinema and the classes has been subdued. We were really close (this professor and me), and I really enjoyed our talks about movies and talking in general. I learned most of what I know of cinema from this professor. Sorry for talking so much about this one facet, but this has been very important to me for the years I've spent in college. To believe that I don't care for it anymore has really been messing with my sense of identity.

I was taking 4 4-credit courses until earlier this morning. I dropped a course today because it's been causing me so much mental anguish, stress, and anxiety, I just couldn't do it anymore. I don't think dropping that class is going to solve my issue though. If anything, I'll update on how I'm feeling after dropping that class. Maybe in a week or two, I'll feel better. Regardless, each semester since we've started learning online has felt like more and more of a struggle. I remember having my first panic attack on my birthday last spring semester. That whole day was spent stressing over a paper I had due, and I remember only being able to send it in 5 days later. Worst birthday ever lol. At the time, I was talking to a girl who eventually became my gf for a point in time, and she helped me through it. After that, I had more panic attacks this fall semester. I was dating the same girl I had been talking to, and she helped again, but I think it was too much. My mood was irritable most of the time because of stress, and I would have multiple breakdowns each week. There were times when I would just start crying because I felt overwhelmed. Fast forward to now, I am single, and due to this recent relationship and its abrupt ending, I am having a hard time being vulnerable with my feelings and trusting people. This relationship has changed me as an individual as it has greatly affected me and the way I interact with people. I have been crying practically everyday due to stress and just an overall feeling of being extremely overwhelmed with no escape. I find myself wondering a lot if I will ever be free from this feeling.

The point is, I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to about my feelings of potential burn out, stress, and anxiety. I don't like talking to my friends because I don't want to burden them with the way I feel. They try their best to be positive with me, but when it doesn't work, I just feel worse because I feel bad that they tried and still can't get through to me. When I talk to my parents, I don't feel any better. They tell me that I'm almost done so I can't put all the money they've put into my education, to waste. So I'm unable to drop out or take a semester off. I don't know if time off would even help honestly. Whenever I'm on break, I'm able to start feeling better, but after some time in school, I'm back to where I was before, or worse off. Each semester, the time I had before I would reach my limit would decrease. I lasted about 3 months into the semester last spring, a month and a half this fall semester, and 3 weeks this semester. I haven't felt this semester at all since the beginning, so I feel very far past my limit.

I think I should just say how I'm feeling overall. In general, I feel like shit. I have been severely depressed for a little over a month and a half now. I'm not really sure what exactly triggered it honestly. I hadn't been this depressed since high school. I thought I'd gotten better because I had become more spiritual during the beginning of quarantine up until my breakup. After the breakup, I was very down, but this feeling is somehow 100x worse. I feel so pessimistic, hopeless, worthless. I worry very often that I will amount to nothing in life. I hadn't had suicidal thoughts since my freshman year of high school. I stopped thinking that way so long ago, and this past semester was able to bring it out of me again. It's very demoralizing feeling like all my hard work on myself from over the years was undone in what seems like a second. Before dropping my class, I just felt very overwhelmed with the workload of all my classes. Granted, if I had gotten through this week, the workload would have lessened a lot because it's midterms week. I just couldn't do it. I have so much trouble focusing and thinking in general, nothing is coming to me. When I read for classes, I get nothing out of it, I can't remember anything. Writing essays is a literal nightmare, and it's most of what I've had to do as work. I have no mental or physical energy for it ever. No matter what I do, I just feel like nothing matters at all. I worry about feeling this way all my life, like what if it's not just school making me feel this way and work will eventually do the same. Am I just stuck in this cycle? Anyways, everything I loved to do, I've lost interest in over the past month. I don't do it anymore with passion. Everything feels like I'm wasting time if I'm not doing my schoolwork. I've also been battling with negative self talk, which also started up again for the first time since high school about a month ago. 

I've been trying to get help to solve my problems, but everything has been taking too long. I am very certain I have ADHD and I'm realizing more things every day that can be explained by it. I'm trying to get tested for it so I can get treated, but it's taking such a long time. Firstly, I couldn't afford it for a while since it's a great deal of money to get tested at my school (roughly half a grand, but I saved for a few months). I don't have a primary doctor that I can go to instead because I'm living near my school. My living situation is just really complicated. I don't really have the time to tell you guys my life story, but I'm just not able to get a doctor out here, and I don't know when I can go to a doctor again. I'm also setting up an appointment with my therapist again. I went to therapy for roughly a year, but it yielded very few results. I didn't want to waste my time, but I decided to try it again because if not anything else, I at least know I won't be judged for talking about how I feel. This feels urgent to me, but others quickly tend to invalidate my feelings. Since I'm so used to others invalidating the way I feel, I don't even know if I'm being dramatic or if this is something that is actually serious. This is why seeing if other people feel the same would help. 

Thank you for reading, I really appreciate it. I hope if any of you are going through the same thing, that you're able to get out of this pit soon. Wishing you all the best. I will most likely update this post in the future with how I feel in a few weeks.

TLDR: I've been feeling very overwhelmed and stressed over online school. I might be going through burnout, but I don't see a way to stop it because I'm unable to take a break. I've been trying my best to get help and get back on my feet, but everything feels hopeless. I can't find motivation for the things I love anymore. I just feel numb. Does anyone else feel the same?

549,RainRain_505,1616900258,/r/college/comments/met27m/roommate_advice_please/,"I (f19) am a second-semester freshman in college. Roommate applications for the 2021 fall semester are coming out and I am terrified. My first semester was incredibly difficult. I made the mistake of rooming with my best friend from home, and long story short in two weeks everything fell apart and I had to move out. For the few weeks after that, I didn't have any friends because my old roommate and the girls we shared a suite with didn't talk to me. But now 6 months later, everything is great. I love my new roommate, I found a small group of friends on campus I love and can be myself around, and I am honestly really, really happy. I have a very close friend on campus (f19) we'll call her Clara. Clara and I have been hanging out almost every day with our other friends. We go to school near the beach, so we collect sea glass together, go on adventures down by the rocks, and honestly if it wasn't for her I probably would've dropped out of school or transferred. I was in such a dark spot before I met her, I don't like to think about what would have happened if I hadn't met her. My current roommate is the best, and while we are friends we never ran with the same crowd, which worked great for us. She had her group of friends and I had mine, so we had good space from each other. However, my current roommate is going to live with a friend she made on campus next semester. So, my options are to either go random, or room with Clara. Clara and I have talked a lot about it and I finally agreed but I am so, so terrified. I am completely traumatized from my first experience of rooming with my best friend from high school and the disaster that ensued. We had known each other for 10 years and everything completely fell apart. There were a lot of things that happened: the girls in the suite were very catty, my old best friend was very bossy and kind of ordered me around the room. She was also the person where, if it wasn't the way she wanted it, she would be mad at you. Clara isn't like her at all, Clara is more like me in the sense where she is more introverted, very eccentric, and needs chill time to recharge when she loses her social battery. Clara really wants to room with me, and to be honest I want to room with her too. But I am so terrified, and I have been so anxious these past few days thinking about it. I learned that it is not a good idea to room with friends, but is it different because rather a best friend of 10 years it is a friend I met on campus 6 months ago? I really need some advice. I have only known Clara for 6 months, and we've gotten really close, I'm even close with her family. I want to make the right decision, and I can't repeat what happened this first semester, because I definitely won't survive it this time.

I'm pretty annoyed that I was even in the class in the first place. My advisor said it would be a good fit for what I was hoping to try out but it turned out to be an upper level class that i was in no way ready for or interested in. I should have dropped it before I couldn't without getting a ""W"" but it's too late now so oh well.

Anyways it's halfway through the semester, I still have an F, I don't think I could have gotten it above a D and so I decided to withdraw so as not to hurt my GPA. I would be losing my tiny scholarship either way so might as well keep the GPA untouched. 

However I'm a custodian at the school I work at, and I didn't realize that I need to be a full time student to be employed. After dropping that class my credits went down to 11 for this semester and I need 12 to be a full time student.

So not only do I still have all the stuff outside of school to deal with, Ive lost my scholarship, and I'm also potentially gonna lose my job.

My parents are gonna be pissed, I won't have a job to pay for the remainder of my tuition, and I'll be left feeling like an idiot for not thinking before acting.

I was raised by a single mother who was a drug addict, dad never paid child support, and even then I was able to get through high school with a 4.0 and good act scores.

I was so excited to go to my state university, KU. I’d finally be able to get away from my previous life and just be able to kick it in college. I had a decent amount of money saved up from working throughout high school, and got a couple of good scholarships from private sources, and a solid one from the university. All in all I was looking at only needing to pay ≈ 4K a semester. Fafsa was essentially no help, in fact I had to send a million and one documents just to get them to give me a grant instead of $25k unsubsidized loans. 

Then fucking COVID hit, I was there for about 2 weeks  because my roommate wasn’t following guidelines (I did try to get a room change but couldn’t, due to COVID concerns) and myself and my family are immunocompromised. So I dropped and moved back home, gave them all their scholarship money back, and patiently waited until I could go back. 

Now I didn’t want to waste time, so I decided to go to a local cc online so I don’t get rusty at schooling and whatnot. However I guess this is the fuck up as apparently colleges would rather you just sit on your fucking thumbs and do nothing during these times. 

They decided that because technically now I’m a transfer student, apparently every single bit of my financial situation is different, I no longer qualify for the good scholarship they were going to give me, okay whatever, i tho k that’s a bit unfair but it’s okay, they have transfer scholarships for less money, but it’s still manageable. 

Guess what? Those 2 fucking weeks, these two weeks where they probably didn’t even know I was there entirely disqualifies me for any transfer scholarships! Because basically I was at one point a “degree seeking student @ KU” so now I’m basically just fucked.

564,Hellopanda980,1614256362,/r/college/comments/ls5k39/too_dumb_for_college_i_dropped_out_of_univeristy/,"This post is going to sound whiny and I apologize in advance. I know reddit isn't a place for therapy, but I just want to let everything out and have someone to talk to. I'm sorry for the long post. I am not GREAT with words and am bad at summarizing. I don't really have anyone to talk to about this so I just want to thank you in advance for taking your time to read my post and talking to me.

Recently I was on pre-med track at my university and I dropped out because I realized that I didn't really want to go to medical school. I think I knew I didn't want to continue this path the first quarter I was there but, stuck it out because the university was prestigious, my parents were excited about me going to the school, and everyone around me went there. 

I ended talking to my advisors and they suggested I try to take other classes like accounting courses and nursing courses at my community college. Before going to university, I was a running start student so I already had college credits. I only had 2 more years to graduate and financial aid would only pay for 2 more years of my education, but I knew with just a biology degree...it would be hard to find a job in Washington state unless I went to medical school (which I don't have money for, no medical experience, and not really something I want to go through) or became a bio teacher (which was something I'm not passionate about). 

I ultimately dropped out of my university and now I am going community college for an AA degree in Pre-Nursing. I plan on applying to Nursing programs at other community colleges or possibly at another university in WA. 

However, learning from home has been really hard for me. I know a lot of students enjoy learning from home, but I think my anxiety worsened ever since the stay at home order.  I am confined to one room the whole day and i spend my days on Zoom, writing notes, ans studying. I barely have time to eat, sleep, or do anything I enjoy.

I feel as though I developed high functioning anxiety from my university. I know I sound dramatic, but before university I didn't care about minor details on assignments and breezed through school. As weird as it sounds, I actually loved going to school back then. 

I think this anxiety stemmed from almost failing a chemistry class at the University and meeting with an advisor and my teacher. I asked them ""if I fail, could I retake the course? What do you recommend me doing to succeed in class?"" They gave me a nonchalant and discouraging answer and told me: ""you were probably a star student at your community college and high school, but here you're just average, possibly lower than average. You're in a school FULL of star students."" That statement will never leave my head. From then on, I think I started obsessing over small mistakes on assignments and tests. For example, though community college is easier than university, I became anxious and angry at myself for getting a 79/80 on a recent microbiology test OR when I forgot a period in my sentences while writing lab protocols. I start thinking about this chain of events that start from a simple mistake like on a test and it eventually leads me being homeless and struggling to survive AND most importantly, not able to care for my parents. (Sorry If I sound dramatic, but I have this thought really often).

I'm pretty sure my parents (being tiger parents) played a role in high standards for myself, but I think after going to university and dropping out, I feel as though I am good enough or I am not smart enough. Also, everyone around me goes to the university so it's hard for me not to compare to them especially when they HAD the same goals as me and still are pursing them while I'm a ""drop-out.""  

I have thought about taking a quarter off from school to work and prepare myself for classes, but it's not an option for me right not because of parents. Though my parents are understanding people, the one they asked of me was to stay in school becuase they are worried I would be motivated to go back IF I took a break. They shocked me when they said it was okay to drop from University and I just don't want to disappoint them further. 

 Everything that happened makes me think ""Am I too dumb? ...even for community college?"" It's hard for me not to compare and not to overthink.

I'd like to stay off-campus but I highly doubt there are 1-person apartments, and if there are, they've gotta be $500+ a month.

Anyway, I've been a community college student since Fall 2017, and I'm an aerospace engineering major. I'm currently in my fourth year of what should be a two-year school, and it seems like I'm destined to get a fifth (god forbid not a sixth) year. I understand that my major with its intensive courseload just cannot be completed in two years plus gen ed, but my excuse for that ran out a long time ago. I never knew how to balance my classes (first person in my family to go to college) and ended up taking all my gen ed first. What ended up happening was that I ultimately ended up making it so that in the last two years I have never been able to take a ""full"" courseload. I've been stuck to taking two classes each semester due to scheduling, and the one time I managed to get three I got overloaded, had depressive episodes, and COVID happened. 

I consider myself a good student, I have a 3.89 GPA, am the president of my school's engineering club and do a bunch of work outside class TA'ing and tutoring to make money on the side. I work hard and generally succeed. However, over the past year I have had trouble in physics. It started when I took E\&amp;M; only one professor teaches it and his teaching style is very unique to say the least. To put it short, I cannot crack the code to succeeding in his class. I took E&amp;M with him during the aforementioned semester when COVID hit, and ended up dropping after doing mediocre on the first exam and failing the second one. All the effort I put into it went to nothing and it ended up dragging me down in my other classes - fortunately after dropping E&amp;M I was able to salvage an A in differential equations, and was one question on the final away from getting an A linear algebra but oh well. To make matters better, the next semester a new professor was teaching E\&amp;M; I retook the class and aced it without a problem, as I could better understand the new professor's teaching style.

That brings me to my problem now. That professor I struggle with, well he moved to teaching the class I'm taking now. I figured that my woes with his E&amp;M class came from my overloaded schedule, and since scheduling is an issue, I decided to take his class alongside a very easy materials science class. I figured I'd have all the time to study and succeed in his class. I studied hard for a couple weeks, understanding the concepts and I just failed the first exam. I simply cannot handle the style of his exams, and it is absolutely eating at me. I would at least like a B in the class, but I do not stand a chance in his exams, I've taken three of them and the highest I've been able to manage is a C; there are no curves and other students are somehow able to do what I merely cannot. 

I've dropped two classes before (is that a lot?), and I don't want this one class to define my academic career. Failing a class would void a transfer admission guarantee my college has with the UC system, and I would have to end up retaking the class anyway. Fortunately this professor won't be teaching the class next semester, but there's always a catch. First of all, if i were to drop the class I'd drop below the minimum unit threshold to be eligible to tutor at my school and I would have to pay back the $500 scholarship I earned for this semester. I'm willing to eat the money, but my grandparents whom I live with are beginning to get fed up with how long I'm taking to finish community college. My grandfather sees community college as a ""minor league"" for idiots and lacks understanding of how college works, but is insistent that he's right about everything despite him never attending higher education. The arguments I have with him whenever I have to drop classes/tack on another year to my timetable is traumatizing to say the least without going into anything too personal. I can understand why they are unhappy with me taking so long - I'm not happy with myself for it, but I'm only 4 classes away from graduating (including the two I'm taking this semester). 

I'm sorry if this is a tough situation to respond to, but I don't really have anyone to go to to talk about this. My grandparents are the only people in my family, and its always been my dream to attend a good school like Davis, UCSD, or UCLA (Davis is the school which my college has the admissions guarantee with, and it's the closest uni to me that offers aerospace degrees). I feel like I can easily pass the class with the next professor, who I took for mechanics. I will stick it out until the second midterm in April and see what happens, but if I fail that midterm, or barely pass, is it a better idea for me to take the ""W"" withdrawal grade and retake the class, take the financial penalty, and get scolded? Am I simply out of my league  and just let whatever happen happen? I've talked to the professor about this stuff before, and hes never told me anything helpful. I just cannot connect to his teaching style.",college,"Cannot pass the exams for a specific professor, considering withdrawal.

Was 4.0+ GPA student in high school and I have always loved school. My first year at college (Cal Poly SLO) the stress wasn't too bad. Got some B's and C's and realized my GPA wasn't as good as it used to be. My mental health declined over the course of my first year (not due to college, it was already an issue) and my grades dropped as well. I took the first quarter off this year to try and get my shit together and came back ready to start school again. Now, I was originally on track to graduate in 3 years, so I was looking at grad schools a few weeks ago to get an idea of admission criteria. Seeing these universities showing minimum 3.0 GPAs to even apply and average 3.5 GPAs for their graduate admissions made me feel like shit. My GPA is a 2.9 and I'm terrified I won't be able to get into grad school... and it's not like my GPA will likely go up much as I'm not doing much better mentally than before. I'm stressed out of my mind and I'm worried I might not be able to get into the career I want, let alone not get on academic probation this quarter with the grades I'm going to be getting.

I know being online has been really stressful for a lot of us. But I hear my friends who say they have straight A's or 3.7 GPAs and are partying every weekend. I spend around 8 hours a day on schoolwork and haven't even had time to drink or socialize. I'm planning to space out my college into the next 2ish years in order to make things easier on myself but that won't change the fact that my GPA isn't up to par. I feel so helpless and feel that I've done everything I can at this point but I still wonder what else I can do.

From anyone else who has been in a similar situation, what can I do? I can't necessarily take any more easy A classes as I've done almost all of my GE's (I have 3 left, 2 are upper division) and chemistry isn't the easiest subject. Is it worth possibly trying to put off college until I'm better (which could be years at this point... what would I even do until then?)? Is getting into grad school not as selective as they make it out to be? Am I just stressing over nothing? I'm so exhausted and I genuinely don't know how to improve my position.

I loved English in school, it was easily my favourite subject and it was my best in terms or grades by a long shot.  
My English teacher even suggested I pursue it at University with the intention of teaching or lecturing, but that's further down the line.  


I'm now seriously considering studying English as part of a joint Bachelor of Arts (where you take 2 Arts subjects to degree level).

I do read, I just don't make as much time for it as I probably should.  
There's been times where I've flown through a book or a series of books.  
I'm constantly reading in terms of articles, blog posts and Reddit posts for what little that's worth...

There's also been long stretches where I haven't even picked up a book.

I probably read more than most but I wouldn't consider myself a bookworm.  


That being said, I enjoy writing essays.  
I like really digging into topics and fleshing out essays.   
I'd really enjoy that side of the degree and I feel if reading was a key part of my degree, I'd read more and more often.

&amp;#x200B;

It may sound a little stupid, but should I pursue an English degree if I'm not a true bookworm?

I know a girl who studied English at a very prestigious school and she ultimately dropped out, she said the reading is only one part of it, it's the essay writing that's the killer.  
I'm good at that and I really enjoyed English as a school subject, specifically delving into and writing essays on novels and poetry.  
So I think I'd really excel in an English degree, but I maybe I'm wrong.

I study for a week before, reviewing notes, going over videos. It would take too long to rewrite my notes, as there are about 40 pages of notes for each class. I look at quizlets sometimes. 

The sad thing is, I sometimes have my notes up in the background and use them just to double-check myself. Almost every classmate I know uses their notes in one way or another, so I do too. How am I getting 50s literally using what the professor taught us? Today, I felt so confident with my a&amp;p exam and got a 50. I just don't get it.

I have never done an internship, but I have worked for quite a bit. I have never once in 16 job interviews been asked if I have a degree.

I got him again since he’s the only professor teaching this class.

His teaching methods involve not teaching certain subjects because we need to figure it out on our own... during exams.... because that’s how it works in the real world.

For example, he made a pre-recorded lecture of chapter 1 and explained formulas and methods to solve problems. Homework was pretty much what was on the lectures as expected.

Exam 1 came by and 1 out of the 5 questions were from the lectures. The rest we needed to figure it out on our own. There’s no study guide. I’m sure there are other Professor like this but personally it fina it very hard to learn on my own, that’s why I’m going to school so a professor can teach me not so I can pay thousands of dollars just so they can tell me to read a book.

But besides the point, this semester he mentioned he’s a full time professor at a different college and will be focusing on that school. So this means if we email him to the email my school gave him, he will check it once in a while... He clearly already said he has no real interest in our school. He’s just helping my school since I guess there was no one else to teach the class.

He’s a very hard professor to understand. Just like me, I suck at explaining things but the problem is that he’s a professor, I’m not. His job is only to explain. But whatever, I’m getting by with external videos and tutorials.

Well not for my next issue, he won’t answer my disability accommodation form. It explicitly states he needs to email me back saying he got the form and read it. But it’s been 10 days now and no response. I email him again and still no answer. 

This guy clearly doesn’t care about us, anything I can do? We never got out Professor rating forms last semester so I couldn’t complain. Is there a way I can anonymously complain to the school? 

Oh I also forgot to mention, I emailed him a few times last semester both through canvas and email asking for help but he doesn’t answer. He expects us to use the Q&amp;A module on canvas and wait for other students to answer our question. He won’t do it. And students won’t answer the questions either so like? What am I suppose to do?

581,ZenithCrests,1612190198,/r/college/comments/la4f3b/am_i_going_to_die_early_with_the_amount_of_all/,"Last summer, I pulled around 24 all nighters within the summer in order to pull off finishing a 1200 page (wrote about 600 pages of notes), 100 lab course.

This Fall, I pulled at least 3 all nighters per week. Round 800 questions per course, with around 200 animations to watch in order to get full credit. Wrote around 500 pages of notes per course (there were three courses. One of which I failed and the other I dropped due to the homework load being waaaaaay too much to handle). I had 4 courses.

This current winter, 2 or so per week because of a lighter load. Still using a terrible online program that does the 800 question, 500 pages of notes thing, so that takes up most of the time. Scripting Languages.

I'm nearly 27. And in the last year alone, I've pulled off enough all nighters to be equivalent to 3 full months. Needless to say, I really, ***really*** **hate** online college.

\[edit:  I'm updating here to give further information. Needless to say, I was very tired last night due to one of the recent all nighters so I was pretty lazy with my explanation. Sorry about that.

I was learning scripting languages in Python coding language (still am due to failing it last term). It's like learning a new language all over again, as the language the school started me off on was JavaScript, wherein the some of the coding rules are done in the exact opposite order of Python, so it's still difficult to get out of that habit. The school has pretty much forced the equivalent of a 6 month course into a 3 month period, and so taking 3 courses is like taking six at once.

I was taking Java for a while too, which is also another coding language. Databases uses SQL which is a different type of language. So I was learning that too. Then there's Server Management, which again, uses another type of language called a command line (or something like that), within powershell. So that's four languages at once. Three of the courses are required now, but at that time, all four were. Thankfully when I dropped Java, it was no longer needed.

However, I did write that many notes. And I did start to lose count of how many times I spent doing all nighters in the summer. I do know that it was at least 3 or so days per week however. A lot of the online courses seem to be packed full of text, information, quizzes and labs that easily overwhelm a person. And the tests are the reasons for the notes. After bombing the first few online tests due to how information heavy they were I just started adding as many notes as possible. It's not like I'm new to taking notes. I've been doing it for 6-7 years as I'm a bit of academic and pretty much plan to work within it once I attain a high enough degree. I've never taken online courses before this year though. And it seems that tests generated or created online are far harder than they are whenever classes are done in the physical classroom.

As for writing that much, I write all the time. Whether it be out of fun or book/research writing, as my passion has nothing to do with computer stuff. That's just a back up for a job in the future. My passion, history and education, are far more word-heavy, but still easier to navigate than anything dealing with computers, in my opinion. I've already published a thesis, so writing for me has never been the **worst** thing I could do. Anyway, I can write 60 - 70 wpm so it's never been a problem to fill a page on a digital page or even physical page. Can do so in about five minutes.

But yeah, the reason why I write so many damn notes, in short, is because the tests are so fickle at times that they could ask you a keyword or vital piece of jargon one second, and then the next be asking you what line the 236th period is on. In other words, there are a lot of questions with seemingly unimportant background information is asked. Thus I pretty much record *everything*. Makes the open book tests a hell of a lot easier. Just Ctrl + F and search through the mass of notes for the keyword or noun within the question and bobs your uncle.

But yeah, I'm talking to one of my teachers/advisors about it who feels as if some of the online services we use are inadequate, and that others should be served in its place. I mean, its great and all about the wealth of information stored in some of these places, but sometimes having *too much* information can overwhelm the student, especially if there's more than one strenuous course to take.\]",college,Am I going to die early with the amount of all nighters I pull?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/la4f3b/am_i_going_to_die_early_with_the_amount_of_all/,1612208198.0

586,b3_w4ter,1611332916,/r/college/comments/l2r77v/what_are_some_good_high_acceptancerate_schools/,"Hi guys,

I'm a terrible student but learn extremely quickly. I attended one semester of college in the USA after a terrible high school career. I was only accepted due to my father working at the school and the school having a high acceptance-rate. I was in the gifted program as a kid and have academic potential, but am a huge ADHD underperformer and tend to get into trouble at school, fights, etc. After getting kicked out/dropping out of school in the US, I moved to Germany to study Business Psych after learning German fluently in one year. I didn't like the business classes and I got offered a job in translation and rarely went to class or studied, instead, I spent most of my time boxing, playing video games, translating, and then dropped out before corona after coming back for vacation last year. When I would go to class it would be on 4 hours of sleep because I'd go ride my bike 10 KM to the boxing school at night, box 2-3 hours, ride my bike back in the freezing dark, get home adrenaline pumping, make food, then have to get up at 5-6 AM to shower, dress, eat, and catch the bus.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also had some persistent medical issues as a result of a skiing accident when I was 16. Multiple corrective surgeries, further injuries suffered during recovery, etc, have further sidetracked my academic career.  I also hate school but love learning (particularly language/psych) and have a real talent for languages, as told to me by multiple teachers, German, French, Latin, etc. I just pick it up very quickly and love to play around with words.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going in for two more surgeries as a result of my old accident next month and it's caused me to rethink my life after raging against the academic system for a year since my last drop out and multiple tirades about how I don't need any education to make it, etc. Outside of translation from home, I've been working unfulfilling manual labor jobs with absolutely retarded coworkers, who treat a 10$/hr job like a machiavellian war, and I've been barely making by. I want to go back to school, get a BSC Psych degree, and expand my knowledge of languages, particularly Russian and French. It's hard to find schools that offer such languages that aren't top-notch institutions, which a 2-time college drop-out with terrible high school grades would be able to get into.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also considered joining the navy or coast guard, but it'll likely be a while until I'm ""cleared"" to do so after these next set of surgeries and my conduct record would be of some difficulty. I've even considered joining the merchant marines and going to a merchant marine college to become a ship captain, I've been sailing and driving boats since childhood, but I'd rather do both of those after studying my interests and expanding myself a bit academically and seeing where that leads me.",college,What are some good HIGH ACCEPTANCE-RATE schools for studying foreign language and psych?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/l2r77v/what_are_some_good_high_acceptancerate_schools/,1611350916.0

Nor has she communicated with us. Earlier last week I emailed her before class started confirming she is teaching the course on blackboard. Nothing late last week I email her again. Nothing. If you look at my Eng 101 class you can see the last time it was updated was a month ago with a course announcement. I cant access my class work as nothing is posted not even a syllabus. I'm worried that when she posts we will all be behind there for set to fail. I have done everything I can to make sure my computer is update and that this isnt an issue on my end. The head professor is involved and will now be inolving the dean. The second issue is my original med term professor dropped the class.

I  am leeching off my parents as of now and its my junior year in  University and I am currently 19. I tried doing architecture but I  didn't like it so I dropped it. I talked to my counselor and said my  best option to graduate on time is continue with the Chinese classes  I've been taking. I was told I cannot join ROTC as a junior because I  needed 4 years JROTC experience from high school, but if I wanted to  join ROTC I would graduate in 3 years instead of 1.

Either A:

I  graduate next year with a Bachelors in Critical Languages and  International Studies with a Minor in Chinese. AND HOPE SOMEONE CAN  EMPLOY ME WITH (IMO A USELESS DEGREE) NO ROTC PROGRAM

OR B:

Graduate  with the same degree in 3 years EXCEPT it would be under ROTC so I can  become an officer in the Army under the ROTC program. AND HOPEFULLY BE  SET ON LIFE WITH A JOB IN THE ARMY PAID AS AN OFFICER

The  only reason I choose the Chinese degree is because it is the fastest  route to get out of college within next year. Any other course would  take a year or two longer. If I go with the 3 years I can hope I get a  GI Bill or stipend from ROTC because I've almost ran out of FAFSA funding. WWYD?

I really don’t fit in here, I am a tall, fairly decent looking (ex-model) brunette who is more introverted and academically motivated. I would much rather play a board game or have a wine night in with the girls than go to a gross frat party.

Sorry if this sounds so judgy, but I feel like most kids don’t have a brain. I am often at the top of my class and want to go places in life.

I'm planning to go to college soon, one that's decent sized but in a small town. I'm in my last year of high school, and my stepdad has been constantly reminding me of it.

I've been applying for scholarships, but I've been worried about my GPA and if I'll even get money for college. My total GPA is 3.0 right now, but I'm not even sure if that's what they'll be looking at. I'm in a middle class family, and someone else is currently paying for our house (it's in a upper class neighborhood, but I'm not related to these people)

My stepdad never graduated college, and he dropped out for work. He's been obsessed with me starting to work *right after high-school*, and then continuing work in college as well. I've expressed that I don't want that stress on myself just yet and would rather wait for my first year to be over before tackling a part time job.

I have yet to get a car or a license and I've expressed that to him as well, and it seems like he wants it his way and only his way. It makes me completely stressed because he's not taking no for an answer. My mom is completely okay with my plan (to get my license this summer, start school this fall and start working after my first year. She's also okay with me taking breaks) but my stepdad isn't.

Ever since we've talked about this, I've been completely stressed out. I've always done my best in high school (I've never failed a class and have always gotten mostly As, Bs and a C or two. Not perfect but I've tried) but I'm afraid that my best isn't good enough. 

I'm not sure how I should approach everything basically,, I was hoping this subreddit could help me out since this one is specifically for college.

Anything helps. Thanks!",college,I'm going to be an incoming freshmen and I'm a little worried about school.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ku1ij3/im_going_to_be_an_incoming_freshmen_and_im_a/,1610250877.0

Biggest regret of my life. After way too many years, I finally decided to get my diploma, and I just graduated last year, but there's a couple of problems....

1) Even though I technically graduated, I learned almost nothing due to the fact that I was basically just copying glossaries from text books. That was literally it.

2) On top of having not learned anything, my high school, for whatever reason, gave me a 3.81 GPA. So now my transcript ( for the most part) is very inaccurate.

3) I want to go to college, but I don't know very much about how college even work, aside from surface level knowledge. So I don't even know where to begin readjusting myself into a educational environment after 12 years of not being in school....

It just all seems so hopeless. I want so bad to get myself back on track, and will do whatever it takes.

I find that I mostly want to work in a career that has a more a  humanitarian mission and is people focused which has led me to explore trying to use my degree to transition to something in health care and/or education but I feel like this is a mistake to explore this late in college. Currently i was taking an internal combustion and Energy systems class for my major and I really don't like it so much so I dropped for a bio class since I'm not graduating this year anyway and have the time. Plus I really enjoyed taking a physiology class last quarter as an elective. at the same time I feel like I shouldn't be doing things like this and should just finish my degree asap.

 I had an idea for a while to go to school for biomedical engineering and/or occupational therapy for a master's since I like being in stem but I also want to have a more humanitarian approach to my degree.

601,hsarah01,1610078201,/r/college/comments/ksuk6n/feeling_down_about_returning_to_school/,"Hi all! School restarts next week and I've just been experiencing waves of anxiety and sadness thinking about it. Last quarter was so hard for me academically, I did well but I was studying all the time and took little to no breaks and thinking about returning to that level of commitment is really psyching me out (I already dropped a ""for fun"" class I was planning on taking since originally my course load was heavier than it was last quarter). On top of that, I get to go back to campus this quarter but we're moving in two weeks after the quarter starts to wait for cases to die down, and I'm just really stressing out about leaving home/moving in the middle of classes. 

I never was somebody who struggled with homesickness or leaving my family (I go to school across the country), but for some reason I'm getting really stressed thinking about leaving home this time, and you would think it would be the opposite given I've been home for eight months now. I lost my grandma and dog this summer, and my grandma lived with us and played a big role in raising me. My grandpa passed in March as well. I started hanging out on my parents' couch to do my schoolwork and it was really comforting for me to spend time with them. I never really interacted with them like that in high school, which I guess is why it feels different this time.

 I'm worried about not being able to have that same emotional support when I go back to school -- I love my friends but most of them aren't in classes as academically rigorous as mine so if I won't have as much time to hang out with them; even when they study, they usually mess around and stuff, it's hard to stay focused and get work done. But then the thought of just being holed up in my room all quarter without the (albeit quiet) support I got at home makes me really sad. 

I have the option of staying home but then I know I'm really going to regret not going back, because I'm probably coming back home for the spring also (quarter system). I'm trying to review my chem notes from last semester to prep for class and I can't focus. I don't really know what to do or what the point of this post is but I'm feeling sad and unmotivated and I need to kick this before Monday. :/",college,Feeling down about returning to school.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ksuk6n/feeling_down_about_returning_to_school/,1610096201.0

Maybe it will help someone else. I’ve always struggled in school since about 6th grade. In my sophomore year of highschool I realized I would fail out of highschool if I didn’t do homeschooling, so I did that and barely finished. I tried to enroll in college and did but quickly realized I wouldn’t be able to make it and dropped out. I went through a couple tries of online school one or two classes at a time and then dropped out again. 2 years after that I enrolled again thinking I was older and smarter and as a surprise to no one, couldn’t hack it. I got permanently kicked out of that college for failing too many classes. I thought maybe if I went to college in person that might help, so I enrolled in a local college, and once again failed 3 classes out of 4. That time was a bit different as it was just last spring, I was so lucky that the college didn’t hold it against me and allowed me to enroll in the fall semester. I had been diagnosed with adhd a year prior but had never really figured out my meds, so over the summer I decided to really buckle down and figure that out, I got to a great place with my adhd and anxiety, I met with an advisor who helped me find a degree program I had many natural strengths in and set up a semester plan for success, I got a tutor, met with my advisor every month and took out some loans so I could afford to only work part time and make school my main priority. It paid off, I finished up the fall semester with a 4.0 and am heading into this next one with even better studying skills. I’m 23 and by the time I graduate I’ll be turning 27. It feels a bit strange to be so much older than my fellow students but I’ve learned to just not care so much. If I could go back to 18 year old me who was so sure she was far to stupid to ever go to college I would give myself the biggest hug. If you’re reading this and you’re struggling please know you aren’t stupid and you can make it happen. Everyone’s journey looks different, find the help you need and what works for you and do it.

For context, I have been struggling with Borderline Personality disorder, depression, anxiety and social anxiety since I was 14. I used to write suicide notes in class and cry in the bathrooms. The signs were there when I was a kid, but it wasn't taken too seriously until I had thoughts of ending my life. 

When I got through high school, I was a prodigy. 6 A's and 1 B. I had won a trip to France with my writing in the 11th grade. I finally made it as one of the top academics. I was...content. 

Then university happened. 

I couldn't socialise with people because I didn't know how to make friends and the thought of talking to a stranger was like swallowing glass. I struggled in my classes because of the increased workload and different style of teaching. Other contributing factors in my personal life brought me down. 

I passed that year, somehow making it into the Golden Key society, which meant I was in the top 15% of learners for my degree. But I was utterly fucking miserable. My parents insisted that I go back. 

Second year was when things intensified even more. I was trying to come to terms with my sexuality and gender. My personal life was an absolute mess with an abusive ex still in my life. I was struggling to concentrate and put my all into assignments. I attempted suicide in the bathroom on campus and then again in a lecture. I was forced to drop out. 

Again, my parents told me to go back. 

This time would be different right? I was doing a degree that aligned with my dreams(I'm a wannabe writer and I finally got to do an English degree in my third year, the first two years was a business degree). It would change. This would be my turning point right? 

Wrong. 

This was the worst year of my life. I had panic attacks that rendered me motionless. I couldn't find motivation to do anything. Suicide was on my mind every single hour. I couldn't make any friends. Therapy(my fifth year in therapy by the way) became ineffective(I believe I'm untreatable). My dysphoria was at an all time high. 

On the day of an assignment, I sent my lecturer a letter saying that I just couldn't function anymore. I did not see into the second semester. Once again, I dropped out and, recently, went to a mental health clinic for the second time in my life. 

Now my parents are saying I need to go back, because a degree is what matters in this world. I know they're right. I know they are. But I know two things. A) My dreams (youtube, streaming, voice acting, writing, a lot of creative stuff) don't align with university and the structure of how things are taught there, which made me disillusioned and B) University was one of the main reasons why I was self destructing. 

I know that people are meant to tolerate things that they don't like. Maybe I'm just weak. Maybe I'm not meant for this harsh world, but I can't do it anymore. I can't go to university anymore because I know it will kill me. But my parents insist.

If you have any advice for me and how I can navigate a conversation with my parents, please please tell me. I'm desperate here. Registration open on the 25th and they'll be checking that I do it. I know they will. I don't know what to do. Honestly. 

I hope everybody is doing much better than I am and that your New Year has been okay. I have a hard decision to make. Maybe it's not hard. Maybe my parents are just completely right and I'm wrong.

Dear Committee on Scholastic Standards Members,

I am writing to appeal my academic dismissal from Colorado State University as of the end of the Fall 2020 Semester. I know that I have fallen well below the required cumulative 2.0 GPA multiple times now during my probationary period, however I hope that I am considered strongly for readmission. My Fall 2019 term GPA was 1.272, my Spring 2020 term GPA was 1.769, and my Fall 2020 term GPA a straight 0.000. My cumulative GPA is currently 0.937. I have faced multiple hardships during my three terms at CSU, which have caused great mental health problems which in turn affected my academic commitments. However, I am deeply committed to returning to CSU and being a successful student.

During my Fall 2019 term, I was faced with the prospect of a college education and was excited and willing to dive in, until one of my very close friends passed away due to an accident. This did not help me cement any solid foundation for the coming semesters, as it snowballed into more problems. I attempted to correct my academic failings by meeting with professors and my advisor, but I was unable to cope with my mental health issues, grief, and the stress of school. During my Spring 2020 term, I was motivated to turn my academic career around, but I was dealt with multiple unexpected problems. CSU moved to full online learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a major disruption in my life, from moving home, my schedule and routine being uprooted, and my focus and motivation to work on my academics dropped completely. My grandmother, who I was very close with, also passed away during April, after the switch to online learning. This, combined with the stresses of virtual education, COVID-19 hitting my community very hard, took a downward spiral and accelerated it. I knew I had faced two very challenging first semesters at CSU, and was motivated to really, really, turn my GPA around and get on the track I strived to be in when I arrived. However, with the COVID-19 restrictions, I was socially removed, isolated, and that started to create a mindset of staying in and being safe. I didn’t leave my room, and thought I’d be able to do classwork 100% virtually, which was not the case. It caused me to shut down, make poor academic decisions, and become discouraged in myself. After multiple visits with a CSU Health Network counselor, I was told I was exhibiting many signs of anxiety and depression but did not receive an actual diagnosis. My inability to turn this Fall 2020 semester around is entirely my fault, as I thought I could prove to myself that I’d be able to turn my situation around, however that was not the case. 

	Over the winter break, I have taken the time to mentally decompress and process the past year of my life. This has taken a lot of work on my part, but I have been able to set myself up with a better mindset and the skills and strategies to excel academically. If my appeal is accepted, I will be utilizing many strategies to do well academically. I will be taking less credit hours than I have in the past, to give me more time to work on each individual class and take time for my mental health. I will be meeting weekly or bi-weekly with my Academic Advisor to help me keep track of my progress and keep me motivated. I also will be meeting with a Student Success Coordinator on a weekly basis to strategize with me and help me to keep organized. I also will be using all of my professor’s office hours more during the semester to not only ask questions and get clarification, but to assure them I am keeping up with my work and progressing throughout each course. I also plan to use the TILT Center to get help, and will utilize its resources as much as possible. I also will be using the CSU Health Network at a more frequent rate to help keep my mental health in check and to gain more resources on dealing with those internal problems. I will be frequent about my check-ins with faculty and staff, and will commit myself to excellence to them and the University as a whole. I will become more proactive in relation to my academic standings in all courses, and will reach out before any problems I am having compile more than they already did. I know that I can no longer afford to be lazy, discouraged, or into a dark spot mentally, as I know I can get help often, and that the only person here who is affected by my academic performance is myself. I look forward to returning if my appeal is accepted, and this dismissal has given me the incentive to work hard and correct my wrongs and do right by myself, but also my professors, advisor, classmates, and CSU as a whole. 

I humbly thank you for the opportunity to attend CSU and to appeal this dismissal, and I sincerely hope that you consider my appeal. 

Sincerely,

I study in a CEGEP (Quebec college) in Montreal and I can say that all I have done in college is struggle and catch up. I am in Honours Science and I have done 3 semesters + a summer semester. But they all were just hard on me and my mental health. 

The first semester, it occurred that my high school did not teach us some pre-Calculus topics that were expected from a college student and I had to spend 2 months catching up which went on to ruin all my other courses and leave me in a mess where I was averaging 4 hours of sleep each night for the last 2 months of the semester. Bear in mind that we didn't have a fall break that semester and we went ham for 15 weeks straight. I even dropped a course in that semester because it was too much. **R-score that semester was 34.25**

Second semester, I was finally getting myself together until I messed up in one Physics 103 test and starting burning out. Eventually, COVID-19 changed that semester since no grades were counted to our R-score (Quebec's grading method to assess student's performance). **R-score that semester was 34.25**

I did a summer semester to catch up with the 2-year-plan of finishing college but I ended up tanking French big time (my French skills are non-existent since I never was able to learn it as an immigrant). And because of French, my R-score took a hit by about 2 whole points. **R-score was 32.95**

And now I just finished my 3rd semester and this was the toughest one. Every hardwork hardly payed off. I struggled all semester with Physics 102, I only got 80s in General Biology 1 and fell 5 points below class avg. And my Linear Algebra course was just horrid because we had to self-learn everything since we had a teacher incapable in teaching anything. I burned out very early when I saw that my hardwork was no longer paying off. **My R-score for this semester has not been released.**

And here I am, thinking what the hell am I going to do. I am constantly anxious about my result because that will decide what I can go for in university. I want to be a Robotics Engineer and for that I want an admission to Computer Science. But I fear that I will not make it and might just be jeopardy.

Sorry for the extra long post! I am from Europe, but English is not my first language.


 I believe that my college (I am a med student, dunno if that is necessary to mention) has some toxic people studying there and make the studying experience unpleasant. I will use one of my experience as an example...sorry if it is dumb..I think the situation is quite childish. I hoped i didn't have to deal with such things when I am over 20 years old.


In my case the two people who used to be my friends started talking shit about me for no reason behind my back. It happened when they were hired instead of me because of nepotism. I got told off pretty badly by the hospital staff and also insulted by them when I asked why they did not hire me as they promised ...I got a job at a better and much bigger hospital fortunately later and forgot about the situation as I had other things to deal with.


I later found out that the hospital staff and those two college ""friends"" told everyone that I was a psychopath and banged doors and yelled in the hospital since I did not get what I want and etc not gonna go into details but it was nasty. They somehow pretended to be victimis even tho I was the one that had a bad experience. I never even said anything bad about them, just went on with my life. 


Since in the beginning I thought that they were my friends, I told one of them what happened..did not stop them from acting that way. They also tried to get as much information as they can about me from others and lied when I called out them on their bullshit. I ended the  ""friendship"" we had since they were never sincere and did not even try to apologize.


Ans then one of my last remaining close friends in med school then pretended to be my friend..was siding with me and as she herself said the others' behaviour disgusted her. Well it lasted for a year and then backstabbed me and accused me for her saying bad things about her precious friends (the ones who talked shit about me) and turning her against them; also said that I was trying to make her to become me and that I am a horrible person to be ...that hurt me, since I just don't get it where those lies came from??


 I never even said anything, never manipulated anyone to be like me or forced my opinions on anyone.., was even happy that the others who did not treat me nicely did well but did not want to talk to them for obvious reasons. I only disliked their behaviour towards me and I did not change my mind about that. Other than that I still was normal with them when they were in trouble or when one of them asked me something regarding college.


I guess the last remaining college friend wanted to get more info about me, my new job, my plans for future and my notes and help...or wanted to have the other two as better friends since they grew apart and I on other hand was a closer friend. 



I find myself not enjoying studying and going to college as much. My grades have dropped this year too. I feel alone in med school, since we are studying in small groups ..and other studens are kinda competitive too..I cannot really do teamwork with the people who treated me poorly because they ignore me, even when I am doing good job regarding the assignment or have good ideas. Or they make me do the difficult parts and bring me down if they don't understand the material (I am quite an average student, not trying to sound like I am ideal and smart).

Back then I was still depressed and very stressed due to working in corrections at night and going to school in the mornings. I just couldn’t and I dropped out before failing the classes.

I decided to return to school after getting my appeal approved and being paced on probation this last August, got an 89% in precalculus, 75% in trigonometry and a 69% in Chemistry. I’m a Chemistry major! I already feel like shit for flunking my first major class. But then I receive an email, right after Christmas break just started so I can’t even speak to any staff member until January and now I have to deal with these thoughts until then. I spoke to my advisor a couple weeks ago because I knew I ran the risk of failing my Chemistry class and he said I should have been good with my financial aid even if I got a D on my Chemistry class because of the performance structure. So now I feel cheated, lied to, and stupid.

I was struggling with these classes because the college decided to change all the courses to 8 weeks, and in my opinion that was too much material at once. At least for the Chemistry class, I was fine with the other classes. The material wasn’t even that difficult, I just needed more time to process it.

My dream was a very simple and achievable dream, I wanted at least a bachelors in Chemistry. Any other degree seems uninteresting to me. There isn’t anything else I wanted to do except Chemistry. 

I have been hurt by so many people who have been scholars and it feels like a stab in the chest knowing that all the people who have tried to put me down would be so happy of my failure. What is the purpose of me waking up every day knowing that I’m not good enough for myself? I can’t even tell anyone of what is going on because I have so many people giving me their support and I don’t want to put them down. I just want to Earth to swallow me.

Hey so I lost the generic lottery pretty hard lol I dropped out of high school senior year and recently earned my diploma. I’ve been working awful retail and food service jobs since 15 ( I haven’t been unemployed for more than a week or so since that age) that have always been mentally draining but i’ve hit what feels like the breaking point with it. I can’t get through shifts anymore without feeling like breaking down or thinking about how much of a fuck up I am compared to every one of my friends being enrolled in big time universities in my state. 

I hate where I live and I hope to maybe be able to live in a large city someday which is very far fetched for someone like me. To do that I obviously need to go to college or learn a trade. Majority of people I know think me attempting to go to community college is an awful idea due to my previous academic history and general lack of intelligence, i’ll just find myself in more debt. 

Trades I have no passion or interest in at all but most close to me believe that’s my one chance at escaping low pay retail work. 

I’m 16k in debt from an impulsive car purchase and I currently make 12.60 an hour working 40 a week with 4k in my account. Luckily I live at home and have little no bills outside of that.

I work hard, I really do. I bust ass at every job i’ve had, I never call in and I never complain or make myself a hassle to employ. I go to the bathroom and have mini mental meltdowns and go right on forcing myself through the shift 5 minutes after. The issue is, i’m just not smart. I am not a smart human being and i’m not capable of mentally handling much info at all and I find myself fucking up quite often in my low level retail jobs despite that effort. 

I’ve always been called retarded and slow and hopeless and all that and I don’t know what to do. I want to go to college but I can’t compete with the type of people who can handle that stuff, i’m not on the same level intellectually. Is there any degrees that require less math that you think someone with below average mental capabilities could handle?

I wont list my passions or interests, people who aren’t borderline retarded can afford to pursue that lol I just want to be able to make enough money doing whatever I have too to get out of here",college,"Turning 20 tomorrow, former high school drop out with learning disabilities and bad mental health tendencies.

I then found I was pregnant the first week of school so I withdrew because I had to move and being a first time mom and having major depression and undiagnosed ADHD at the time I had no clue what I was doing. 

I moved back a couple years later. Had another daughter.  Got diagnosed with ADHD and started medication for that and my depression. Now I finally had the courage to go back to college this year. Started in the fall. Then got sick for 6 weeks and had to be querintined and did 2 covid tests.  One of the professors told me at the end of my querintine for the first test (10) days I could make up a test i missed.  I was fine with that.  Then 3 days later when my test came back negative she emailed me around 11am saying since my covid test was negative and she just got the email that I needed to come in and do the test before 3pm. I emailed her back saying i have another class until 2 (zoom) that day and had to get my daughter from school after but told her I could take the test literally any other day that week. She never emailed me back and gave me 0s on the test and the assignment I turned in! So I withdrew because it was only the 2nd/3rd week of the semester. I finished my other 3 classes for the semester getting a 3.6 GPA.

I got an email today that said im on financial aid suspension. I guess they take into account all the withdrawals from 2014 also? I had no idea.  Was never told any of this. I sent the appeal today but I am so upset. I worked so hard my first full semester in school.  I got 2 As and 1 B that was so close to being an A but when I did end up getting covid it hit me hard and I failed an a couple assignments for the class I got a B in. I feel like my appeal will be denied because I mean it's 2020 right? I did say in my appeal that I got pregnant when I dropped out the first time and I also had undiagnosed adhd and had depression.

626,Mr_Two_Bits,1608011740,/r/college/comments/kdg0uc/how_i_failedwithdraw_5_semesters_in_a_row_and/,"I don't hear a lot of stories about failing nearly two years' worth of college and somehow making it back. So here's my story.

I suffer from severe depression. I barely graduated from high school but the extra credits of my AP classes pushed me over. I only applied to one college and I somehow got in 2015. I thought I was doing alright for around two years into college. I got some internships as a sophomore, got into clubs, and did the whole computer science grind life.

But my issues were never actually solved. With depression, people frequently get episodes. They do fine for a bit and then they regress heavily back to a bad place. For the next 2 years, I was in a cycle of almost killing myself, then taking a break, going back to classes, and then falling apart again. I would go to a therapist, take different medications, and nothing would change. At some point, I didn't believe I could change. Ironically, thinking so make it impossible to change.

The scariest part of depression is losing all passion for everything I used to love. For the entire time, I never changed my major from CS because I knew that's what I wanted to do. But when I fell into depression, I just lost all interest in doing anything. I didn't read about CS anymore and just coasted in my apartment watching the world and my friends move on.

I watched people who entered college after I get internships at Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. I saw my friends building careers at these companies. I remember going to the library seeing my friend study and just hanging out. Now I don't recognize anyone in the clubs or the library. I broke down in tears at the library realizing all the time I wasted and all the friends I can't see anymore. With covid, it upended everything and now no one can go to the library.

But the course for me changed. At the beginning of last year, I started to take meditation more seriously. I figured that if nothing could help me, maybe doing this would help. At the start, it didn't do anything. But as I got better at meditation, I realized that its true power lies in examining and reflecting on the thoughts that happen in my head. I had CBT done with me but wasn't helpful since I wasn't taking in the lessons. However, meditation was like taking a microscope to these thoughts and critically examining their sources and their effects. The dark cloud that robbed me of my happiness wasn't random or impenetrable. That mood was fueled by ""clinging."" (This is a Buddhist term). If I just let go of these thoughts, often they don't come back.

This process didn't lift me out of depression entirely. Meditation and reflection were more like cleaning a dirty lens so I can see more clearly. The lens of my mind gets dirty very often and frequently, so I just clean it repeatedly. Often I forget to do so and start to slide into a depression again but I catch myself and reel back from those thoughts. Meditation allowed me to handle the pressure of classes and submit assignments as opposed to withdrawing. I still struggle greatly with time management, anxiety, and feeling tired all the time but I am crawling as opposed to collapsing. 

I lost all of my financial aid since my grades tanked. I know that the only reason why I didn't drop out of college is that my parents were willing to pay for the tuition and fees. I couldn't have gotten here if I just dropped out of college.

I’m the outlier of everyone around me. I hardly graduated HS and had a 2.2 GPA. I was terribly abused by roommates and my ex gf in college, had a roommate bring her abusive husband around make me terrified to even be there nearly got evicted numerous times, had my first roommate cause me to become suicidal and everything else and she caused my parents to nearly foreclose on their first home (that they had just bought months prior to this in their fifties. The girls mom then continued to treat us horrifically when we took care of her daughter while she was in the hospital etc after a suicide attempt). I lived in my grandparents three bedroom condo with 8 people because my whole family had to move in with my grandparents. I had severe depression in Hs and anxiety. 

Last year I tried to Off myself because my ex drug me through his addictions lying and cheating and I ruined my collegiate career because of it. I sacrificed jobs relationships and my own sanity and happiness for him. I resorted to sex work for the last four years. I only quit this year. And I am also dealing from the consequences of that on my social life personal life and mental state. I also went to jail because my brother beat me and cops don’t really give a shit about women who are abused. I took many semesters off or took very minimal classes because I paid out of pocket from SW. I’m only saying this because while I get it’s hard I don’t get why I should censor myself for being happy. I think I deserve to be happy about something going right in my life for once.

I also passed up a chance to go to a Yale bussiness camp fully paid for. As a senior, my depression got worse and dropped to 54 out of 300 when I graduated.

Due to some stuff that happened I ended failing a class twice, got depressed about it and dropped out(4 year college). Years later in 2016 I restarted on a different college, due to me having a below average gpa on my first college(started on a community college). After getting my associates around winter 2018, I didnt go to college since I was moving in with my gf(expenses and stuff). Got separated on the beginning of 2020, and restarted going to college to the old university where my gpa is below 2.0 (was 1.2 ), its around 1.8 or so currently.

So i took two classes and my teacher didn't release the grades for the test until today, so im failing hard with almost no possible way to pass one of my classes. The other one ill probably get a B or A, the other one a F or D at the best possible scenario. Which will bring my gpa even lower, on my community college I got a gpa of 3.0. I know that is worthless on another institution, since they have their own gpa. 

So my question is this I get no financial aid due to my gpa, I have already applied for two appeals but they haven't approved them. I pay out of pocket and due to the fact that I will not get financial aid next semester due to my failing grade it will slow my degree completion. I have scheduled a meeting with my counselors to see what is my best option. Cant restart since I used some credits for my Associates, cant drop the classes since it has been 7 years plus.

Basically, my early academic history was pretty much in line with the high achiever archetype. When secondary school time came around, i got into a good prep school (phillips academy) but ended up at a different school due to some bizarre family stuff. I tried but only the minimum to do well. Got a \~3.9 the first year uw, then switched to public again due to some personal stuff. At this point i felt depressed and maybe i felt prey to some sort of character flaw??

I'm a third year epidemiology major at my college and recently I've begun to have some doubts on if this is truly something I can see myself doing as a career in the future. My freshman year I was at a different university in Minnesota studying biomedical engineering. After being super daunted by the intro physics course, I dropped the class and changed my major to chemistry with no real reason other than it was a science degree that didn't need the physics class. I soon realized that I only switched as it was an easy way out of taking a hard class, and I needed to find something I actually enjoyed. Later that year, the university president at the time announced tuition increases for out-of-state students and that drove me to look into transferring to a more affordable school. At the same time, I had been looking at careers that make a lot of money that are relatively interesting to me. This is when I found epidemiology and transferred to my current school to study it, as well as to get my lackluster GPA reset to 4.0 during the transfer. Sophomore year was good, I was liking my classes and managed to keep my 4.0 first semester and have a 3.8 the next. But now, I've got 3 C's and 2 B's, largely because I am just not passionate about any of the classes that I'm taking. 

After long days of reflection and conversations with my girlfriend, I'm slowly starting to realize that I still have tons of passion in engineering and that every time I think about it I get excited, and I've come to the conclusion that I should probably resume studying it at some point in time. The problem is that I only have one year left in my degree and I know that switching to engineering again would probably add 2 and a half years to my graduation time. My girlfriend says I should just get my epidemiology degree over with so I have something of weight and then go back to school, but I think that given how little motivation I have towards these classes that it'll be really tough to do so.

642,anonbutterflyrocks,1606328428,/r/college/comments/k0xkv8/how_i_won_an_academic_violation_case_and_how_you/,"**If you want to read the story that began this, I made this post in October:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jcuhw7/professor\_said\_i\_hacked\_into\_his\_computer\_to\_get/](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jcuhw7/professor_said_i_hacked_into_his_computer_to_get/)

Hey everyone. I come bearing good news. I ended up winning an academic dishonesty case against my professor, who claimed that I cheated on an Zoom administered exam because I answered a single question with an something that he didn't teach in class. He claimed I searched up my answer because he saw something similar online. This all started in October, when my professor held a meeting with me and tried getting me to confess to something I did not do: cheat. He then proceeded to report me to the college even after I explained my side of things to him and told him numerous times I didn't cheat and that he's making a mistake.

For all of October and most of November, I was utterly depressed. All of my hair fell out and I lost like 10 pounds, for real. Waking up every day felt horrible. I felt like I had a huge weight on my chest and I wouldn't be able to get it off, ever. I couldn't focus on anything this semester, friends, family, even my other classes. I couldn't even leave my room and talk to my parents, and whenever I did, I would cry because I wished something like this would've happened to me in high school or something, not college, because they would've been able to defend me. But in college, you're pretty much all alone. Parents can't do much but show you sympathy and reassure you. What will be the outcome? What will happen to me? Will I get kicked out of college? These would be the only things I would think about 24/7.

I'm a pre-med student and a cheating accusation could derail my entire track to medical school, my lifelong dream. I thought my life was over. Yeah, I know this sounds dramatic, but it really isn't dramatic when you're living through it. On top of that, I go to a really prestigious and expensive college in NYC, I felt like all of the money my parents worked so hard to save up and spent on tuition for me would've gone to waste if I didn't win this thing. Premed student or not, just being accused of something you didn't do while being completely innocent can ruin you, especially in college, where you're just starting to experience adulthood and independence, stuff like that.

After the professor pursued his case against me, I still didn't back down. I challenged his accusation and wrote out my appeal letter and sent it to the dean. I kept on going to his lectures, taking every single exam and submitting every single assignment and homework. I didn't miss ANY of that, and that's extremely important to do when you're faced with a false accusation like this. My professor stopped grading my work, though, and admitted he couldn't grade me fairly anymore because I was disputing his allegations. I reached out to everyone I could, the deans, my advisors, the department chair, to inform them of this. I was being treated like I was guilty by this professor, even while my case was pending.

After torturous weeks and weeks of waiting, I found out from my college's dean a few days ago that the case against me was dropped completely because my professor's claims were unreliable and his insufficient ""evidence"", which was an assumption, didn't make any sense. I had an incredible support system behind me throughout all of this, and I'm so glad my name was cleared. Just because of a stupid, careless mistake on my professor's side, my entire college career could have been ruined.

**So if you're falsely accused of an academic violation and you're innocent, DO THESE THINGS:**

1. During the initial meeting with your professor (if they offer one) to discuss the violation, make it clear that you didn't cheat, don't apologize for anything, explain your side clearly and calmly, and definitely communicate to the professor that you will be appealing the case if they decide to report you. **Don't let the professor take advantage of you,** because this is what happened to me. Had I defended myself properly, I wouldn't have been in this situation in the first place.
2. **APPEAL, APPEAL, APPEAL!** If the professor does end up reporting you, know that you have the right to appeal by your university. I'm pretty sure this applies to every single institution in the U.S, at least.
3. If you can afford an educational lawyer, definitely hire one. It's not necessary and they won't be able to directly defend your case, but it's nice to have someone who can help you write your appeal letters and come up with any evidence that you need to defend yourself.
4. Reach out to an academic advisor, the department head, the deans, whoever has some sort of power. Don't be embarrassed to inform them. The more people you have on your side from the beginning of the process, the better.
5. If there's an ombudsman/student representative in your university, TALK TO THEM. Set up a meeting and ask them to walk you through the process and what you have to do to protect yourself. They should even help you write your appeal letter. I didn't have an ombudsman at my college (weird, even though my college's law school is well known) but I had my advisor, class dean and the department chair on my side.
6. **Don't stop attending the classes** where you were accused of cheating in. Keep doing everything you would've normally done-- homework, tests, assignments, etc. Don't miss a single thing, seriously. If you do, it can make you look guilty, you'll look like you just gave up and don't care about your academics.
7. **Have patience.** Academic violation cases can unfortunately take a lot of time and you just have to wait to hear from the committee or whoever is going to review the case. Also, during the pandemic, there are a lot of academic integrity cases anyways because students are literally cheating left and right and getting caught red-handed, even over Zoom administered exams. However, there are other innocent students (like me) who didn't cheat and are being accused due to misunderstandings or just sheer negligence on the professor's side.
8. **Trust the process, and GET OFF REDDIT!!!** NO, your life isn't over. Breathe. Unfortunately I was an idiot and came to Reddit seeking help. I posted about my case (linked above) and desperately asked strangers for advice. Some people said that I'm not going to win the case and that my life is over. These comments really made me second-guess myself and my college. I thought that I would be convicted of something I didn't do, and that my college could indeed convict me of a false accusation. Turns out all of those negative comments are wrong.

Sorry for the long post but yeah, this is what happened. I could still sue my professor for defamation and mistreatment, but I don't think I will, because I don't care about him. It's really sad and unfair how some professors can get away with maltreatment and false accusations, ruining a student's life. But if you know didn't cheat, then don't worry, you will be fine. Remember to defend yourself and don't back down. If you did cheat and you got caught, sorry buddy, I don't know what to tell you. Actual cheaters deserve the consequences and that's all I'll say.

I hope this post was helpful. All hope is not lost. If you're convicted of something like this and you need someone to talk to or you need advice, I'd be more than happy to help you and share some of my wise wisdom haha.

646,Styling1998,1606013842,/r/college/comments/jyo946/might_fail_out_of_my_major_should_i_change_it/,"Title says it all. I’m currently a CIS major, but this is after changing my major at least two times (Nursing, New media and communications, CIS) due to fear of job prospects regarding my actual interests (film) and disinterest regarding nursing. 

There’s a requirement at the university that I go to that you only have two chances to complete classes in the school of business. Due to my declining mental health (I was hospitalized last year) I dropped my classes (5) after the add-drop period which screwed me since it used 1/2 of my attempts at completing those classes. This was at the start of COVID and all my classes going online overwhelmed me. I know I did this to myself, but I don’t know what to do now. 

I could attempt my classes again, focus 100%, and try my best to pass them but if I fail any of them I’ve wasted time, money, and might end up on some kind of academic/financial probation. I applied to another university with intentions of taking the classes I dropped there, but I may not be able to get all online classes and it’s a 40 min commute there and back as well. I’m heavily considering changing my major to psychology since I enjoyed my intro class, and I’ll have a degree in something. Even if I don’t do something related to psych I feel like I’d be able to sell it if I have the skills and certs (in this case IT) to be able to land a job. It seems like most employers (at least the ones here in Atlanta Ga) just want to see that you have a degree in general. 

I’m also aware that if i do plan on doing anything psych related I’d need a masters. Honestly I wouldn’t mind being a school counselor, or therapist if it came to it because it seems like a rather fulfilling career. Again, the pay/job prospects scare me away from it.

I just want a 9-5 job that won’t make me want to jump off a bridge, pays well, and gives me enough $$$ to fund my hobbies/interest.

Last year (freshman year) my grades were great, and I'm doing ok (still kinda meh so my GPA will be droppin like the stock market) for three of my classes, but I completely tanked my grade in one class because I had some technological difficulties when uploading pictures for an exam (I emailed my prof immediately after but she didn't care.

651,SNRNXS,1605324982,/r/college/comments/jtv1y7/i_feel_like_i_wanna_drop_out/,"This feels like something I'd post on r/self or some similar sub but since it involves college I thought it'd be better here.

I know that dropping out is a legitimate option, and lots of people do it. But I feel like if I drop out I'm just giving up. It's not like I've found a perfect job or career for me where I don't need a degree and drop out for that reason. I'm just a 2nd year college student. I only work at a grocery store deli weekends only because otherwise I'm a full time student. But I really don't think college is for me.

I was forced by my family to go into college under the idea that if you don't go to college you'll be stuck working at McDonald's the rest of your life. I know that idea is a bunch of bullshit because there's plenty of people who have led successful careers without going to college. I wanted to take a gap year after high school because I didn't feel I was ready for college just yet. But my mom said no, and forced me to go anyways.

That first semester I majored in architecture. I thought it was what I wanted to do; I had an interest in buildings, and after previously looking over all of the majors my university offers, that was the only one that stood out to me. Come the end of the semester, I had stopped going to my architecture studio class. I felt left out my members of my studio group. Everyone was making things much better than I was. I had no real will to continue in that class anymore.

I ended up dropping that major and going exploratory the next semester. That's when I discovered a new major coming from a satellite campus that had just expanded to the main one, where I was. It was an animation &amp; game design major, which focuses on 3D modeling, animation, digital design, etc. I figured since I like video games and computers it might work out well for me. That's what I've been doing this semester, and I'm starting to feel the same way as I did my architecture class. I don't feel like I'm into it. Everyone else in the class is making things much better than I am. I still have a good grade-- I think the professor must grade based on whether you do the work, not how good you do it. But at this point I'm just half-assing my assignments. I don't feel like I'm actually learning anything.

Some people go to college because they want the ""college experience."" Yeah, well I haven't had that. My first semester I was in a dorm room by myself (by choice; thank god I didn't have to share with someone). I thought I was going to reinvent myself after high school. Back then, I was quiet, not sociable outside my small circle of friends, and never talked unless spoken to or when I needed to for class. I never did any clubs, never went to sports games, school dances including prom, etc. I was never interested in any of it (I actually couldn't go to prom anyways because you needed a date, but I didn't want to go anyways).

Well, I didn't change in college. I never left my room except for class. I didn't do clubs because I went home on weekends (I lived in a dorm, but home was 50 minutes away, couldn't have my car though). No one ever really came out of their rooms on my dorm floor. I never made any friends and barely saw the two I found out also went to my university from high school. I mainly stuck to talking with old friends online, which is really what I always did.

Then COVID happened.

We all got sent home in March. I was so glad, I hated living on campus. My fall semester I made it so it was all online, otherwise I would've needed to pay for a dorm room to literally be there one day of the week for a class I was previously scheduled for that wasn't online for that one meeting time. I did the same thing when I scheduled for spring. But because everything is online, I feel like I'm learning nothing. Well, for most classes I prefer to do it online because they're bullshit core classes that need not exist and I can just google the answers to. But with my current 3D modeling class, even though I watch the videos my professor posts and follow along, I still feel like I've learned hardly anything at all.

The same goes for a Java programming class I have to take. I was never into coding and am only taking it because it's required for the degree, but even though I follow along with the videos, I feel like I learn nothing. Well, maybe I would if I read the textbooks. But I cannot be made to read 40-50 pages per class each week of nothing but text. Hell, I can hardly read story books, I am so burnt out of reading walls of text.

I'm just feeling like maybe college isn't my thing. But dropping out and not knowing what to do with my life isn't my only problem. I'm not in any debt-- I haven't taken any loans to pay for college. It's all been paid for via FAFSA and my mom. She's pretty well off, owning her own company. I don't know how much she makes, but it's enough to cover what FAFSA doesn't and still buy a $50K Ram here, turn around and trade it in on an $85K Lincoln there, etc.

She's paying for my college, and expects me to go through and finish it. If I dropped out, it would absolutely piss her off. I can't imagine what she would do then. Essentially she would've wasted $20-some thousand by now (luckily because I'm not living on campus, all of my classes were covered by FAFSA this semester). I don't know if she would expect me to pay it back, which I sure as hell can't do. Also, back when I dropped out of my architecture major, I didn't tell my mom about it. I figured she'd be furious. The day I went home for winter break, she asked me how everything was going, I just said ""fine"" like usual. But she knew. The day we went back, she said, ""when are you going to tell me that you dropped out of architecture?"" She was mad about that, and on top of it that I didn't tell her. I can't imagine what she'd do if I fully dropped out of college.

And then there's my dad. I haven't lived with him since he divorced my mom when I was 3. He sometimes visits for a couple days or a week or two per year since he's busy with being full time in the military. But recently when he came to visit in August, I told him about my major. He was so excited and supportive of me taking it, saying how it was the future, one of the biggest upcoming industries, etc. If I drop out, I'm going to extremely disappoint him. Not only that, I'll disappoint everyone in my family to the point where I'm pretty sure I'll become estranged.

I just don't know what to do. I don't feel any motivation to keep going through college. But if I drop out, I don't know what to do. I don't want to disappoint my whole family. I don't know how I can go on. Nothing seems to interest me enough to make a career out of it. And of the things that I do have interest in, either you can't really make a career out of it, it's very high risk, or unrealistic. I like video games, but what sort of job can you make out of it? Streaming? I already know I'd be a bad streamer, and if my mom saw me drop out to do that, she would kill me. The only other stuff I regularly do is watch TV shows, movies, or Youtube videos, and of course I can't make a living doing that. I like cars, and if I could do anything I would like to try and design cars and manufacture them as my own brand, but that's unrealistic for someone like me to do. The only thing I have left is maybe writing. I've been wanting to write a story for a long time now, coming up with tons of ideas and whatnot. But hardly any authors become successful, and it's not something I can just bank on happening.

Hi, i’m really stressed out currently at my prospects for college.

In Fall 2019, I was admitted into East Carolina University, got A’s/B’s for 3/4 months, but ended up slipping and landing in Academic Probation due to an underaged drinking incident. Due to alcoholism, minor drug abuse, medication running out, mental health, and also my own lack of academic responsibility at the end of the semester, i ended up getting F’s and D’s in my classes.

After semester 1 concluded, i withdrew in January of 2020 as my advisor recommended that i withdraw, “regroup”, and re-admit. Since then, i admitted myself to a Rehab facility, completed my program, started AA/NA meetings, and have begun working a job and looking into re-admitting to a college in Florida as i’m moving back home to Orlando.

My question is, do i have a chance at attending college anymore? My high school GPA was a 3.125 with an ACT score of 26, and i’m currently doing an ACT prep course to get a higher score for admission. I don’t have any credits to transfer over. Does my GPA and withdrawal from a previous university bar me from attending another college? 

Do i apply as an incoming freshman as i don’t have any college credit or as a transfer student as i had completed one semester at a different university?

Really beating myself up over this, i want to continue my education and UCF has the program i’m seeking, as well as being located in my hometown Orlando, but i don’t know if my previous fuck up is gonna screw my life over. I’ve read that at most colleges, GPA’s don’t transfer, only credits, so all i have to do is apply and be competitively selected. Right?

Hey Everyone,

26  y/o student here (I don't study in the US, in my country this is the  normal age to be studying undergad). I'm in my first semester of my  sophomore year of university studying a Statistics and Data Science  major, so obviously math-heavy and intensive.

In  short: my major is very difficult for me, and I've noticed after last  year that I'm doing worse than most of my peers to the major. For  example, in the class grade statistics, I've noticed that in all my math  courses, out of almost 100 students, my grades are basically in the  lowest 30 students for each course. I'm not failing by any means, but I  am getting high 70s (C+'s basically) after busting my butt a lot.  And  it's an indication that most of my peers are understanding the material  better than I am. The only course I did very well on was Intro to  Programming which gives me confidence in my reasoning and  ""puzzle-solving"" skills. However, most of the material- proofs,  mathematical problem solving, etc- I simply have a hard time, seems like  more than others.

The reason I  chose the major is because it seems to be a great, in-demand skill, I  don't mind the math aspect (I'm not dreading my life) and it can be  applied to many industries. I don't fear a challenge, and I noticed I am  actually learning a lot- when I reflect on last year, academically, I  did learn a lot of new things and ""improved"" myself, you could say.

Last  year I also double majored in Geography which I received almost all A's  in, much easier for me- I'm very good at writing and conveying ideas,  presenting/public speaking, researching and all the stuff that makes for  a successful social-science major. However, while those skills will be  relevant to Statistics as a career (presenting your findings and such),  those skills are ""on-hold"" while I am learning the rigorous math. I  dropped the Geography major because I felt I wasn't learning much,  though.

I'm wondering if being  stubborn and finishing the major with sheer brute force (something I  picked up from the military, just pure grit and determination) is  actually hurting me or my career prospects. First, without being a  self-fulfilling prophecy, I just don't see myself finishing the major  with a stellar GPA (think barely a 3.0 if things continue on their  current path), and I understand this could severely limit grad school.  But also in terms of career- if I have less of a natural ability to do  Data Science, why would I go to this career and compete with others who  are better at it? Wouldn't I want to leverage my strengths at this  point? I feel like I'm a baseball pitcher practicing swinging a bat: I  could use it to become a better player overall, but I should focus on  pitching, no?

Discipline and  motivation are not my problem necessarily. Neither is a desire to learn  and improve, or fear of challenge/difficulty. But I have 3 courses this  semester in Stats and after a few weeks I'm very behind already, and I'm  bracing myself for another semester of studying for hours on end  (including tutoring and practice exams and youtube and all) just to  receive C+'s. So that leaves me pretty confused.

Hello, I am in a private college studying to be an electrical engineer. I started by 1st semester here in the fall. After talking with my mom, gf, and self reflecting, I've decided that I wanted to go down the electrician route. I applied and got accepted into a trade school (which has a really good electrician program) which I will be attending next fall. Between here and next fall, I will be working full time night shifts as a robotic welder and splitting $600 rent with 3 of my buddies. I currently owe 4,000 (non-loan, just payments) to the college I am at as well as grants, scholarships, etc... My tuition was around 26k for the first semester (YIKES!). I don't want to continue college and would rather start working now. (I have no interest in going back to electrical engineering)

\-I'm deciding whether I should finish the semester or drop out now (my grades are decent. Lowest is C+ and I have a few As)

My questions:

Will dropping out mid semester look bad on my record for applying for scholarships to the new college? 

Should I even mention in future scholarships that I dropped out and my reasons for doing so (change in direction, I couldn't afford it and didnt want to take out private loans) and then explain that I didn't see a point in continuing.

Will dropping out mid semester vs when semester ends worsen my financial aid?

Will there be scholarships or grants that I have to repay if I drop out midsemester vs end of semester?

General Advice?

My only concern is what is better financially for FASFA and scholarships.",college,Bennifits/Negatives of dropping out,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jrh3om/bennifitsnegatives_of_dropping_out/,1605013419.0

Nearly two years later I feel extremely directionless and unsatisfied with most parts of my life and over the last week I earned my diploma from my original high school. 

With me having this diploma now, would I be allowed into most any community colleges regardless of how poor my academic performances might have been for a good chunk of my high school experience? 

Along with that, I’m admittedly not a very academically talented person. I’m decent in English and actually very high preforming in any political/history focused class (though I imagine most people are) and struggle with science and I have a learning disability in mathematics that I feel like will be the bane of me ever achieving anything in my life lol. 

Could anyone suggestion fields that might be good for me to look into with that taken into account? I’m very passionate about things like politics, history, art, social sciences, psychology, journalism, law etc. Maybe something lacking less math or more simple math.

As I said, I’m not a very intelligent person academically or other wise lol. Is looking into something like community college a possible massive waste of money or am I safer looking at options like trade schools despite them not interesting me much?

Obviously I will keep descriptions to a minimum for confidentiality, but damn do I sometimes regret moving out of state.

Im on full scholarship-very grateful for that especially given my less fortunate background. I’ll be graduating with no debt and a semi-brand name on my resume, which is why I picked this school to begin with.

 

But it’s been a couple years now and I sure as hell do not get along with people here. Let me explain by bullet points:

 

some people are wayyyy too liberal. Some of the minority kids here don't stop venting about how oppressed they are at this pre-dominately white institution (that they themselves chose to attend dear god). 

most athletes here are standard douchebags/bros. Some teams are very problematic (even for today's political climate). nothing too much to be said here I just dont feel like doing coke or acid on the weekend with daddy's money lol 

And on the topic of social life, there's not much out there for people who aren't overtly preppy, on a club/varsity sport, or sell joints and juul pods on the d-low.

All the nerds/more quiet one's I've run into are either complete morons(will literally make jokes about race and disabilities), insecure(more people than I can count have dropped MONEY on video games, clothes, shoes), or hermits( will literally just stay in their rooms every weekend to watch dramas).

 

I'm pretty reserved myself (frankly I dont care what people think of me), but I make an effort to go out and meet people and get sloshed every now and then.

 

am I looking at this whole thing wrong? am I missing out on lifetime connections that are harder to come by later in life?

 

BTW: the guys on my floor are complete emotional lesbians. Will literally argue on the smallest thing just to be right, will fill any silence by making fun of someone, and are awkward as hell when I strike up any conversation with them not centered around sports, drinking, or some debatable topic.",college,Is it my fault that I’m not making meaningful connections in college?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jr6k0v/is_it_my_fault_that_im_not_making_meaningful/,1604974504.0

I've noticed many of my high school classmates some of them failed a class, graduating UW, (those who failed a class in HS probably did running start, and did well in it and transferred to UW).

I don't belong here in Washington or Seattle, apparently the vibe here and I are completely opposite. If you knew me in real life, I guarantee you'd hate me. (serious) Please don't post things like ""oh hate is a strong word"", please I've dealt with too many people who are either secretive, sugar coat things too much, or even bully.

I dropped out of UW because I flopped after 3 Successful Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeals, and after failing the 4th quarter (I needed to pass all 3 classes, but only passed 2) the 4th appeal form was denied. (so its 4 strikes you're out not 3). In case you're wondering the really hard classes that I struggled with is MATH 124 (Calc 1), MATH 125 (Calc 2), MUSIC 116 (music theory), ASTR 101 (Astronomy), POLS 201 (Political Theory).

I didn't go back to community college, because I was dealing with some minor case of PTSD.

Honestly, I did use all 4 years of grant money, and somehow I flopped. I did okay in the first 2 years but couldn't decide on a major, only decided on one to remove the 105 credit rule.

Could someone explain to me the difference between a dog person and a cat person? I figured not, this is the wrong subreddit for that.

I dunno maybe I didn't realize back in high school that I hated school. Its something I learned in AP Psychology called repressed emotion.

She said all I do is nothing and have no reason to be failing or dropping and to an extent she is correct. My grades shouldn’t be as bad as they are but I am currently taking 17credits and three of the classes I am taking I joined mid semester. Add that in top of my mental health and the fact that I’ve moved three times just in throughout the semester it is a mess. I have a lot of catching up to do and I think It would be almost impossible catch up on every class especially the two that I did zero work in. Anyway, she got mad, slammed my computer then took it. About 30 minutes later she came back with a list saying I needed to finish my job application and my driver’s license and then start paying rent. Then at the bottom of the list she said to sign a FERPA...

I get the paying rent and not just sitting around her house, I’ve paid her plenty of times but I’m pretty broke atm so I can’t pay a lot. I usually pay for my own food though, and other things. But my education I pay for myself, I’m to one who will be paying the loans, I’m the one who worked to pay for it all, I’m the one who paid for those classes I dropped. So I don’t see why she needs to see MY grades when I am paying for my own schooling???

 I feel like that’s crossing the line and I really don’t want her to know about my grades. In high school when she’d find out I was behind on an assignment she’d constantly breathe down my neck.

All of my classes are online except my labs. The first one I feel confident going into my linear algebra test. The first test we took was similar to the practice problems and I had this professor before. I had him before for calculus 3 and on the first test it was similar to the practice exam and I did great on it. Then he gives us this confidence that the test is going to be like this format. The second test comes and it was nothing like the first exam. Everyone does bad (I got 75% on it) and rants to the class about how we need to take our studies more seriously and let us fix our mistakes for the first 15 minutes of class and regraded the test. So I had a suspicious he would pull this trick on us so is study a little harder on the test. All the test we take are on MyMathLab and we were allowed one sheet of formula but no worked out problems. On MyMathLab it says we have 2 attempts but I talk about that later. So I go into the testing center and start it. I get I to the first few questions and their similar to the practice exam which is good. Then I got some questions that weren't on there and I was able to answer then fine. Then the final third of the test came and it was brutal. I though I knew how to do and when I turn in the test I see that I got a 62%. We were able to go back and see what we did wrong. If you have ever had experience with MyMathLab you know that there are no partial credit instead all or nothing. Feeling defeated since I felt like there was nothing I could to do better on it I go to his lecture next day to find out that student were taking the test test twice. See we had 3 options of taking the test. Taking it in person with him as the proctor, taking it at the testing center, or taking it with protorU. I took it at the testing center. The testing center on campus called him to verify because students were asking him.(I knew he would not do this.) They asked him and he said no. But the students that took it on protorU (which were slot) took it twice. Then the class got into an argument saying that he never told us we could not take twice and then he said he did and it was headache. In the end here was his solution. For the person who took it twice he was going to average the grades and for the people who took it once he was going to add 5 points (which would bring me up to a whopping 64%. I feel like this is BS. The people who took it twice have a bigger advantage. Since the test would be the same format. The students could have written how to do the problems and then retook the test and get a better grade. For example let's use my grade of 62% and let's say I retake it and get a 96 on the exam. The average would be 79%. If I took it once it would be a 64%. Do you see how unfair that is? I feel like calling him out on his BS and seeing if he would give partial credit on the exam  (which could earn me a 70% on it). I just feel defeated hopeless and powerless. He said go to the dean of students I feel like I am doing this fairly and willing to argue his point. I feel like I should go to do Dean of Students (I have a friend who is also I there that field this way) and report him but I don't feel like it will do anything since he is the top math professor at my University.

Then in another class (Electric and Magnetic Fields). I feel like my professor is grading unfairly. For reference this is the grading scale
25% Homework, Quizzes (worst 2 are dropped), Project
25% Test 1 
25% Test 2 
25% Final

I feel like this is unfair mainly in the homework and tests. We are given a homework and quiz every week. The project we just did was actually a good project. We had to make a motor and it had to go a certain speed and right a lab report. We were given supplies but here was the delimma. In order to get the supplies you would have to go to campus. But my school is actually 2 campus that are an hour apart. So to be able to get the supplies it would be a 2 hour round trip to get them and we were only given 2m at a time. The other option would be to contact the lab tech on this campus to come to the campsus and they would be a crapshoot because I would have to be on that campus he was going to at that time. We also had to go to the other campus to test the motor. Well since I didnt want to do that I had to buy a tachometer to measure it. In total I spent around $27 dollars for this project. I had to spend money so that I could do good. Then we had to submit a lab report and meet with him to discuss about. Now I don't know if he looked at them before but when I went to discuss it to him i feel like he just skimmed through my lab report and asked a few questions.

I look at the feedback and Iean it good feedback but I dont know what the point worth of each thing he marked wrong was worth. Which meant his feedback was useless to me. In other rclass the professor and very helpful in the feedback and describe where you went wrong and how to not make that mistake. Here is an example of his feedback: On Pb.1 (d) the 1/16 factor is incorrect, On Pb.2 (c)  you should use first the definition of the inductance L to justify the N^2 in deriving the formula. Again, the median length of the core (2*pi*r) does not involve the cross section radius of 2 cm. For that particular feedback we were allowed a formula sheet so I wrote the formula and did not derive it (it also did not ask you to derive). While he doesn't make me feel defeated as the first professor, I feel defeated because he has not given us feedback on any of the homework we have done and I do well on the quiz and I feel like he expect too much of us especially since we are online.

College started off ok had a 2.5. Biology major. Later on grades started slipping. But it was always one class that brought my gpa down(Calculus- F, Chemistry 202 D-). I was never on AP because My gpa was always over a 2.0.  Finally after junior year my gpa just dropped below a 2.0. Academic dismissal. I had a chance to take an easy class to get back in school but i was ashamed to tell my friends what happened. I wanted to graduate. So like an idiot I took organic chemistry. Strugled and failed. couldnt get back in. Couldnt get any old grades changed. Here I am a senior and now im dismissed. Never recovered. MOved back home, never went to class at community college. Went to another 4 year made friends but it wasnt the same. Missed my friends at my first school, stopped going to class. Dad found out, Had to leave and get a real job. Regular customer service gig and i hated it but stuck with it. Left after 3 years, got another help desk gig and then another. Ok money but Im better than this. Been stuck at mediocre jobs for years.  Finally went back to college a few years ago, got my bachelors. Yet im still not happy. I still feel empty without my degree from the first school. its like im always on Linkedin or Facebook seeing what my friends and just people I knew of are doing today.

(GPA might have been low but i would have graduated) Ive become obessed with finishing my first degree. I actually got accepted to finish. But the curriculum has changed so now I have so many new classes. So instead of taking me 1 year to graduate, it's gonna take about 2 years. But is i a BS in Biology even worth it at this point?

My wife is a grade school teacher and often works late. I never had an end goal in mind as a teenager so after I graduated high school I just went to work. I took some college classes but dropped more classes than I passed. I've had this voice in the back of my head telling me to do something more with my career and lately it's been getting louder. I don't feel like I need to have a better career to feel some hole in my life. I have a dream family and love them more than anything. But if I can make our lives better with an education, why not?

I'm a service repair technician for a nationwide service company. It pays well and has good benefits. I have 3 weeks vacation a year, sick days, personal days, about $40K in my 401K. Good health insurance. But the job itself is just ok though. Plenty of technicians retire from this company and I could easily do the same. I work on tons of different types of commercial equipment, but I'm getting bored and tired. It can be physically demanding at times. I see these old guys that have been with the company for tens  of years who have just destroyed their bodies doing this job and are constantly need shoulder, knee, elbow wrist surgery ect. My back and shoulders are already starting to feel the pain. Basically what I'm trying to say is I don't want to be doing this until I'm 65.

In my job i've gotten to work with different types of electronics, computers, mechanical and pneumatic systems and I'm fascinated by some of the  ingenuity that goes into the equipment I work on. I think I'd like to persue a career in some kind of engineering.

Now I never did great in high school, but I never really tried because I never had a desire to do anything with my education. I have basic math skills, never got past college algebra. I never got into physics, geometry or anything like that. If I did persue this I would be starting off way behind. I probably wouldn't be able to take more than 3 classes at a time because of my current work/home situation. Because of this I would really only be able to do online classes, if that's even possible. So by the time I finished the schooling, I would probably be in my early 40's.

But those are the consequences of not forcing myself to do the brain work when I had the opportunity. I guess my question is, do I even have a hope of getting an education and being able to use it this late in the game? Or am I just doomed to do what I'm doing until I retire?

Hello! I’ll start off by saying I’m currently 26 years old and bartend full time (I make great money but get no benefits so I need to start thinking about my future)!

I went to college straight out of high school Fall 2012 - Spring 2015, I went to college straight away because that’s what I’m “supposed” to do, although my home life was miserable. I was homeless age 17-18, bouncing around friends places, finally got on my feet financially and got my own apartment, but because I had to work full time and had no true idea of what degree I wanted to get I just didn’t try. I had no time, working late nights managing a Taco Bell, I had no support system in place either. 

My last semester I failed out completely because I forgot to withdraw before the deadline, and because of this my GPA dropped to a 1.94, so my FASFA was taken away. 


I then just started working full time as a server/bartender, worked to buy a house at 21 and now I feel I’m stable enough to return. I have a true passion for exercise science as I am currently a certified personal trainer, so I have the degree I want to achieve in mind: A B.S. in Exercise science. 

My original degree was in Biology which I completed 79/120 credit hours (all gen-Ed’s are complete equal to 37 credit hours) 

If I make the switch the exercise science I’m basically starting from square one, and I’ll finish in 3.5 years. 

If I get approved for academic bankruptcy, they will remove my last semester from my transcript and I’ll be back to a 2.4  GPA. 

My question is, has anyone here filed for academic bankruptcy to remove their last semester, and how did it go with getting your FASFA back? (And yes I know FASFA will only cover 6 total years of schooling, so I’m aware they won’t cover my entire degree if I restart, I will pay out of pocket for my last year) 
Do you think I should backtrack and throw those 42 credits out the window?

I could only take out a certain amount of federal loans to help and I couldn’t take out any private loans because I am a freshman so I don’t have any credit and my family is poor so their credit is bad. I talked to the financial aid office and they said that each college has a set amount of funds set aside for the students and to talk to the assistant dean or the dean.

So I talk to the assistant dean and she said that they would waive the drop/add date for me (since I was considering community college but didn’t want to if I didn’t have to because I would lose my scholarship) and to email her times that I was available to meet and discuss my options. She said that there was funds that they can give me - the most of it has been allocated at that point but that they could still help.

I dropped to part time and barely passed, dropping my GPA and causing me to lose my scholarship. I liked computers when I was younger so I thought that was perfectly fitting, but I wanted to do engineering which to my surprise, my mom said not to do because I wouldn't get a job. Mistake number 1, don't let anyone tell you what to study but you.

Fall 2016, I got to community college and tried the business route. It didn't interest me too much, but it was easy, and it was something. First semester, I did well alongside working part time again. Spring semester, same deal. The following year, I had a realization that I should pursue the engineering degree I originally wanted. I stayed part time that whole year so I could work and because I still wasn't entirely sure what I was going to do. Really the only notable class in my head throughout that whole experience wasn't photo class. I've been taking pictures since forever, so I took the class as a possible grade booster. It ended up being work heavy because it was a history of photo course, but it was the only thing that I was enthusiastic about. I got a 3.9 my 2 years in community college and things were seemingly looking up.

The year was up and I still haven't applied to any schools, so I just said fuck it and went to Rowan where my brother had just graduated. Fall 2018, I enter Rowan University as a math major with hopes of transferring into engineering, but I didn't make it into the program. I decided to stick with math because it was the only subject that made much sense to me as a younger student. I did decent that first semester and had a new found fire to get my degree. Calc 3 was and still is my favorite math course. Second semester, I started slipping into old habits again and dropped to part time again. I was failing 2 courses (probability and random variables and another) so I withdrew. Passed the others. 

Fall 2019, I was in intro to real analysis, ODEs, theory of numbers, and college geometry. I got A,'s in ode and theory of numbers,but almost failed the other 2 so I withdrew, leaving me to part time yet again. 

Spring 2020, things were looking up again, I took 2 photo classes (film/digital) to lighten the math a little bit. Ended up spending a lot of my focus on those instead of the math, but I was still doing decent in the math courses. Probability was one of those so I was looking forward to getting it out of the way. Then after having a meltdown, giving myself a concussion, and going to the ER, I hopped into a car for 26.5 hours and drove across the country to easy my mind. This was the last straw to actually push me into therapy after a decade of wanting to do it but never actually doing it. I got medicated, started doing better again and had another new outlook. Then Corona hit. School went online. I immediately knew this would lead to my demise. I barely scraped by in modern algebra, and failed probability again. The photo classes were easy A's.

Now fall 2020 and here I am in real analysis for the second time, already slipping up in it and am pretty lost in the other class as well (partial differential equations). The next semester I'm supposed to take the class I failed two times already. This is now probably my 4th time seriously considering dropping out and my mental health is starting to slip again. I have gone years with undiagnosed depression and anxiety and was just finally doing better. Got a girlfriend for the first time in my life at the ripe age of 23, started enjoying life for the first time, but here I am slipping up in school again and losing motivation to do anything about it. I used to be the Golden child. Everyone expected me to do well on both sides of my family. My parents, specifically my mom, as well as the rest of my family have all lost hope it seems. I get reemed at every family function about it. Typical Asian family bullshit. I'm now at the point where after all this time, I have nothing to show for it. Including my classes now, and next semester, I have 5 required courses to graduate with a BA in math, but I really really really don't think I can do it.  I've never had a break and have been working and going to school consistently for the last 4 almost 5 years, and am on my 6th year of school. I only have 109 completed credits and have like no other major options without adding more years of school. At this point, if I drop out, I don't even know what my family will do. Whether I graduate or not, my plan was to move out in August so my parents can downsize. I am a courier and do DoorDash and GrubHub and make about 45-50k a year working the hours I do now, but definitely don't want to try and hold onto that for much longer than a few years at the absolute most assuming I drop out.

688,Sapphyreopal5,1601349818,/r/college/comments/j1rerq/am_i_wrong_for_regretting_going_to_college/,"Before you read on, no I didn't choose a useless degree and no I won't graduate with 40k in student loan debt. In fact, I won't have to pay a dime in student loans because the Pell Grant paid for everything luckily. I'm graduating in December with good grades from an online public health education program here in NC at a state university where I live. I'm 29 years old, going to be 30 next month and I have a 5 year old. I've worked the entire 2 years I spent finishing my bachelor's degree and I hated every moment of it. I'm burned out, exhausted, and downright crabby all the time it seems now. I don't recognize myself these days. 

I regret it because I missed out on a lot of time spent with my son. I'm sad that I had to essentially hand him off to someone else for catching up on homework, doing quizzes/tests, etc. I did it all in the name of trying to better my and especially my son's future. But this has come at a great price. 

You see, I've struggled with depression for many years but now my anxiety is through the roof. I haven't been able to really enjoy much of my life since I went to school. Heck, I've been feeling rushed to do simple things like bath time with my kid. Why? I'd have homework to finish or a test to study for, or just catching up on other household chores. Did I mention I've been working full-time the entire time I've been in school?

If I could do it allover again, I would pick a certificate program that'd be guaranteed to land me a good job at a fraction of the opportunity cost and not to mention my already questionable mental health. Am I going to be happy graduating with a 3.9 from a decent university (maybe slightly lower because my grades are not all As in my last 9 credit hours lol)? I sure hope so, even though I decided after the way the CDC, WHO and our general healthcare system handled this COVID-19 thing, I'd be embarrassed to work in such a corrupt system with short-sighted, narrow-minded folks running the show. 

Many doors have shut on me during my time pursuing a career in healthcare. I was denied a promotion 4x at the lab I worked at for almost 5 years, was refused positions that'd transfer me out to better hours and higher pay 6-7x at the same lab, dropped out of a cardiovascular technology program 8 years ago, and hundreds of job applications at local hospitals all denied. Oh and don't get me started on me losing a job as a medical receptionist at a pediatrician's office after 6 weeks last year. I should've listened to the signs a long time ago health care is not my calling. I love science with a passion but I think it's more meant to be a money making hobby on the side or something. 

Tl;dr: I regret going to college because I feel I lost out on quality time with my adorable 5 year old son and think the universe has been trying to tell me healthcare isn't for me for a good while. If I could do it allover again, I'd pick a certificate and other MOOCs for credentials to get me a good paying job. Kids, don't feel like you must go to college, it's really not for everyone!

My advisor told me to consider changing my major to biology, which is something I've contemplated and would like to do.

I really don't want to graduated in more than 10 semesters total, and I would prefer 9, since now knowing 4 years is out of question. 

I'm also very worried because if I couldn't manage to pass my classes when taking one math, one physics, and one computer programming (MATLAB) course, and 2 easy ones, how will I manage when every single class is a science/math based course down the line? I am just very worried and really don't want to take more than 5 years of school.

Before I begin I just want to clarify that by no means do I feel entitled to my parents money. I know my parent’s money are theirs and mine are mine. I’ve also been working consistently since the age of 16 to support my living expenses, and I don’t ask my parents for money. But, recently I’m going through a problem with my FAFSA and it’s been effecting me a bit and I need your opinion on something important. 

At the moment I am a senior in college. I have a year and a half left until I graduate. I’ve never had a problem with financial aid, and they’ve been covering my full tuition consistently for the past 3 years...until this year. Prior to college, my mother would always say that she’ll support me no matter what and that she’ll pay for my tuition. Luckily, I received full coverage so she doesn’t have to...until this year. Now that we found out I may have to pay for college, lately my mother’s been implying that I should pay for them myself. Whenever she ask me about it, she’ll kind of imply it, but occasionally say she can pay for it (hesitantly). 

To be honest, I do have money saved up from the years I’ve been working part time. At the end of the day if I have to pay for it I can. I worked years doing part time at minimum wage jobs while attending school, which slowly allowed me to build up my savings. Financial aid is saying that this year I have 4K due for the fall semester. But, because financial aid is calculated yearly, most likely at the end of the year I will have to pay for 11k out of pocket (Fall+Spring+Summer semester). 

To be honest, I am okay with paying for it in the end because it is my tuition, but I feel a little hurt that my mom went back on her words. It felt like she promised me something and took it away. Growing up she always says that she’ll support my brother and I no matter what. Not to mention, my family isn’t poor at all. To go a little into detail, my mother owns a successful business(she works A LOT) and has a couple of real estate lined up. My brother also dropped out of HS so I’m the only person in the family that’s going for a bachelors degree(both my parents never finished college). 

I don’t know, I guess I’m just wondering what I should do. Should I pay for my tuition with the savings I slowed stashed away throughout the years(I was planning on using it for when I graduate, move out, starting my life, etc.), or should I let my mother pay because she said she would in the past even though she’s hesitate? Maybe I can ask her if we can split it it? Please let me know your opinion! Thanks! 


TLDR: Parent said would pay for my tuition when I first started college, but ended up never having to because financial aid covers it all except for the last year. I am doing my last year. Well off parent went back on her words about paying for my college(ish), is hesitant, but technically I can pay for my own college with the years of savings I saved up from working minimum wage since age 16. Should I let my parent pay for college even though they’re hesitant or should I just go, bite the bullet, and pay it myself because it is my tuition in the end?",college,Should I let my parents pay for college or should I pay for it?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/itqzgj/should_i_let_my_parents_pay_for_college_or_should/,1600259026.0

701,kingtrifecta,1599723192,/r/college/comments/ipyt79/how_do_you_know_you_dont_like_something_is_it/,"This is going to be long so prepare yourself 

I’m 20 years old. I graduated high school in 2018 of June. Ever since I graduated I had literally no idea what I wanted to do, I don’t think I really thought about it too hard or my future because I was so caught up in the present problems. 

When my family and I almost lost our home back in 2008 my mom quickly became a nurse to support are family. I always admired her because of it, and ever since then I always had an enormous respect for nurses, more than I ever had before. I wanted to be one so I could feel proud of myself, maybe even more than actually helping people?

So I decided why not become a nurse? I have no other career path, nothing really seems appealing to me so I’ll just do that. 

I went to a local community college and I only have two science classes left, and only five GE classes to transfer to a cal state. Only two semesters left. I have a 4.0 GPA. I have at least 90 hours at a local hospital that I have volunteered at.

Everything is lining up, taking classes is so incredibly easy for me, I know how to study. Everything else is the hard part. 

The problem for me is that I’m a person that struggles with anxiety on a daily basis, to the point where it makes me inconsistent in what I do. I’ve dropped a semester here and there, I’ve bounced from job to job (part time jobs) because of my mental health. 

Nursing isn’t like that. I can’t take nursing school in parts, it’s fast paced and it’s not something I can drop and comeback to. Once I’m in it there’s no going back.  

This pretty much apples to everything in life so maybe I should just disregard that in my decision making. 

I’ve volunteered at the hospital and I actually liked it, I didn’t LOVE it, but it was cool. I got out of my comfort zone and I loved discharging new moms or taking visitors to see their loved ones or delivering lab specimens. 

Talking to patients and helping them into the wheelchair felt like I had purpose in some ways...however there still is a part of me that felt off. I don’t know where that comes from no matter how hard I think, is it because deep down I don’t like nursing? Or maybe it’s just self doubt? 

No matter what career path I choose I will always doubt myself/be afraid so how I can dissect fear from distaste? 

Ever since the pandemic hit I’ve been questioning everything. I haven’t volunteered since March of this year, and I’ve been way too nervous to go back to the hospital. However there’s this itch that I can’t get away from. Everyday internally something is telling me to go back the hospital.  I just need to be in that environment I NEED to shadow a nurse as soon as possible, and to put more reassurance in what I’m doing-however it's not because I want to help patients, it's because I need confirmation. This might be an alarming wake up call for me. 

I was so ify about the future that I actually dropped my Physio class and thought it’s best to take this time to FINALLY finish my GE classes and take this time to self explore a little bit in other areas. 

It’s confusing, because i don’t know if I can handle this career but I really have no other options it feels like. Nursing is all that I have known for the past three years. It's what's comfortable, the idea of nursing is comfortable, but when I think about actually doing a CNA program or being more involved a wave of fear comes over me. It's hard to image myself as happy if I do nursing, the more I go into it...the more I'm in my head ""no this isn't for me...what are you doing...stop this.""

When I imagine myself actually going through with nursing, taking the TEAs test (basically a test to admit you into a school as an oversimplification) I don't want to do that. Maybe it's out of laziness I thought at first but it's out of a lack of motivation. I just don't know if I can force myself to do this anymore, the conflicting feeling is way too out of control. 

Not to mention I have been in this ""Youre already this far along so keep on going, just finish this"" syndrome. 

There's only two other career paths I see myself taking; business and psychology. But as soon as I think about this then my mind starts over analyzing in shit. Business seems cool and I think it's interesting but an actual career path in business? What even is that? It's so unpredictable. 

Then I think about psychology and I'm unsure about that because I don't know if I want to care for someone's literal mind, the most precious part of someone's being. 

I'm confused. And being in this pandemic makes it worst because my opportunities are limited. 

Maybe I should take a business/psychology class within the same semester and see where that goes? Maybe try a business internship? Read some autobiographies on peoples mental disorders and how it has affected their life? Maybe I could get inspired. 

Maybe I could look around and try to get involved something business related. I've never been this lost in my entire life.",college,How do you know you don't like something?

I live in the Bronx so although the cost of living is not as high as the other boroughs, it's still pretty high because it's NYC.  Right now, my parents are not working. My mom had a stroke earlier this year and is unable to work. My dad lost his airport porter job due to COVID so he is collecting unemployment. The amount he's getting is small and he is unable to find a job due to his incompetence and unwillingness to find a job. I try to help him apply for jobs, but he is unqualified for most of them so his only option is to work manual labor. However, he is in his 60s and his health is deteriorating so I don't know how I can help him anymore. My older brother dropped out of school because he lost motivation to continue and works as a security guard. However, the pay is inconsistent as he barely gets called to work. Most of the time, he's on his computer playing games. I work as a server at a restaurant, but have decided to take a leave of absence to focus on school and my mental health. I'm in the process of going for my security license and I occasionally do Doordash.

I'm taking Intro to Programming, Discrete Math, Calculus + a lab, Spanish, and a Writing Intensive course so I can graduate on time. However, despite me taking online courses, the workload is 10x more than in-person so I'm struggling to get the work done and work at the same time. Unfortunately, I'm also following the same path as my brother and losing motivation to continue so this contributes to me being behind. I'm behind in my programming and Calculus class, but on track in the others.

My mom didn’t go to college, she went to a 1 year certification program if that counts, I don’t have a father, so besides my older sister (who dropped out after 2 semesters) I don’t have anyone in my family who’s gone to college and been successful. 

I’m a Junior in Arizona. I have an Unweighted GPA of 3.56, a Weighted GPA of 4.19, and am ranked 32/459 (top 6.9% percent of class). I intend on majoring in Finance, Economics, possibly Political Science, or maybe another related field. I’m on my schools wrestling team, I was picked out of my class to compete in a SkillsUSA competition, but besides that I don’t have much else. I see a lot of people here do a ton of stuff to get into top 20 schools and Ivy’s, that’d be pretty cool, but I don’t think I’m shooting for that path. If some out of state school wants to give me money to go there? Yeah maybe. But probably gonna stay in state. 

1. Is it bad if I’m looking at colleges based on price or scholarships? I’ve always liked ASU, I like the night life of the Tempe and Phoenix area, but if NAU would like to cover my tuition every year to go to their school, I wouldn’t mind going north into the snow. Is this bad?
2. Is there really any way to graduate debt free? I’d rather not get sucked into 80 gazillion dollars worth of debt at 22
3. I’m thinking about going the route of 2 years at CC then transferring to a university, but my sister told me “just go all 4 years and take whatever scholarships. You’re young. Just live it up and enjoy it”. But she also has a $700 a month car payment and is broke. What are your guys’s thoughts on this? I wouldn’t wanna completely miss out on life just to save a buck though.
4. Does college choice really determine if you get good jobs after? Obviously a Wharton grad is going to be making big bank, but does it really matter if it’s state school A vs state school B?
5. Finally, is there any little tips or things I should be taking into consideration as well? I imagine you guys have spent quite a bit of time on these topics and probably found a few things.

But once I got to college, it’s like I couldn’t handle it anymore and just fell rock bottom.

I hope you are doing well amid this pandemic. My name is (my name) and I am considered a sophmore student at (school name). I am emailing in regards to courses I need to finish my associate's degree as you are my listed advisor. I have been in and out of college for the last 8-9 yrs or so and have struggled with college in general due to many different personal reasons. I am making the effort to get the help I need and would like to try to finish my degree. I have continuously dropped out or failed out, my GPA is below a 1.9 and I am on academic probation. I'm ashamed, embarrassed, and just disappointed in myself that my educational goals have sunk so far below what I thought possible. I think I need about 5 more classes and would like to really finish. I have always struggled with math and have not even tried taking the last credit needed. I know I will have to take remedial courses for that and am unsure what classes that would be or who I need to speak to about that if it isn't you. Every person that I have previously spoken to at (school name) has always been rude or just made me feel worse about my situation which is one of the reasons why I haven't tried to finish because I'm to embarrassed to talk to anyone about it. I would really appreciate any guidance as an advisor you can offer so that I can finally finish. Thanks so much!

BIG NOTE: I am NOT complaining about my ""problems"" that come with this money, just explaining my dilemma and asking for device. I know I am blessed and privileged.

I have always worked for everything in my life I have been working since I was 14 years old and have paid for basically all my necessities since then.  My grandpa on my mom's side is very very wealthy but doesn't give much to his family. His one gift is paying for our college, which is amazing dont get me wrong,  But I just want to put into perspective how I don't ever get handouts for most things. 

We always thought he would just donate his money if he died. He recently contracted bone cancer and I suppose his views shifted.  Now he is giving all his grandchildren $2000 a month for the rest of their lives, that includes me. I cant access it until I'm 21 (im 19) but it starts now which means when I turn 21 I will receive access to $48,000 and then will receive $2000 every month after that. Its life changing, and I dont know what to do when I get that money. 

Most people say put it down on a house. Its not that simple. I live in Idaho and I dont know if I want to put roots down here. I like Oregon, California, hell I like a lot of places. 

I could travel, but then would that be ""wasting"" the lump sum? Would I be disappointing my grandpa by using his money that way?

I could start my own business, I've always wanted to open an animal sanctuary or a doggy daycare/boarding place. Would that be too much of a risk? I'd also have to make a decision on where to put roots.

And college, oh man. I would have dropped out a while ago if it wasn't for my grandpa having spent so much money already on me. Theres nothing I could study that im passionate about, I won't be getting any jobs with my biology degree as I am not going to graduate school. Im trying to finish in three years so when I get this money I'm out of college and free to whatever path.

I was supposed to transfer to a 4 year university but ended up dropping my classes a week after I registered for them after attending orientation. It didn't feel right to be there at the time and honestly I didn't really love the school. To put in some context, those 3 years of community college I struggled mentally. I had 2/3 jobs at the same time I was a full-time art student. It was a heavy 3 years for me and I was truly exhausted mentally, physically, and financially.  I basically had a breakdown the 1st semester of my 3rd and nearly dropped out. Since dropping those classes, I decided to take a gap year and work to save up some money.

Since then, my gap year has come to close. I worked 2 jobs the whole time and bought a car. So I would say somewhat successful. I applied to university and ended up getting accepted into the one I wanted back in February. Of course I was super excited and ready to endure this new journey for the next 2 years.

If this seems well formatted (like I wrote this or some shit Ik that gets thrown around a lot on Reddit) it’s cuz I’m going out of my way to not ramble on seeing as I’m pretty stressed tf out right now. I also want to not give away my identity if possible so I put some extra effort into this. 

Only posting to r/college cuz I think a family member uses Reddit. Did not wanna take the chance. They wouldn’t be on this sub I hope. Let’s start this fucking rabbit hole.


I kinda lived with my grandparents for a large part of my childhood cuz my parents were drug addicts.  Come around Sr year of High School my dad comes back into my life, he’s making pretty solid money, and more of less is like “come live with me and your new stepmom. I’ll pay for your college and everything”. 



It wasn’t anything against my grandparents but we were poor as shit, I wanted my dad back in my life, and being real here he kind of owed it to me. He also was kinda bragging to me about how good he was doing so it’s like, yeah he wants to help I’m not gonna stop him. I wasn’t making him pay the full $30k a year tuition tho cuz I got good grades and shit, racked up some scholarships. But yeah my grandparents are old, a large portion of my family is fucked, mix in some Chemical X and they couldn’t really pay for me to go to college. I’m also premed if anyone is like “oh why not go community college”. I thought about it a lot. Sometimes I think I was born on a fucking bed of eggshells.

So anyway yeah my stepmom isn’t mean or anything, but I don’t really think they got together with the intention of me ever being an active part of their life. Seeing as they got married before my dad got back in my life. They also didn’t really discuss me moving in as much as it kinda happened with COVID. They didn’t want me at the dorms, even though they didn’t really want me at the house lokey. I know I said it was my dad’s idea and all, but yeah like I said it just seems like they were never expecting to get this far with me in their life. It also kinda feels like they’re afraid of me to parking my ass here cuz of their rocky relationship. It’s a whole lot of everything  and a lot of it ain’t good. But yeah my GP house wasn’t that much better, and by that I mean arguably worse. 

Let me also say this now she doesn’t use anything and I don’t think she ever has. My dad was a raging addict who was in and out of prison for fuck all everything. He was supposed to go away till I was done with fucking college but I guess he got into shock therapy? Idk he doesn’t really talk much about it. 

Anyways he recently got off of parole for his most recent debacle, and now I’m fairly certain he’s using again. They never said anything to me directly, but like I’ve heard their arguments and it’s like, I’m not an idiot and can put 2 and 2 together. They were arguing about some white shit on his nose like I’m fucking deaf. Yeah...did I mention they don’t hesitate to let me hear these arguments but can’t be bothered to sit me down for 5 min and talk about the situation? Hahaha life is good.

So anyways if my dad is using and going through a divorce, I’m probably gonna be stuck in the dorms till shit clears up. If it clears up. 

My stepmom is also a scary person at times (she’s never harmed me or anything but in general) and I don’t exactly trust her, in a divorce, to not to destroy his life financially and indirectly mine cuz yeah life be like that sometimes. They’ve both been extremely petty people when push comes to shove and I think it’d be nasty. 

That is of course assuming my dad doesn’t go off the deep end again and sniff 6 figures away in a matter of months. Which given we’ve lost a literal house to him before...idk I’m scared as a motherfucker. I know I can probably sort this out with my college if worst comes to worst, even if Covid comes back, but I mean, fuck, this probably means I take an indefinite leave of absence and go back to my grandparents for a year or two till I sort out my finances. And as you can imagine, my ambition isn’t as high as it could be right now. Idk if I’d ever go back if I dropped out now. Jesus fucking Christ almighty.

I also didn't have a job, so I was able to spend as much time as I needed on schoolwork and still have a decent amount of downtime.

It was too expensive for me to continue living on campus, so I moved back home and switched to online classes for my second year. I also got a part-time job that quickly became full-time because the turnover rate was extremely high and I didn't have enough of a backbone to say no when I was scheduled 40+ hours a week. I was extremely stressed and started dealing with some mental health issues. I would leave for work around 8 AM, get home around 6 PM and just want to curl up in bed and not do anything.

As a result, I failed a lot of classes, was placed on academic probation, and wound up dropping out because I was no longer eligible for federal grants and couldn't afford to take out more loans.

I'm 23 now and am regretting it. I've wanted to be a teacher for a long time and I've been seriously considering going back to school since I'm in a better place (mentally and somewhat financially).

So basically, I’m here thinking my last semester is paid for bc I have no financial means (especially with the upcharges) to pay this. I helped my parents with bills thinking that I was covered for, since they ANNOUNCED that I was covered for. School starts next week and I’ll get dropped if it’s not paid. I’ve attached screenshots of the application and my name on the brochures, but I’m scared they’re gonna pull something on me and I was lied to somehow in regards to the scholarship, delaying my graduation. No reply yet.

Where do I even go from now? Also, this is a huge state university so I’m really scared they’ll find a way to cheat me out of this.",college,What would you do in this situation if it was your tuition fees on the line?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ibu369/what_would_you_do_in_this_situation_if_it_was/,1597742036.0
719,SnotDoods,1597470106,/r/college/comments/ia21wo/difficulty_picking_a_major/,"To start, I’m 23. I dropped out of traditional school in 8th grade and went into independent study. At 18, I dropped out of that and got my GED. I got married, had two children, and now that my second is over 1, I’ve decided to pursue a career, and go back and get a better education, as my GED really hasn’t served me well. 

I’m completing my first semester in community college in the next couple weeks, and want to continue going. I’m in AZ right now, but plan to move, and I really want to decide on a major. I know I’ll know more as I move along through school, of course, and I don’t need to pick now, but it helps with my motivation to continue going with a clearly mapped goal in mind. An end result. 

I currently go to an online only community college, and I’ve always thrived more in an independent setting. I don’t follow lecture or in person teachings very well, so I’d like to continue on going through an online only (or hybrid) method to earning my degree. I also have the two kids with not a lot of help in terms of caring for them other than my full time working husband, so that’s another reason I’d like to keep it online. 

My favorite classes in school were math, first and always, and English. I used to write a lot, and yes I understand beyond algebra and get my best grades in mathematics. I’m a very analytical, problem solving type of person that’s not very, creative, I guess. I like organization and very methodical ways of doing things. I like to be independent, I’m not a very social person at all, and just mostly like to work alone. 

My first pick in careers if I didn’t have underlying circumstances, I would pick being an OBGYN or midwife (or L&amp;D nursing). This is genuinely a passion of mine and has been since I was very young. Second would probably be something like engineering, or something in environment. Lastly I’ve taken interest in genetics, politics, and forensics. I’m also thinking on pursuing computer science. 

Since I mostly have to stick to online or hybrid, my options go from wide open to slim to none. I have two children, and am open to homeschooling if it’s necessary (since I consider in person schooling as not something that worked for me and could quite possibly be something that could not work for my children, but who knows). I would like to at least finish my undergraduate degree, but wouldn’t mind at all continuing onto pursue a graduate degree, so length of time or cost really isn’t an issue if it’s something I’d really enjoy doing and would give me good opportunity. 

Based on what I know about myself and what I’ve shared here, what kind of degree sounds like it’s a good fit, or something that’s reasonably done due to my lifestyle choices, etc.?

However, my parents wanted me to attend a small private school. My top choice, F, rejected me. The private school my parents wanted me to go to, S, accepted me and gave me a good scholarship. I was mostly indifferent towards S (I stretched the truth hard after the tour) but I knew after I toured that I was going to end up there off of their wishes alone. Because they said I could only do fraternity rush at the small school as opposed to another big school I got in at, I relented and went to S. On the drive home from S, mom also informed me that I would be allowed to transfer if I wanted to after 2 years.

Present: Sophomore year starts and my excitement in going back to school is tepid at best. I miss my frat brothers and some other people but I’m just not all that hyped to start sophomore year. My first semester was great, but much of that had to do with the freshman high. My second semester was a totally different story. I was a victim in an incident with the guys on my floor (never told them about it as I didn’t want them to worry) that the HR department never contacted me back on, the deadness of the town on weekends became more apparent to me, and I just really hated my finance class to the point where I wanted to swap my major entirely! During coronacation, I realized that I just didn’t enjoy where I was at, lacked pride in my school and wanted to transfer after sophomore year to F, as they have a major (Sport Business) that I’m interested in and a center dedicated to Supply Chain Management (MBA prep right there). I’ve casually dropped hints over the summer that I want out. My mom, as F is her alma mater, sounded totally okay with it. My dad won’t hear it (He was opposed to me going to F in the first place had I gotten in).

I don’t know how to approach them on transferring. When I tried to bring this up over spring break they mostly brushed it off and told me I was just going through a rough patch (looking back I was, but still). They have a history of contradicting themselves too. When I toured my second choice, my mom said if that’s where I wanted to go (F2) then she’d be okay with it (I got into a higher ranked public school, F3, and she said that I could go to F3 but not F2). She also said after I got my SAT score that I was “too smart” for S and that they weren’t going to force it on me (looks like they walked back on that one too). I just know they’re just going to play stupid and walk back on their words and I have no clue how to convince them to let me transfer, especially into a major they’d consider a waste of time.

I attempted community college for one year, but was placed in very low level classes. Low even for me. Wasn't interested in paying thousands of dollars for elementary classes so I dropped out. 

Didn't have a clue what I wanted to do so I moved around, worked tons of jobs, and now I'm 28 with little to no passion or interest in anything in life. There is no job that I want or career that screams at me. I'm in the same place I was when I was 18.

* How do I know if an online college is legit? I know that's a dumb question. 

* How will I know if an online degree is acceptable to employers? Similar to how community college credits don't always translate to university credits, I don't want to get a degree that's not recognized by the large population of businesses. 

* Having not gone to school for a VERY long time, I do worry about self discipline. Are there certain colleges or degrees that are more flexible with ""do it at your own pace"" instead of a four-quarter-requirement-year ? I don't want a full 12-credit load.

* Are there placement tests, pre-requisites, and other ""obstacles"" in my future for an online degree? 

* Am I at all applicable for any financial aid considering my age? 

* Scholarships? Grants? No clue where to find or how to apply.

I don’t even know what year I am in anymore. I’ve lost count. I think I’ve been at college for a total of three and half semesters, but I’ve taken so many incompletes, withdrawals and even Fs that I’m afraid to look at my transcript anymore unless I absolutely need to. I’m too ashamed, it hurts to look at. 

I took my first leave of absence after just one semester at college. I started out so strong right away and absolutely adored my classes and my professors, and wrote two of the best essays I’ve ever written to date, but by the end of that first semester things had begun rapidly going downhill. I’m still not sure what happened, if it was laziness, ADHD, ADHD medication, poor study habits or a more serious mental illness but I was barely function by the end of that semester. I had literally no friends, but I didn’t mind. I had become obsessed with my English and philosophy classes, and was starting to see all of these amazing connections between everything I was studying, but totally neglected my French class which I ended up failing. I was staying up all night pacing around the campus, developing all of these theories, checking out thirty books from the library at a time, not really eating much or socializing ever, hooked on cigarettes and obsessed with one of my profs. I was making so many bad decisions but I was also really having a good time in my own little world in my head. But I was barely able to write a coherent sentence. My papers were starting to become more and more rambling and I wasn’t finishing them on time, sometimes at all. I eventually, slowly, developed a strange and elaborate paranoid delusion about my favorite professors and became very depressed about it, so much so that I felt unable to stay at school, even though being at home was the last place I thought I’d ever want to be. I decided to take a leave of absence. I didn’t tell anyone about the delusion because I was afraid of what would happen if I did, and at that point I had no idea it was a delusion. During my leave of absence I went to intensive outpatient therapy and was diagnosed with social anxiety and bipolar disorder and prescribed abilify and Wellbutrin, which my mom didn’t want me to take so I never took. Later they would take back the bipolar diagnosis. And then give it back to me and then take it back again. 

My delusion eventually went away after a long time and after telling therapist about it finally and being shocked into reality. I went back to college in the fall, and did okay. I stayed for spring. Did okay but struggled, barely keeping my head above water. 

My mental health declined gradually the next couple of semesters, and I was never as motivated or brilliant as I was that first semester. I wasn’t doing any of my work or getting out of bed. I was obsessed with life memories of my father French kissing me as a child and could not stop thinking about it. I got a little paranoid and even called the police because I thought my roommate was being sexually assaulted but apparently she was listening to music. I started to believe I was suffering from all sorts of terrible diseases. Eventually I became so stressed and depressed and confused that I was hospitalized in a psych ward for nine days. There was given abilify and had such a bad reaction to it I nearly died. But I didn’t seem as unhealthy as the other people there and to this day I don’t think I deserve to get any slack because I feel like my problems are mostly my fault. 

I’m on my second medical leave now and I’m living with my mom, working at a restaurant. I just share my money with my mom who doesn’t work. We don’t have a house of our own and just bounce between a bunch of places. It can be stressful at times. I’m worried I’ll never be able to succeed. It’s been four years and nothing has changed or been clarified or resolved. It just keeps getting worse and I lose motivation every day. My future looks nonexistent.

I just took a class online which I barely passed but I did. I feel like such an enormous failure. I am still living with my mom at 23. I can’t even drive. I am hooking up with this guy who won’t actually be my boyfriend and even though it makes me feel bad Im afraid to end things or ask for more emotional support. I think he came inside me, and didn’t tell me, and got me pregnant. I had to have a medical abortion a couple weeks ago and didn’t tell anyone. My mom would have murdered me. I don’t know how he would react. I feel so guilty about all of this. I’m such a fuck up. 

I still don’t really have a diagnosis except depression and anxiety. I’m on depression meds and they help. A lot of psychs that I’ve been to try to prescribe me antipsychotics but I’m really afraid of them and my mom is skeptical of mental health field in general. She doesn’t like any of the therapists I’ve been to. I’m afraid of bringing it up to her because she gets upset when I do it seems. Right now I’m not seeing anyone, and just being prescribed antidepressants and add meds by my regular doctor, my mom tells me not to tell them everything because they’ll make me see a psychiatrist who we can’t afford and who will make me take meds that are dangerous. And im scared to be honest since I had such a scary reaction to antipsychotic medication last time and my blood pressure dropped so low. But I need the approval of a psych to go back to school. Right now it feels like I will never be ready to go back. And my mom needs my help here as well. And I’ve already wasted so much of my family and my university’s money. And the states money (during my hospital stay). 

I am likely going to need 2 more full years to graduate. Right now I am on my SECOND leave of absence. I’m amazed they haven’t just kicked me out yet. My dean says my professors say I’m brilliant and they believe in me but I think she’s just saying that to be nice. It’s a very expensive liberal arts college am on a ton of financial aid so I’m taking up the college’s resources.

I can’t even walk down the halls of my university without feeling shame.

I was in the high school class of 2019. Fall 2019 I completed 9 credits and spring 2019-20 I ended up dropping out. This summer I then enrolled back into the Uni that I dropped out of, but I'm wondering if it is too late to be applying rn, or if there are schools that have rolling admissions that I can have a shot at. 

The Uni that I attended.. I didn't like it from the beginning. I liked nothing about it, the only thing that kept me there that long was/is the fact that they pay for 75% of my tuition. But it is an incredibly racist and conservative PWI. They don't even try to hide it. I had a horrible experience. But i'm torn between dealing with it and basically having my tuition paid, or going elsewhere to have an overall better college experience.. in all aspects. I will apply/go to any uni in any state of America as long as I know I'll like it and be valued there. 

Also... no one in my family wants me to go back there. Everyone is willing to work a little more to make ends meet for me to go somewhere else.. I'd basically be going against my family by going back because they reeeaaalllyyy don't want me back there, but I can't see myself being accepted anywhere rn and idk if im willing to take another semester off, I'm already 'behind' (yes ik we all go at our own pace, but I'm eager to finish my schooling life) 

Another thing that's worrying me is *even if*  I do get accepted to another college, it would mean I'd be getting the scrapes of everything. The bad dorms, classes with profs no one wants to take, etc. And also.. with corona a lot of schools had to change how they're doing things.. and I can already foresee the big confusion that's about to plague everyone. of course I'd prefer to be somewhere that's familiar in the midst of all the confusion, but at the same time, this could be a great time to transfer so that I deal with that change right along with everyone else.",college,Great Colleges With Rolling Admissions and High Acceptance Rates?

Part of it was because I wanted to have a better future for myself: I'm from a low-income family with 7 siblings, so if I wanted options for better schools, I'd have to earn money through scholarships and grants. At least, these were the kind of things my family told me: I needed to get good grades to get into a good school. Even though I had no idea what I wanted to major in, I still worked hard to get the best grades I could, doing everything I thought would look good on my college applications.

When junior year started this fall, I was doing fine. I had APUSH and AP Lang along with Pre-calc, but I had been using a planner to keep track of my schedule. But right around late November, things completely changed for me. I discovered some ignored traumas in my life and because of this, my mental health declined sharply. I'm a serious procrastinator, but all of a sudden I couldn't do any of my schoolwork. I wouldn't participate in class anymore; most of the time I was sleeping or just had my head down.

For the 1st semester, my GPA was a 1.2. I failed Pre-calc, just barely passing my APs and the rest of my classes thanks to a good score on exams. I dropped both of my APs and went to Gen Ed classes. I had never had any kind of experience like this before. Maybe every once in a while I'd get a poor grade on a test or a paper, but failing a class? Dropping out of two? It made me awful. Like I wasn't good enough.

I started the next semester a little better--having classes with a lighter workload definitely helped. I got extra help from teachers, even staying after when I had to. I was trying to keep up with things again. I had also started therapy. I was a little worried if I would pass my junior year, but I kept working. Then we were sent home from school. And just a few weeks after that, my high school decided to use a pass-fail system for students (we couldn't do online schooling) and I ended up with a G (pass) on all of them. So much for SATs and final exams. And while I have definitely benefited from this, I'm also officially a senior now, which means that I have to think about applying to colleges in the fall.

 And this is where the problem is. I don't what my next step is. Part of me wants to wait to apply to colleges, or just start a few CC classes close by, but there's the other part of me that still wants to go to a school somewhere. I've been living with 9 other people since this quarantine started, so the opportunity to permanently leave my house is very desirable to me right now. And I've also dreamed about going to college ever since middle school. Even if it most of it was based on fantasies, even if I had no idea what I wanted to do, I still wanted to go. 

So right now I'm asking for advice. For those of you who had similar situations--whether it was in high school or college--what did you do? I know I'm being dramatic right now because what happened to me isn't rare or unheard of, but having some guidance would be super helpful right now. I don't know how to talk to my parents about this (or to anyone, actually) and therapy is kind of unavailable at the moment so getting input from strangers on the internet is the option I took lol.",college,A rough junior year has left me feeling lost about college.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/hjazz0/a_rough_junior_year_has_left_me_feeling_lost/,1593630919.0

My mental health has taken a nose dive since going into quarantine. My depression has always made school 200% harder for me. I have gone to therapy and all of that. I have tried my best to overcome and cope with having depression. I am just angry that this same story is repeating itself for me. After completing high school I took a year off and took some classes at a community college. But i dropped out of the community college because i was going through a rough period in my life. And i regret doing that in hindsight. 

I want to withdraw from all of my classes and take some time to really address my depression and perhaps look into getting medication, as i have tried therapy and that wasn't really as successful as i thought it would be. But i know this won't go well with my parents. They saw me drop out of community college and waste money. I also fear that if i drop out now i may lose interest in continuing.

I was going to my local community College in Houston about 5 years ago. I was a stupid teenager and I had no real guidance in life. My parents were always in jail, so I was on my own.

I tried the whole college life, but working small jobs put actual money in my pocket and I needed to support myself. Money became more of a focus for me than academics. 

I never had enough money to support myself. I'm not going to go into the whole pity party shtick, but I had some pretty dark times.

All this being said, I was always trying to improve my financial stability, in hopes of not turning out like my parents. Naturally I gravitated towards sales. I am a commission only sales person and COVID-19 has shown me I need to get out of this industry. Most companies in my industry will happily let us starve and provided no help.

Problem is, I couldn't afford to pay off the federal student loans from when I dropped out and they went into default status. 

I want to go back to school and learn a trade. I would like to become an air craft technician. MIAT is a college near me. The tuition isn't terrible to attend but I worry that with my prior loans in default status I will be turned away. 

Does anyone have any thoughts they could share regarding the whole that I have dug for myself?

First, I had gotten a F in AP physics 1st semester of senior year. Due to the workload and stress, I had ended the semester with a F for AP Physics and I had reported it to the UCI portal a couple days ago.

Second, I had dropped AP physics and Spanish 3 second semester. As I said above, I was going through a lot of stress so I had decided to drop AP Physics and also reported that I had dropped the class to the portal a couple days ago. However, for Spanish 3, given the circumstance, my high school had offered students to withdraw from classes this April with a 2.5 gpa and no penalty (according to my counselor, the 2.5 credits of Spanish will be posted on my transcript so it should count towards a-g, but will not provide me with the full year). I haven't reported Spanish 3 yet because I heard from somewhere that dropping a class and withdrawing a class are two different things and the portal only has a section for reporting a dropped class (I emailed my high school counselor about it just now). 

I tried emailing the admission counselor, but I only got automated messages that have nothing to do with the question I asked.

So, based on the information I provided, I was wondering what the likelihood of me being rescinded is for getting an F first semester and dropping two classes second semester; I had done a lot of extracurricular activities that makes me stand out from other students, but the two things that I listed above worries me.

I went to a college back in 2013. I dropped out of college and decided to go back in 2016. I went to a different college in 2016 and received my associates. I’m currently taking classes at a third college to finish my bachelors. They require I send over all education history including an unofficial and official transcript from the first college I went to in 2013. I have been going back and forth with 2013 college for about 4 months for them to release my records. These are the events that occurred: 

1. I contact 2013 college and tell them I need an unofficial transcript. They tell me they cannot release my transcript- don’t give me further information. 
2. I contact 2013 college again asking why they will not release my transcript and no one has any idea why there is a hold on my account. 
3. Finally I get in touch with someone who seems to know what they’re doing and they tell me I need to “reregister” to their school in the year 2020 just to get my unofficial transcript released to me from the year 2013. That “should” remove a hold on my account.
4. They remove the hold on my account for registration but I am still unable to send the unofficial transcript to the college. I question them &amp; they claim I owe them $30 to the college for the year 2017 which I never attended. 
5. I question why I owe $30 when I did not attend nor register for anything to do with that college in 2017. No one gets back to me. I got so fed up that I screenshotted a photo of the unofficial transcript and doctored it up to send to my current college. 
6. My current college for my bachelors still needs an official transcript. I fill out a form and pay to get my official transcript from 2013 electronically sent to my current college. I also paid the $30 fee that I have no idea what it’s for but I’m so fed up at this point. No one sends me a confirmation email or gets back to me for a week and a half (even though they guarantee the transcript for 5 day delivery). 
7. I email college again after waiting a week and a half and ask them the status of my transcript being sent. They email me two days later saying they never sent the transcript because they don’t send transcripts electronically to “my particular school”. 
8. I question them as that is not what it says on their website, but they argue with me and say they do not. So I send ANOTHER email and ask how my transcript gets sent then. I wait 4 days and they get back to me saying I have to give them a mailing address but it could take up to a week to be delivered. 
9. I send them the address for my school with identification. That was three days ago. Still no response, no update. So today I email them asked an update... no response also. 

To add, I gave a 3 week period before end of registration for summer semester for the transcript to be sent. So I missed the deadline now for my summer semester which has now messed up my further education.

I already have an Associate of the Arts which I earned in May 2018, but I wanted to take a break from school because near the end I was beginning to hate college a lot.

I've applied and (subsequently backed out) of a college application four times since 2018. Two times they were for the same school.

* First time was for a University in a city 1 hour away from me. I ended up backing out due to a combination of various issues, big one being too afraid to leave my friends and my four-year relationship behind.
* Second time was for a technical school in my city, but the program I was applying for was cancelled due to not enough people signing up
* Third time was again for the same University, but I backed out because of cost. (I did the numbers and the amount of money I'd have to take out with financial aid was just too much for me to bear). On top of not having any confidence in myself to be able to finish.
* Fourth time was for my local community college, looking into getting an Associate of Science to see if I can at least work somewhere that pays above $10 an hour. But then the pandemic hit and they reported that they'd be doing online-only classes, which I am 100% against doing as stated before.

At this point, I hate myself because I can't make a damn decision. I honestly have no idea what career I want to work for, nothing interests me anymore. I initially at my community college when I was working towards my Associate of the Arts was majoring in Computer Science, but I dropped out of the major pretty early on because I failed Calculus after doing really well in Trigonometry. It was a major blow to my confidence and I decided to go undecided the rest of my two years there because no other major interested me. Luckily Pell Grant paid for all of that so I'm not in debt. I was at one point looking into learning programming but the caustic online communities that I sought help from made me hate the subject and I can't find it in my mind to go back to it.

Long story short: I originally enrolled at this school in 2014 and had to dropout shortly after, but I didn't withdraw right which put me in a  warning. This past fall was my first full semester, which I passed with all As and one B. This semester, spring 2020, I passed with straight As. My cumulative GPA is 3.84.

Here's what's breaking my heart and stressing me out: when I registered for my fall classes, the advisor didn't guide me right which resulted in my not being registered for enough credit hours. So, despite passing my classes, I got put into a failing SAP status. I had to drain my savings to pay for this semester - spring. I triple checked with the advisor I was assigned to this time when I registered for classes and the financial aid office itself in January right when classes started to make sure I was registered for enough hours this time to put me in good standing. The resounding answer was ""yes, as long as you pass all of your classes."" I worked my butt off and passed all of my classes, as mentioned above, with straight As. BUT here's the kicker. The calculation they did with my overall attempted hours between all 3 semesters, the one in 2014 that I dropped out of and these past 2 semesters (38 hours) multiplied by the 67% completion rate I needed came to me needing to complete 25.46 hours. Between these past two semesters, I would only have 25 hours.They told me the .46 would drop off and the 25 completed hours would be fine.

Well, this semester ends and their program keeps me in a failing SAP status over that .46 that apparently didn't drop off. I have contacted them until I'm blue in the face and the person I did get ahold of told me that she would manually fix it for me and put me as passing because I am under one full point from passage so that allows her to make an adjustment. She hasn't fixed it though. I don't know what to do. I have emailed her again asking - politely - if anything is wrong with fixing my status, but I haven't heard back. I worked hard, did everything they told me to do, and I still get screwed over.. twice!

So this is my question:
Will my SAP status reset if I transfer to another community college? From what I googled, it says that is a loophole and that I could start with a fresh good standing status which would make me eligible for full aid again.

I'm an incoming sophomore in undergrad. I had a lot of AP credits from high school and took summer dual-enrollment classes so almost all of my gen-ed requirements were finished before I even started college. For that reason I felt like I had to pick a major right away first semester of my freshman year. This turned out to be a really bad idea. I chose Speech Pathology because my mom suggested it, and convinced myself that it was the path for me, but finally I faced up to the fact that I actually abhorred it (I have absolutely NO interest in the human bodily anatomy and hate touching people) so I dropped the major. 

Since then I've had a really, really hard time choosing a major. 

Part of the problem is that I am naturally an extremely indecisive person. I only applied to two colleges and withdrew my application from one of them because I knew if I got into both I wouldn't be able to choose (I know that's stupid, but I was trying to make my life simpler and deep down I knew I'd be happy in both places). My college offers hundreds of majors and minors, and selecting one or two of out all of them seems impossible. 

Right now I am strongly considering a psychology and economics double major (I took both of those subjects as AP classes in high school and really liked them), but I know that economics is probably going to be a bit difficult for me since pre-calculus was rough for me (I took it senior year of hs so senioritis was probably part of the problem) and I have not yet taken calculus. (I should add that I'm also interested in Industrial Organizational Psychology as a career). However, I feel like I SHOULD be a marketing / communications / english major because I LOVE to write more than anything else, I'm pretty certain at this point that I want some kind of career in business, and I know I'd be able to get a high GPA and do well in these majors. But the issue is that I don't really WANT to do them; I'd rather do psych and econ even though it will be harder and I'll probably get a lower GPA.

The main thing keeping me back besides my work schedule, is that I'm unsure if I should just continue from the classes I left off at if possible, or if I should retake the beginner courses I already passed in my first few semesters due to the fact I've lost a lot of what I learned. Though I have all my old textbooks so that may help to a certain degree.

I assume a lot of you might suggest I retake them, but I already have the credit and want to pay out of pocket, so I REALLY want to avoid paying a second time for classes I've already passed.

768,loneyboisadface,1588712650,/r/college/comments/ge64t7/i_have_lost_my_motivation_to_finish_college/,"  

The past year I've been dealing with a lot. I'm a college student and I've pretty much lost all my motivation to continue my studies and I'm trying to understand why. 

I think it all started summer of last year, I was taking summer classes with some mutual friends in my program. I had a falling out with these friends and one day when I was in class I went to the bathroom and left my phone on my seat. While I was in the bathroom my phone started ringing and one of my classmates answered my phone. It was my sister who wanted to know if I could pick up my father at the airport. This classmate impersonated me, was rude asf to my sister, and hung up in her face.

When I came back into the classroom my Professor asked who ""Mary"" is, I told her that was my sister. the professor then made a joke that my classmate would call her later and the whole class started laughing at me, the guy who picked up my phone was high fiving those old friends. What they didn't know is my father is very sick with Parkinson's disease and whenever my father visits me it takes a huge toll on me because his condition has been getting much worse over the years. I remember laying in bed all day and crying because of how hurtful that was. I emailed my professor and told her how upset that made me she gave me a sincere apology, but I truly don’t forgive her for that. It made me realize what kind of students are graduating from my program and I began starting to have a disdain towards them.

After that happened I completely stopped caring about my grades and basically passed all my summer classes with C-‘s. I began to become very impolite to my professors and classmates and I simply couldn’t muster the motivation to study and do well. When the Fall semester began I enrolled in a fulltime semester, It was my last year of college and I wanted to get the last of my course load finished so I could graduate and move on with my life. You get student loans when you enroll fulltime through FASFA but I didn’t receive the check I was waiting for, I needed that financial aid in order to pay my rent and textbooks/course materials. I called the financial aid office to figure out where my money was. And they didn’t bring it to my attention that I was over credit hours and can no longer receive financial aid thru FASFA. At that point I had 2 dollars in my bank account, and I was a month behind on my rent.

I had to max out my credit card to buy my textbooks and materials when I was already weeks behind in my classes because of that. At that point, the stress was too much to handle because I still had another semester left after this one and I had no idea how I’d be able to afford rent or food. My program was very rigorous and I had to do a lot of group projects and was half-assing all my work. I would tell people in my groups to fuck off and leave me alone when they would confront me about my lack of effort and I would simply tell them I just don’t care anymore. I ended up getting C’s and D’s last semester and then I was dismissed from my major. I was told the only way I could graduate now is by changing my major and staying in school an entire year and a half longer. When I found that out I attempted to kill myself.

I went to the school consoler and told her I wanted to take my life and she called the police and they Baker acted me, put me in a psych hospital against my will for 7 days. Luckily, I’m still in my college program but I can’t get a degree in Marketing and have to settle with the general Business degree which I’m very ashamed of. When the Spring semester started I enrolled in only one class, and I was doing well in the class at first, then, about a month into my semester I was arrested by a campus officer for skateboarding. He threatened me with physical violence said that he was “going to smash my face into the pavement” and even went out of his way to further intimidate me by taking his pepper spray out and pointing it in my face when I wasn’t resisting arrest whatsoever. He threw me in county jail, and I had to spend all the money I had saved up to pay for legal fees to get my charges dropped. It was so stressful dealing with that and for the past 3 months I’ve been dealing with trauma from that incident I re-live it everyday and have been experiencing reoccurring nightmares about it, I was able to pass that class with an S grade but it took all my effort to pass that class, I barely had any motivation to get out of bed at that point. Now because of the COVID epidemic I was laid off from my job I have no income now. My mother wants to help pay my rent but it makes me so ashamed because I’m almost 30 years old and I feel so useless having to resort to my mother paying my bills for me when she’s struggling to get by herself. I honestly don’t feel like I’m capable of accomplishing anything my whole life I’ve been told I’m too stupid and not good enough by the education system and the work force I feel like Im destined to be stuck working for 9 dollars an hour the rest of my life.

I recently just withdrew from three classes (12 units) even though the semester is almost over. I had almost no motivation for this semester since the beginning. I don’t want to blame it on anyone but after I was dumped I just didn’t care anymore even though I attended school everyday. With corona virus happening and things moving online - it became all too easy to just neglect my schoolwork.

I would like to take summer classes and retake the classes I dropped this semester. Is there any repercussions for dropping out with only a month of school left? Will my school automatically withdraw me from their enrollment even though I want to go back after I just focus on getting my head right? 

Fall semester starts up in August and I fully intended on retaking the classes I dropped. As I truly believe the only way for me to “make it” in life is to obtain a college degree.

EDIT: Also I currently have a 3.5 GPA. I’m not generally like this and can’t even fully explain the sudden lack of motivation this semester. I don’t blame it all on the breakup I experienced because that happened in January and spring semester started for me in February.",college,Dropping out when the semester is almost over.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ge47m9/dropping_out_when_the_semester_is_almost_over/,1588724606.0

780,idffle,1588221139,/r/college/comments/gap05x/uni_makes_me_feel_really_dumb_and_caged_in/,"So everything I'm about to say now, is stuff I've sort of realized through therapy and what I feel like my problems keep winding down to.

I'm going into my 4th year of my Physics degree and aside from my very first year, I've done absolutely awful. At first it was just my math courses that weren't going well, but now it's my physics courses too.

I had to ask my prof to push me up a percent so I could pass one of my courses after repeating a second time. I passed Quantum mechanics,l but if it weren't for the situation we're in now, I probably wouldn't have.

I know a lot of this has to do with my study habits but I just cannot study. I don't know why. I wasn't like this before though, I swear. Like now I feel like I'm a slacker, but I used to be really, really damn good at school and other stuff I did. Or at least I was until I switched high schools in grade 11 and had to find my place again.

I don't enjoy studying anymore. I don't know why. Just the thought of it makes me nauseous.

School makes me feel so caged in mentally, like I can't be free. I think one of the reasons why I loved school before was because of how much opportunity I had to be creative. Lots of projects that I could just let myself be free with which I no longer had when I switched schools because all we ever did were tests.

Doing tests and assignments over and over just feels so goddamn tiring. It's so redundant.

I don't know if that really plays into why I can't do well in school, or if that even is a reason why I can't do well or if it's something else, but I just need a break. I need stuff that isn't just tests and stuff.

And as bad as the current situation in the world has been, especially in terms of studying online. Online school has went MUCH better for me than in person lectures ever could.

Lectures are tiring for me too. So much more talking and listening and writing notes versus working with the material or being given the chance to figure things out for myself. Now with everything online, I can actually pause lectures and try to figure things out for myself and whatnot so that's helped a lot. All of this though, makes me feel really dumb. No one else I know or am friends with needs to be accommodated like this to do well in uni.

I just want to do well.

I don't really know where i'm going at with this but I guess it's just years of frustration built up and not being able to figure out what to change that is frustrating.

On top of that, when I try to motivate myself to do stuff, I end up mentally exhausted instead. I can get through something and then need to take a LONG break to recharge. I wish I wasn't like this. I wish I could go back to being the way I used to be with school.

I've worked at the school observatory for the last 3 years and I'm probably not even going to end up with a job after graduation because of how bad my marks are and how irrelevant my work experience is in terms of getting a proper job.

I initially went to school for physics + a concurrent degree in education, but I never wanted to do education. In fact, I gave up on my dream school for the school that provided this education degree solely because my mom was afraid of what I would be able to do with my physics degree alone.

I made a career changed, dropped my education degree this year and now I'm working towards what I want to do (SWE) but goddamnit I have nothing to show. Also, I loved physics (at least in first and second year) but thought I wouldn't enjoy programming until I actually did take up programming and realized I enjoyed it more than anything in my own degree. This is why I didnt go into it from the start.

I am trying to teach myself and work on side projects though, but I'll be going from a meh Canadian school and competing against people who've went to like UWaterloo, or Princeton or stuff for the same jobs and idk, I just feel really crappy all in all.",college,Uni makes me feel really dumb and caged in,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/gap05x/uni_makes_me_feel_really_dumb_and_caged_in/,1588239139.0

I had 103 credits at the time (75 transfer) but it was going to take me 160 credits to graduate AT MINIMUM since I switched from Digital Media Web Design to Interdisciplinary Studies about halfway. I truly hate the school I went to and have a long list of complaints, from the quality of the professors that were hired at the institution (surprisingly poor) to the literal fraud the school continues getting busted for (this is a public university btw).

The credits I got from this school don't transfer anywhere else. I've already checked. The school recently added a General Studies/Integrative Studies degree where it'll apply all of the credits I've earned so far towards a General Studies degree. If I returned, I could graduate in less than a year. However, I'm feeling iffy about the decision. I would like to get my Bachelor's just so I can say ""I paid for this garbage"" and I only have 30-something credits left if I go for this track. Plus, I can take the track online. But I'm also not thrilled about the prospect of going back to a school that has such a poor quality of education. I'd be losing my financial aid if I graduate and I wouldn't know exactly what to do with my degree outside of put it up on a wall.

A little background info: I dropped out of high school my senior year. I got my GED and started working at a sandwich shop soon after, working there for almost a year. I took an online class at my community college over the summer and then took one class on campus this past fall semester. I quit with the main reason being I wanted to go to school full time. I took a part time job at the same sandwich shop but a different location near my house. Long story short, I started working full time for this shop and got back into the management team. My hope was to become a general manger and eventual part owner, but once again I want to go to school full time instead. 

College background info: At the end of this semester, I will have 22 credits with a projected 3.0 GPA. If I retake one class over the summer and do well I would be at a 3.4 GPA. All come from my community college. Never took SAT or ACT.

I have been looking to go to a 4-year school, moving onto a campus and devoting all of my time to my education and extracurricular activities. I think my biggest struggle with the three classes I am taking now is that I work ten hour days the five days I do not have class, which is physically and mentally exhausting. I do not have any bills and live at home, so I could very easily leave this job. The questions I have now are:

* Those who have had a similar sort of 'gap year', how were you able to adjust to the transition? 
* I would rely on loans with little financial assistance from my parents, but how much spending money would I have to have saved up for books, parking passes, other activities etc..
* I am excited for the social aspect and clubs/sports/overall experience of university, but is it overwhelming? 
* Is going from working 50 hours a week to only having class/lab/homework as beneficial as it seems? I feel that I would have so much to study, be social, other activities. 
* Would I even get into a college? Do I need more credits, better GPA, test scores etc since I didn't graduate high school?",college,Leaving my full time job to go to university,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/g0c2tg/leaving_my_full_time_job_to_go_to_university/,1586770947.0
790,enormousgrizzly,1586616088,/r/college/comments/fz6llb/my_school_plans/,"Ok. So I originally wanted to go to a university but I could not figure out how to finish the payments so I decided to go to a 2-year college. Well that was going alright, I got done with my first semester in 2018 and did NOT do as well as I thought I would. I got C’s which is just mediocre for the supposed “easier” college work. There is your proof that a 2-year college is no easier than a 4-year university. I got a job for Work Study my second semester but I was too worried about dating if I am being honest, so I basically went to jail and had a mental breakdown and dropped out without cancelling any of my classes. Now I owe $300 and some book fees but I can pay that easily; I am back up on my feet now and taking care of it all.

My plan now is to pay that, take online summer classes (2nd semester), fall classes (3rd semester), Spring classes (4th semester) and then I an graduated. I will transfer over to a 4-year university and finish in fall 2022.

This is interesting, trust me. By taking summer and then fall classes for my junior year in 2021, then taking spring classes and fall or summer classes in 2022, I get my undergraduate 4-year degree. It is cool because, although I will not be completely lined up with my high school class, I will graduate the same year as them. It is also cool because I start two semesters at the beginning of the year instead of kn the Fall. I like that format better and it is like my own way of doing my own college experience, even if it is just the time I take my classes.

However, due to my lack of preparedness and not knowing what I wanted to study, I was overwhelmed by my studies and lacked motivation and concentration. Pre-Nursing was my main concentration during my freshman year at a four year university. I was not ready for the intensity and accelerating pace I had to go through with my prerequisites.

One thing for sure is that getting a higher education is on my mind, despite the costly tuition. I am already deep in five grand of student debt from the first year at university. Furthermore I am also risking in changing my major from Pre-Nursing to Computer Science. I already know that working in the healthcare may not be for me even though I feel like it's more rewarding. After lots of research into software engineering, I have decided that it's the field I would most likely see myself doing longterm. I am highly interested in building my skills and knowledge in technology.

After about my freshman year of high school, I pretty much scraped through to get a good scholarship because of my high standardized test scores and decent gpa.  Once I actually made it to college, I experienced some pretty severe depression and apathy.  

For the first 2 years of college I only earned 12 credit hours, from my first semester of my freshman year.  I managed to earn 6 more during a summer intercession. I had to withdraw from all other semesters, once because of a mental health crisis, then because I had to get a restraining order against an abusive ex, and the other because I would’ve failed everything otherwise.  

This semester, again, I withdrew from everything  except 2 classes.  I’m trying to stick with it; my school has gone pass/fail so I should manage to scrape by.  For my whole college experience, I have felt like more of an outside observer than an actual participant, even though I’m actually enrolled in classes.   It doesn’t feel real and like a priority to me somehow.  It doesn’t seem to matter very much at all.  If I can get these 6 credit hours, I will officially be a junior.  (I had a full year of credits coming to college.  AP classes, dual enrollment, etc). 

I did try to get involved my freshman year- joined a sorority, did the honors program, all that.  I just didn’t make friends or have fun.  I dropped that stuff after my first year.  Things have gotten a lot better for me socially since then, and I’ve made some good friends that go to my school.  But still I pretty much let this semester pass my by like all the rest- even before COVID-19 blew everything up.  I skipped classes and missed assignments, and just constantly felt one step behind.  I can never seem to stay on top of anything.  My dad has suggested that I may have some ADD issues, which he suffers from as well, but I have been evaluated by a couple psychiatrists who didn’t seem to think so.  How can I change my last year of college to not be like the rest?  My GPA is not beyond repair; I’m sitting at a 2.9.  I don’t know exactly what I want out of my future but I know I probably need a degree.  I’d like to keep a good enough GPA to keep the option of grad school open for me later should I want to go.  I have a lot of varied interests... sort of a Jack of all trades, master of none.  It makes me feel so indecisive, and I’ll go through phases of being extra-passionate toward one thing, and think I’ll want to commit to a path leading toward that goal, but then that passion eventually burns out, until it pops back up on my radar later- or maybe not at all.

I ended up not doing well in Bio 1 and dropped it in November so it wouldn’t hurt my GPA but i finished the lab. I feel like if i really tried at the end of the semester i might have been able to get better than a C- but i can’t change that now. Since i wanted to be a bio major all throughout high school i don’t want to give up on it so easily. However, dropping it has definitely affected my passion and confidence in the biology field. I am currently taking a psychology course and a stats course and took AP stats in high school. I am also going to be retaking Bio 1 over the summer at a community college. 
       Fall semester 2020 i will be taking Bio 3 and some other courses including psy and stats. The question is if I should take chemistry or not. I don’t have much interest in chemistry but it is a requirement for bio majors. with the lab it is 5 credits, so if i don’t take it I could take both another stats and another psy course. 
      The major dilemma here is that i just don’t really know what to do. I used to be passionate about biology but not really anymore and the lab assignments were always very hard for me. I don’t want to give up on it that easily but it was a pretty hard class for me and thinking about taking those labs again is not a good thought. However, the thought of giving up on my biology path because i was not smart enough or was too lazy is not good either. I don’t mind data science but i’m really only perusing it because i could get a good job in it not because i enjoy it.

I know the advice is always, ""Go to the department chair! Go to the professor's office hours!"" but I feel like a global pandemic shutdown and the fact that my professor is the department chair changes things.

First of all, my school is on the quarterly system, so our school only started Feb 24. We were barely a month in by the time classes were suspended. After the first week of school, I was dealing with medical issues (not COVID related) and stayed home until I could get two procedures done to fix things. I told all my professors right away when I couldn't attend class, and most of them have been so supportive and helpful.

Only one professor has been completely silent, and she happens to be the department chair for one of my majors. Since I have other classes with her and will have more classes with her, I was honest about what is going on with me. She didn't respond, but she emailed all classes and told us that she understands if we miss class due to Coronavirus fears. I took this to mean that my absence is excused, but I did have other concerns in the email I hoped I could talk to her about. I emailed her three more times since then with no response, my most recent email being this past Monday.

I'm also supposed to be TAing for another professor and all of this is under her supervision, and I can't TA anymore and I don't have that professor's contact info so I really need to talk to my professor about this.

I'm so overwhelmed by this semester, I feel so lost after missing the entire first month of the semester. I already dropped one of my classes (TA) with her due to the lack of communication and the fact that I feel very behind right now, but I'm about ready to drop this class with her as well. Should I talk to the school's disability office about this, even though it's technically not a disability? I'm not sure what resources they'd have. I'm also considering dropping anyway, my school is offing ""Excused Withdrawals"" and full refunds right now, even though this may affect my financial aid. I really don't want this affecting my financial aid, and I have an important class I'm taking the second half of the semester, otherwise I'd drop out this semester.

I've been admitted to two, and I'm expecting a couple more. However, I also have a learning disability and have been struggling *tremendously* with the Covid-19 closures. None of our disability resources are fully online yet, our tutoring center is closed, everything is in fucking shambles, and I've also become primary caretaker of my grandma while her normal person is with her kids. I have no income, my family might be homeless soon, and I'm doing my best to hold my shit together. 

Enter my professor. We'll call her Sue. While every other instructor on campus has been flexible and worked with me to develop some kind of agreement that allows us all to be happy and get the work done, Sue has been completely immovable in her rules. Attendance is strict, even though I live in a shitty part of town where the bandwidth is nonexistent (bc our infrastructure wasn't set up to do 800+ units of internet at once) and I can't always get a connection. For most of my instructors, the effort is enough. For her, it's her way or the highway. 

So, I got pissed and called her out. I was respectful and diplomatic, but I let her know that I had a schedule conflict during an assigned Zoom meeting time. She then threatened to take me to the dean. I'm already struggling enough, so to have that laid at my feet in addition to everything is just... Like, I can only do so much. So, I respectfully asked her to be more flexible. 

She flipped out, complained about how hard her job was, told me I was being rude and how dare I even suggest she wasn't being flexible (she wasn't; she wanted us to defy social distancing protocol to find three audience members for speeches, and only backed down when it was *mandated* by the government that we stay inside). I'm just tired. I'm younger than her by several years, but it feels like I'm the exasperated parent standing by while she screams herself blue. I'm DONE with this woman acting like this, and I know I'm not going to be able to perform my best if something doesn't change - and soon. 

If I withdraw from this class, I will need to stay a whole extra year at this school. It's the last class I need, so the CSUs and UCs would rescind my acceptances if I dropped it. If I don't drop it, I might fail because I'm just trying to keep my shit together and cope with my stupid learning disability through all this and here she is, making life a million times harder for her students. And when people ask her to be more considerate, she blows up at them. It's a horrible fucking environment.

I did do a single semester right after high school, but due to family issues I dropped out. I’m sick of job hopping and I have a better idea on what I want to do for the rest of my life. I will also be (hopefully) starting a community college. 

I don’t know how to go about paying for school. Can I just walk into a bank and ask for a school loan?? I’m struggling a bit financially so I would be 100% dependent on loans for right now. 

What about scholarships? Where do I even get started with those? Do they send the money straight to the school or to me?? 

Is it too late to do FAFSA? I want to start ASAP, or this fall 2020.

803,a_tulsa_wet_diaper,1584814018,/r/college/comments/fmj825/advice_from_a_senior_5_things_ive_learned_from/,"1. Get Involved-Unfortunately for me I didn’t get super heavily involved until junior and senior year because of very strong anxiety and depression. But my advice, no matter how shy you are, at least go to the club/intramural/volunteer once to see how you like it. Even if you don’t talk to anyone, people will know your face and eventually a more outgoing person will try to connect with you.


2. Relationships are everything-This is what I’ve learned most about life from college. Especially for business majors, you will benefit the most all around if you make friends with everyone you come in contact with. Friends in the dorms, classes, teachers, faculty.  This will not only make you feel better, but you will have so much more help with having fun on campus, homework, finding internships, and eventually getting hired. 


3. Daily Rules- Pick how much you are willing to study and then shape your life around that. For me, I hated doing work past 9pm, so I would stop work then and then rest until about 10:30pm when I would go to sleep.  This would make me procrastinate less during the daytime because I was working towards that relaxing time at the end of the day.  Additionally, you need to have a SOLID SLEEP SCHEDULE.  Even if you don’t get all your studying done every night 8+ hours of sleep will allow you to keep working the next day.


4. Have several outlets-Do something routinely that has nothing to do with school. Some of mine were, no schoolwork on Fridays, go to the gym 3 times a week, and go to my intramurals/clubs on their schedule days of the week. Even if you have a super challenging major, strategically you will do better when you allow your brain to organize itself and to prevent burnout.


5. Study Smarter- Since I’m a slow reader, reading textbooks and novels would be such a time sink for me. Therefore, I would only spend that much time doing it only if it was absolutely necessary. Many teachers tell you to do the reading, but their tests and quizzes are 90-100% based off the notes in class. So I would read the books until the first quiz, and then if it’s not based of the reading I would no longer read for that class. This gave me more time to do real studying for my harder classes, and not waste valuable study time on nonsense. 


Honorable Mentions:

Study Over Time- I know this is hard, but if you can look over your class notes briefly after class and maybe even make flash cards or whatever for them, it will be much easier when you relooking over everything the week before the test. 

Hygiene-Look good, smell good, feel good.  For me, I liked doing my laundry on my off day so that it doesn’t interfere with my school work. But some people liked doing it as a study break either way. On the other hand, (controversy warning) I’m not the type of person to look down on someone for wearing a shirt two times in a row because they needed to study for a test instead of do laundry/shower, just try not to get super gross if you can. 

Friend Groups- imo, friend groups are nice to be apart of, but don’t make them your only social contact. I did this my freshman year and got burned because my two best friends both dropped out and that kinda left me stranded. My advice is that if you’re in a group, be nice to them and always try to hang out, but kind of have your own secret side mission were you are looking for other opportunities to meet new people (clubs/sports). 

Feel free to ask my about other topics (campus jobs, scheduling classes, online vs in person, changing majors) but I feel like all of those topics are much more on a case by case basis.",college,Advice from a senior: 5 Things I’ve learned from College so far.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/fmj825/advice_from_a_senior_5_things_ive_learned_from/,1584832018.0

805,InquisitorLavellan,1584499489,/r/college/comments/fkibil/should_i_switch_schoolsmajors_when_im_close_to/,"Hey,

To make a long story short, fall semester this school year I failed all my classes due to a mix of serious, snowballing mental health issues along with my father having cancer. I know I should have been more proactive about taking action/reaching but I pretty much just shut down completely, I was and am so ashamed of needing help and being so pathetic, so I just kinda let things go. Most days I couldn't even get out of bed, unless it was to go to work or take my dad to appointments. Just as a note, before this I was a 3.7 student, regularly made Dean's list, tried so hard and I completely feel like I failed myself but I was just....not doing well and was just trying to survive. I haven't looked at my GPA since, I have been so scared and disappointed in myself.

This semester all my classes were dropped by admin, not me, without my approval or knowledge until after the fact, after I told them I was having surgery and would not be able to attend classes for two weeks. The thing is, I'm very close to graduation. If I had attended this semester I would have graduated this spring. I only have two more requirements to meet. The thing is, one of the classes that is MANDATORY for my one major is only offered in the spring, so if I go back I will have to wait a whole year to go back and graduate, just for that one class. 

However, after much consideration, I have decided that my two majors aren't actually things that I will pursue career wise after I graduate. I am majoring in English and History. The only reason I have not already switched schools is because I am so close to graduation, even if I m not actually going to use them. I instead have made up my mind to pursue psychology/counselling. So I have been looking into colleges for that, if I can even get in anywhere after having such a bad semester on my transcripts. I'm just wondering if I should wait the year and get my two degrees before starting on this new path. I really don't relish the thought of basically putting my whole life on hold for a year for something I'm not even going to use, but I also don't want to quit when I am SO close. I'm just at such a loss on what to do, so I thought I'd reach out and see what others thought.

Please be good to yourselves and each other--there are a lot of you suffering and confused here, and I encourage us all wherever possible to form online communities and to check in regularly. 

""*¡Hola Papi!*

*Obviously, the world is in shambles. One small side effect is that my university canceled classes for the rest of the semester, and our commencement will be canceled as well. I know I'm lucky that this is the biggest impact COVID-19 is having on my life, and that I'm privileged to have had a solid 3.67 years of college at all. But as a senior with no current plan for postgrad, I can't help but feel like I'm losing something important.* 

*This feeling isn't unique to me: everyone in my year is sad about losing the opportunity to say goodbye to friends, have that last mediocre hookup, etc. But I'm sentimental, and I endow otherwise meaningless symbols with undue meaning (I was a repressed kid, missed out on a lot of \~traditional milestones\~, etc.). At risk of sounding dramatic, it feels like an important chapter of my life isn't going to have an ending, that I'll feel stunted as a result, and that the memory of college will wind up tainted.* 

*And, okay, all of that sounds like nonsense even as I write it. Intellectually, I know I need to get to a place of gratitude, and I know that takes time. But how do I move on without feeling like I'm missing experiences that have shaped so many other people? Will it always feel like a loss?*

*Signed,*

*Varsity Blues*

Hey there, VB!

I just want to point out that hardly a sentence went by in this letter where you weren’t hedging or beating yourself up. I mean, you even preemptively dismissed these major life events as “meaningless symbols!” Who is asking you to be so hard on yourself here? It’s not me!

In fact, I’ll go ahead and say what you won’t: this shit sucks. I canceled a trip to see friends that I was very much looking forward to. It’s been beautiful outside (probably in no small part due to climate change, but, you know). I had plans for this period of my life that didn’t involve locking myself in my apartment and eating handfuls of frosted mini-wheats out of a box like a raccoon. 

But the thing is, VB, no one is asking that I be happy about it, or that I not be sad or disappointed. What’s being asked of me is that I be considerate of others and that I briefly inconvenience myself for the collective good. That’s called “sacrifice,” and by its very nature it is not fun. If sacrifice is ever fun for you, then congratulations. You probably just found a new kink. Mazel tov.

There’s something to be said, of course, about putting yourself in other’s shoes and gaining perspective. I mean, even when it comes to quarantine, I’m lucky. There are a lot of workers out there who are being told to physically show up or lose their job. Others have lost a huge chunk of income, and I seriously doubt our federal government is going to be looking out for them over, say, a corporation. 

And, yes, VB. People are dying. People are getting sick. Even people who survive could very well be put in a perilous economic position thanks to our draconian healthcare system. It’s definitely important to think about those people, and to consider them our teammates, in a way. We should look out for them, even if we’ve never met them.

However, just because there are *more* important things in the world doesn’t make your concerns and feelings unimportant. Graduation isn’t a frivolous thing! I mean, sure, it was for me. I didn’t go to mine. I didn’t want to sit down and do nothing for that long (and now look at me! BooBoo the Fool!), but it’s a big deal for many. You don’t have to explain that away. I get it. You have every right to be disappointed.

We tend to live our lives with the not unreasonable expectation that the world will keep it together, VB. Sure, ours is a turbulent planet, but on the whole we usually get away with keeping things moving. If we didn’t live that way, we would become apocalypse bunker people, who by the way are thriving at this very moment, but whatever. They deserve the occasional W. The point is: it’s normal to go about your life with some expectations. We need those.

And I think for a lot of people, myself included, we’re dealing with those expectations being very suddenly dropped to the floor. In another timeline, I’d be looking forward to eating tacos in Los Angeles this evening with people I like. In this one, I am looking forward to reheating the quarantine pasta I made last night which I will eat alone at my desk. You can’t guilt me into pretending that’s a good time.

Even if we’re lucky enough not to have any sick family members or not be immunocompromised or vulnerable ourselves, there’s still a lot of grief to go around that comes with the shattering of norms. I’m scared, VB! The routine I cling to has been snatched from me, and I’ve been given a sobering reminder of the precarity of the human condition: my hopes, my goals, my fake little life, all are contingent on so many fragile things not falling apart. It’s a lot to come to terms with. Most of us will need therapy about all this.

But still, in the end, VB, no. I don’t think this will taint your college experience, nor do I think it will always feel like a loss. The sting goes away, and these events tend to fold themselves back into life with time and become mere drinking stories. My advice? Lean into the strangeness of this occasion and do something memorable.

Maybe you and your friends can arrange a graduation party for when this all calms down, and in the meanwhile you can do a ceremony over video conference. Make your own graduation caps out of whatever is in your house or something. Get creative! Make it an even better story down the road. 

This isn’t a normal time, VB. You don’t have to act like it is, and you don’t have to feel guilty about being displeased with it. When “coronavirus” stops being the number one headline, there will still be other, no less violent maladies proliferating our world, and those might not even get any attention at all. I hope that this pandemic makes the rest of us more compassionate, caring people who are more willing to invest in each other’s wellbeing. I think that’s possible, and I *know* it’s possible that you will move on from this. 

Meanwhile, stay safe out there! Isolate! Don’t forget to wear nice clothes at home just to flex on yourself! And congratulations on making it through school! I wish I was literate.

They were egotistical immature girls who have way too many problems and rely on alcohol as a coping mechanism.

I’ll be graduating from CC with a AA for Physics and going straight into a physics major at the university. But the last time I took any class related to my major was fall 2018. At that point I finished all physics and math, so I only had GE left. My plan was to transfer to UC Santa Cruz for Fall 2019 and I did get accepted but things unfortunately changed. The next semester (spring 2019) my mental health deteriorated and I ended up dropping all my classes mid semester with W’s. I have always struggled with mental health issues and I have been seeing a psychologist since middle school, but I was truly at my lowest point. I was completely out for about 4 months. Once I started getting better, I decided to transfer to a state university in my city that required another semester at CC, which wasn’t a problem since I was planning on transferring for Fall 2020. So now I’m in my final semester at CC and I’m really nervous about transferring. I don’t feel as sharp as I was before I dropped my classes and I feel so distanced from physics in general. To be honest, I used to be extremely passionate about physics and going to UC Santa Cruz but after my decline in mental health it all went away and I haven’t felt the same since. Sometimes I just feel like I’m not passionate about anything anymore and I’m just hoping that once I transfer it will all come back to me. I’m also nervous about being the only female in my classes. At my CC, I was always one of the only females out a few in math classes and I felt very uncomfortable. It was similar in physics classes but I didn’t usually feel uncomfortable since I was so excited about it. So I’ve never had friends or people I could relate to that were females doing physics like me. I know for some it’s not a big deal but I think I struggle with the gender difference more than I admit.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the email, word for word (asterisks to hide the name of the school)

Dear Class,

You deserve an explanation for the sudden interruption in our class schedule.  First, however, I need to issue a trigger warning for the adult themes, especially rape, that will be discussed below.  If you think you would have difficulty being exposed to the topic of rape, stop reading now.

I have taken steps to have several students removed from class, and several other students have dropped the class as a result of an unfortunate incident that occurred after class on Monday.  The Chair of the History Department and the Dean of the College of Arts &amp; Sciences have approved these measures and concur with me that disciplinary action was warranted against these students.  So let me explain why.

On Monday after class, I walked out of our building and over to the Library.  A group of students from this class, all male, were standing in a circle talking in the square outside the Library.  As I was watching the student who was speaking, he yelled, loudly enough for me to hear from 30 feet away, “FUCK THAT BITCH,” referring to me.  The student has admitted saying this and admitted that he was referring to me.  The other students in the group laughed and offered other offensive comments of their own.  I went into the Library, did my errand, and came back out again shortly, and the group was still there.   I confronted the student with his own words, purposefully yelling loud enough for all the world to hear and for him to hear what those words sounded like.  I then reported the incident and requested that two of the students be removed from my class.  This has happened.

Now I want to explain my reaction to you.  All my life I have tried to draw attention to the problem of rape culture, and here, directed at me, was a prime example of rape culture in action.  Rape culture is defined as the culture within all-male enclaves that allows sexual violence against women to be perpetrated.  It is practiced by men who are rapists and men who are not rapists.  Men who are not rapists participate in rape culture by failing to stand up to men who rape women or who advocate the rape of women.  Yelling “FUCK THAT BITCH” is literally advocating that someone should rape me.  It is quintessentially misogynist.  Misogyny means the hatred of women.  So I was subjected to a misogynist attack by one of my students calling for my rape, and four other students of mine laughed and encouraged the student who said this, and even further insulted me, all in public.  Men who do not have the courage to stand up and call out rape language are just as guilty as those who utter it.

You may think, as these students did, that I deserved this verbal attack because I am a terrible teacher and an awful person.  That’s fine if you hate me or my class, but egging on someone who is threatening to rape me is not the answer.  As a senior faculty member at \*\*\*, and in fact, the senior female professor in the History Department, as a 35-year veteran of college teaching, as the author of an award-winning book, and as a decent, contributing member of society and a leader in my church, I did not deserve to be subjected to this verbal assault in public, no matter how bad a student thinks the class is.  The administration agrees with me that such thuggish behavior is not appropriate for \*\*\* students.

Rape culture is an insidious factor in perpetuating violence against women in our culture.  This is a serious problem that men have to solve, since it is men who commit violence against women.  You may know the statistics that 2 out of 5 women are raped sometime during their college experience.  When I was your age, I was one of those women who was raped.  You may be one of those women, and if you are, I am with you, sister, and you will survive and thrive.  But focusing on the victims is not enough.  If 2 out of 5 women are raped in college, then it stands to reason that 2 out of 5 college men are rapists.  So statistically, out of that group of five men, two of them would be rapists.  Which of those men, confronted with a woman in a position of authority who does something he does not like, would think to himself, “FUCK THAT BITCH”?  Which of those men, confronted with a weaker woman who turned him down, would go on to rape her, to actually FUCK THAT BITCH?  Rape culture continues, and so does rape, because men perpetuate it and fail to stand up to the men who do it.

Studies have focused upon “men’s groups” as particularly susceptible to rape culture.  When men gather alone, without any women, they tend to egg each other on to do things they would not do if even one woman were present in their group.  Men tend not to yell “FUCK THAT BITCH” in the company of women they want to impress, but they will go along with it to impress other men or to avoid derision from other men.  Even speech uttered by someone with no intention of rape, however, can incite real violence.  Imagine a group of drunken men at a party, for instance, and one of them says that a certain woman rejected his advances, and another says “FUCK THAT BITCH,” and then another says, “I’ve got something to put in her drink, and then we can all fuck her.”  That’s rape culture at its worst.  Men encouraging other men to commit rape, and men who would never commit rape just going along to get along with their peers, contribute to the problem by not standing against it.  It happens all the time.  Every year we hear about it happening here at \*\*\*.

Rape culture and misogyny are systemic and structural because men will not stop it.  Culture conditions us to think, “boys will be boys,” and to let white males off the hook for such behavior.  This is how rape culture and misogyny continue, and why the situation is hardly much better for the women of today than it was for me when I was your age. Sometimes women even excuse this behavior.  History is littered with examples of *group think* just like that, of men and sometimes women egging on outrageous behavior, of people screaming “LYNCH THE NIGGER!” “KILL THE FAG!” “SLAUGHTER THE JEWS!” and no one takes a stand to stop it.  Presumably, you understand the gravity of all of these incitements to violence.  You should also understand why it would always be inappropriate to say or to cheer anyone who says “FUCK THAT BITCH.’

Or you could continue to indulge in such hatred.  You would not be alone in this world.  A misogynist sits in the White House.  The threat of rape is used daily by trolls on social media.  Women are still subjected to sexual harassment in the workplace.  Women have been talking about these issues for a long time, and still violence against women persists.  I do not see this as the fault of women.  Yet, the women who bring the issue into the light of day, as I am doing, will become the focus of blame and hatred, rather than the men who speak the violent words.  Trust me, I have seen this play out time and time again.

I am both heartbroken and outraged to have discovered such deep misogyny in some \*\*\* students.

814,dragoono,1582759647,/r/college/comments/fa2hyz/is_this_realistic_or_am_i_just_daydreaming/,"I dropped out of high-school after freshman year. It was ultimately a bad move, but I'm on track with getting my GED right now. I plan on graduating with my GED by June of this year (2020).

My plan is to get my GED, work until I buy a van and have around \~$4000 saved up, then quit my job so I have more time+energy for college. I want to go to a local university, and get a bachelor of science with a focus on pre-veterinary studies. I'll qualify for a hefty pell grant, and with that I plan on paying next to nothing for tuition. After I graduate, I want to move a state over, they have a qualified program to become a veterinarian. This is when I'll take out a loan to afford college, I imagine $20-$30k. I plan on working at McDonald's. This will pay me $9.65/hr 20 hours a week.

Here's what I have figured out:

Paycheck- $686/month

Car insurance- $183/month

Gas- $130/month

Gym membership- $25/month

PO box- $50/month

Food- $150/month

Laundry- $45/month

Total- $583/month

Am I insane or would this work out? As long as I follow my budget, I have a little extra money to throw in savings every paycheck. This would help out if my van needs repairs, or for buying other things (band-aids, shower stuff, toothpaste, whatever).

I want to be a veterinarian so bad. I would love to work with animals, and I wouldn't have to worry about my paycheck because the lowest paid 10% of vets make $50k a year. There's all kinds of loan repayment programs for veterinarians/science majors I could apply for, to maybe lighten the load on that front. If I wanted to get extreme, I could join the military and they would cover it all. But I would rather avoid that if I can.

815,cheffrog,1582694989,/r/college/comments/f9oe9v/my_college_experience_so_far_has_been_rough_tw/,"This is my first post on this sub! I just wanted to share my story and experience with college. Just because maybe someone out there relates with me or someone has been through it and has advice.

So I am a biology major at a research University in the Eastern US. This was the only school I got in to. I had like a 3.1 in high school and didn't try very hard. I had a rough family life during junior and senior year, right when the material picked up in difficulty.

I successfully completed my first freshman year in college with a 3.8 This was a HUGE win for me as I have always thought of myself as incapable and stupid. It was easily the best year of my life.

Sophomore year came around and I fell into a deep depression fall semester which caused me to be in the hospital twice and resulted in my first suicide attempt. I still completed the semester but received all C's. 

The next year. I was suicidal again during fall semester and ended up failing 2 classes. My gpa dropped to a 2.9. so I decided to take a semester off, thinking things would be better. 

After the semester off, I went back to school Fall 2019. I had ANOTHER suicide attempt (did not end up in the hospital) and ended up medically withdrawing from all classes.

This seems to happen every fall. I am honestly terrified to go back to school bc I'm afraid this will happen again. I'm just currently working as a line cook in a restaurant. It just feels like my goals as a future scientist are SO unattainable. I plan to go back spring 2021. Skipping fall this time, since that's when it seems to happen.

Maybe someone out there feels my situation. Depression in college is terribly common. The psychiatrist in the ER after my first attempt told me he sees students like me come in all the time.. he told me grades were not everything and that I can thrive in this world without an amazing GPA. I still have trouble taking his advice now. It's hard.",college,"My college experience so far, has been rough.

816,HastTagLavishLust,1582570213,/r/college/comments/f8vyyk/need_advice_professor_torturing_me_caught_cheating/," Before I start this I want to say that this professor isn't necessarily ""wrong"" in his methods, but he is taking them too extremely and being very unpredictable. I don't want to ""complain"" about him because the truth is I fucked up and deserve SOME punishment, but not what he is doing.

Last semester we where given a blisteringly painful final exam, I want to emphasis I DIDN'T CHEAT. However many people did.

During this exam, my friends and I where goofing around. Although against the rules we where whispering ""Fuck me man this exam is impossible"" ""Do you know ANYTHING on this fucking thing"" etc... HOWEVER we didn't share any help. All of us royally FUCKED the exam in our own ways, I'm talking 10-20% on the exam with all of us having completely different answer and methods.

Well what happened was that I went to talk with the professor about the exam at a later time, he dropped some cryptic shit saying I shouldn't worry about the results because something bigger is coming my way. I was confused as hell because I totally forgot about the talking and he said that a BUNCH of people got caught cheating with solid evidence, and that me and the people I where sitting with got reported for talking; he said he will get everyone expelled. I was scared shitless so I just pretty much ignored all of this, thanked him for his time and left.

I basically mentally broke down over the break scared shitless, but I never got any email from the university.

Anyway next semester starts and I have the same professor, everything is quiet for at least 2-3 months. I'm just trying to stay out of his way but he is always coming around me when I'm doing my experiment and just staying there staring at me for a while being creepy as shit. I'm literally mentally breaking down every day.

Finally one day RIGHT before our experiment (which is like 4 hours long; unnecessarily torturing us because he could have said it towards the end) he comes and says ""After your experiment is done you and your friend need to come see me in my office).

We go to his office and he basically says knows we where talking and this was his way of punishing us by letting us mentally fuck ourselves. We both admitted that we talked but it didn't help us, and he said based on the exam he believes us. I made the same mistake on the final as I did on a quiz which we had previously, my friend also did the same shit he did on the quiz as on the final. And both where wrong as fuck.

He said that the university is aware of the massive cheatings that took place and wants to fuck everyone but he said that he is going to protect us by not cooperating. He also said that my performance is poor for the experimental write ups but he is willing to let me redo them because he believes the pressure was getting to me. He told me to give him a week or two to write notes on all of them and then he said he will give me a week to fix them... So he seems like he is a good guy.

I give him the time and first thing in the morning on Monday I go to him enthusiastically and ask him if I can improve my write ups. I'm still thinking everything is dealt with and we can move on.

He asks ""why? these are so bad I don't think you should get a second chance."", as if he changed his mind and wants to fuck us again. I told him that I really want to improve, I have nothing else in my life except engineering, this is what I want to do with the rest of my life and I want to succeed. He finally gives it all back and says ""I expect all of these to be better, if you make another mistake I'm going to expel you."". I think fine, fair enough and take the papers back.

Here is the issue, he is nitpicking EVERYTHING. Even though the bulk of the report is good, he is taking away like 50%'s per section for simple things like a grammar mistake here and there. Or because he doesn't like the words I used. He is writing things like ""I can't even follow instructions"" for my formatting which is BULLSHIT. He posted 2 guides for writing a formal report, and both of them had a different structure. I followed guide 1 and he fucked me saying I didn't follow proper structure and he attached guide 2 to the report back.

I don't know what to do, this professor is so unpredictable and changes his mind so often its impossible to know his intentions. Half of me feels like this is his way of teaching but half of me thinks he is trying to torture us. Even during the class he was always telling students shit like ""If you do better on this I'll change this grade, if you do this I'll do this etc etc"" which he always just randomly kept his word to.

I'm fucking scared as hell, I feel like right now I have to please him in order for him not to fuck me for a dumb ass mistake I did during his exam. But nothing is pleasing enough for him. I feel like he is straight manipulating me and fucking with me for his enjoyment, I made a mistake but I shouldn't suffer this much. I'm scared that even after these improvements on my reports he will still decide to fuck me because it still won't be good enough.

The thing that pisses me off the most is I know for a FACT that at least a quarter of the class cheated, this being AT LEAST 12/40 people. I know this because I'm social and these people admitted it to me and even showed me how they will do it before the exam, they gloated about how well they did and got away with it. These people never had ANY repercussions because they weren't reported or caught red handed. When I told him there where more cheaters than he thinks he told me he doesn't care and to drop it. He even said ""What are you saying, are you saying people where on their phone during the exam and I can't see, are you saying I'm blind?"". He told me that only 3 where caught red handed and he doesn't care about the others. Which doesn't make fucking sense.

I don't know what to do, and I also don't want to talk to any dean or some shit. Right now I feel ""some"" level of safety, however I feel like if I talk to a higher up I'm only going to shoot myself in the foot.

I feel so helpless and vulnerable to this guy fucking me in the ass. Everyone is getting good marks on their reports even though they pretty much copied mine, he is only fucking with me. In the best case scenario I deal with his bullshit and keep my mouth shut and he royally fucks my grade to the point where I might have academic discipline. Worst case scenario is I suffer through this and he fucks me anyway. IDK what to do. Can anyone share some advice or something...

I've been contemplating going to the dean and telling him everything, but I don't know how he would react. He could help me and be understanding but he could also take the teachers side and expel me for talking during the exam. I feel so fucking trapped and I'm getting so depressed and its literally ruining my life right now. This school is all I have, I have nothing else. I fucked up but I don't think I deserve to have everything taken away for literally saying ""Fuck me this exam is hard, was this even part of the course material"".",college,"Need advice, professor torturing me.

It was my parents dream and for the longest time I thought it was mine too. I went to college straight after high school and my first semester I got okay grades. Second semester shit hit the fan. Someone close to me committed suicide and my mental health kind of deteriorated after that. I pushed all my friends away worked non stop at my part time job took as many shifts as I possibly could. There was not a moment where I wasn’t either in class or working. I had no one at the end of spring semester, my grades were really bad and I couldn’t do it so I just dropped out.

Hey everyone,
This is my first post on reddit. I was a little nervous at posting since I feel like everyone is going to think I’m exaggerating and ungrateful but here it goes. Background info: I’m currently a junior in highschool. I’m a female, Hispanic, and come from a low-income family. I’ll be the first one in my family to graduate from college. I’ve always loved school. Ever since I was little I knew I wanted to go into a very good college and help my family.  I did well for most of my school life. I was accepted into a  middle school that helped low-income girls in getting into the best high schools in the state. The middle school had a rigorous curriculum and most girls dropped out because they couldn’t handle the pressure. The school was from 8 to 5 PM. However, I survived and graduated with mostly  A’s and very few B’s. I was accepted into my first choice highschool in which I received financial aid of over $45,000 plus books and transportation to school. The school is 40 minutes away which means I have to wake up very early in order to reach my bus stop. If I miss the bus I can’t go to school, which was already happened once. I’m back at home by 6:40 PM. Currently I am doing so bad at the school, and have a GPA of less that 85%. I won’t be surprised if I’m at the bottom 20% in my school. My school has honors and AP classes, however if you want to take honors or AP, you have to apply. I have applied many times to honors and AP classes but i have never been accepted into one which is embarrassing when everyone around you has taken at least one honors class except you. It took me a long time to make friends  and even then i feel lonely. I wasted my entire freshman and sophomore year by myself studying for tests just to get a B-. I told myself that making friends is a waste of time, and to use that time to study. I took the SATs and ACTs in the fall and my stats were horrible compared to everyone in my school. I got a 1120 in the SAT and a 24 on the ACT. One of my dream schools was Uchicago, yet my college counselor said that i could never have a chance in getting in. It just  hurts SO MUCH to know that you worked so hard at school since the age of 10 just to know you’ll never have a chance in getting into your dream college . I have no friends now,  and i feel like I I wasted my childhood. I’m miserable. I have cried so much. I hate waking to school at 6 in the morning. I hate being in the bus for more than an hour. I hate having to be at home by 6:40PM wanting to relax only to know that I still have homework to do, and have to study for AT LEAST one test once a week. I hate my grades. I hate being the poor, ugly, outcast in my school. I just hate...everything. I regret applying to this school. Dropping out of an amazing  private school and going to my public school isn’t an option to me  because many people that I know will humiliate me for it and I just can’t throw away $45,000 in the trash. Everyone believes that I’m smart enough to go to a top 20 college but I know I’ll never meet their expectations. The only thing working in my favor is affirmative action (I don’t want a college to accept me just because I’m Hispanic), my extracurricular activities, and the fact that Im taking two languages at school. The only excuse for my bad grades is that  something  occurred in my sophomore year but that’s about it. Currently I’m  studying for the SAT and ACT to raise my scores at least by a few points. I honestly just want to graduate high school by this point.  If I express these feelings in real life people are gonna believe that I’m ungrateful. I want my childhood back.

I take 2 site based classes, 1 online class, and the other is an ‘academy’ class with my job that gives me 3 units in credit at the university. I get paid to take the class essentially! It’s pretty awesome. 

The issue I’ve been having is that I don’t know what it is I want to major in anymore. I haven’t known for a while which can be said is pretty dumb of me. Or really dumb.... Sure I have my associates degree in criminology, but I can’t major in Crim anymore due to a medical issue that will impact medical/health exams. It’s neurological and it’s not like it’ll go away in a day. 

I’ve had the hardest time trying to figure out what to do. I’ve taken exams and such but I can’t come to a conclusion on what it is I should pursue my BA in. It’s currently still sitting at Criminology. 

Yeah I’m actually seeking counseling and hopefully I can figure it out soon I guess. I’m probably wasting my time right now anyways. 

Here are the facts as of now. 

I got offered a full time job... in another state. Colorado to be exact. It has benefits and such since it’s federal employment. And I will be making like 3-4 times more than I make now. My schedule will allow me to have mornings free since I wouldn’t work until the afternoon. 

The job is supposed to start sometime next month. And it would be pretty great since I have a lot of debt I could pay off. But it would require me dropping out of the semester and transferring to a university closer to where I’ll be living/working in CO. Which could give me time to figure myself out more before I start school again. 

The thing I don’t entirely know is if I would even be admitted to a university out there if I drop out here. It wouldn’t look good that I just dropped a bunch of classes and moved somewhere. Or at least I don’t know? 

I rely on student loans to pay for my tuition and would need to amend my FAFSA for a university out there. And I’d need to repay the loans as soon as I drop the classes as well as a grant I received. 

I was hoping someone who’s had some sort of experience moving to a new state in the middle of the semester. How a transition like that went? 

I know that all universities vary. They have their own rules of admission and such. I have been getting contact info for both universities and I’ve let my instructors know that I’m debating on possibly leaving. 

I’m not set on leaving. I am really tempted to take the job and kinda just give myself time to figure it out. But I can’t make a dumb decision either. I’m on medicine for my neuro issue and I can get a few months worth of refills covered for when I leave. 

But I still have my education very much in mind. So it’s not set. 

Reasons for me not leaving is I have a good rewarding job in a state I know more. I’d be saving time by not moving away and moving out paperwork. I have family nearby I guess. I have a place with good roommates and I’m paying in state tuition which is a big plus. 

If I moved out to Colorado. How long would it be until I could qualify for instate tuition if that’s a factor?

It was always something that seemed so great, an unreachable dream that scared me because I came from a lower middle class family and I would become a first generation student, which excited me. High school I did everything possible to be the perfect applicant for college. I took AP classes and extra curriculars in Art and volunteering. I got good grades and I never procrastinated on homework or finals. 

But then my major interest changed, art school seemed like a copout and all I wanted was to pursue Spanish but out of state. I panicked once I changed my major, because I decided to change three months before graduation and decided to take a gap year. And I felt like shit for making that decision. I felt like such a failure because I saw everyone in my grade go to college and I hadn't decided. 

I finally applied to 6 dream schools in January but the anticipation is killing me. I want to go to college so bad but if none of them accept me, I think the only option I feel is the best is to kill myself. And I have no one to share that with. No one gets it because my family dropped out by senior year, my friends are either in college or left me my senior year because things were changing and no one stays the same once graduation comes. And my boyfriend... He's two years younger than me. I love him to pieces but he doesn't understand the importance of college. The only reason he's even looking at college is because his mom wants him to go and whatever his ma says... Goes. I think sometimes I get upset about that too. I shouldn't but, he doesn't even want to go to college and people are helping him. My parents never helped me because they didn't have the money or because it was my choice which means I don't get help with college search or college tours. 

I'm sorry. I needed a place to rant but I don't know. Maybe this will be my only engraving of my feelings. If 0 or 6 colleges accept me, I have nothing left. I will prove everyone right that I'm just a failure. My parents. My boyfriends parents who have shamed me in the past for taking a gap year. My friends who think college is a scam and dont understand why I want to go so bad, but if I don't go then I prove that theory right. And my boyfriend, who has supported me through it all... But deep down I think he'd be disappointed in me too. So I guess here it is. By mid March. Early April. I get my results. And my fate. And I just wanted somewhere to rant...

However, I am a ball of anxiety and would like some answers. I don’t need to know specifics, just in general what is going to happen. 

I took out a federal student loan, and that loan was dispersed in full for the semester already. So I’m confused as to what will happen with that.

When I finally have enough credits to transfer, will that C be frowned upon? I feel like political science has nothing to do with the major I'm going for which is editor and creative writing. I don't ever plan to touch politics again for any classes since it's not a requirement for my AA-T general. If it is frowned upon, should I try to retake it a third time? I feel like I will still only get a D or C, no matter how much studying I did. (the teacher's essay questions were vague, but was online so i couldn't ask what the questions meant).

So I did that with this course and I finished all the videos and started on my homework last week and all’s been going well until yesterday. I wasn’t able to access my course and thought it was some sort of bug and waited until today to try again. So I go and see I still can’t access it but my composition professor told me today he emailed me on my school email and I told him I didn’t know how to access it and he showed me and today I got on my email for the very first time and seen there were emails from my math professor saying I didn’t turn in any homework week one and week two and those count for our attendance. I scroll down some more and see 2 absences will result in being dropped from the course. It was very irresponsible for me not taking the time to figure out my email from the start but I just don’t want this to effect me in the long run or delay my expected graduation date and need advice on what to do about this.

So by the looks of it, I’m more or not fucked when it comes to going to a decent university. Personally, I wanted to go to a small private college.

No GPA, no EC, no LOR, etc. CC just seems to be my only choice in a way or am I being too defeatist? Should I try to apply for a university at least? Lots of people say that they were accepted to a great university with a GED and good SAT/ACT score. Sure it’s mostly anecdotal, but you get what I’m saying.

I hear that CC is great because it’s open to everyone, and it saves me money (lots of it). Just take two years of Gen Ed and a uni we go! It seems like CC is utopia on Reddit.

I’ve read a lot of stuff about CC here that aren’t too kind. It’s High school 2.0, the professors don’t care about you, the advisors lied about all of your credits transferring to a uni, the education is shit (you get what you paid for), there is no community or comradely (just people who come and go), it’s not safe, that kinda thing. From my experience, I’ve taken GED classes in the same building as the CC and the classes were awful. It did felt like high school 2.0. The classes were huge and cramped, everyone kept talking over the teachers non stop, there were fights, etc. It felt worse than high school and I dropped out of HS. I don’t know if that is any indication of what CC is going to be about.

Honestly, it depresses me. I was hoping to go to a university to escape my dysfunctional family and not be trapped at home depressed. It just looks like another shitty obstacle. 

I’m sorry for complaining and acting like a victim. I’ve been depressed all of my life, and there is always fighting going on in my family so I don’t get any space. I’m on my own. I have no tutor, or anyone to help me and I don’t wanna fuck my life up any further. It’s been so hard especially these last few years. Just thinking about my future is distracting me from what I have do now. I haven’t slept well in weeks.

I have a professor that does not teach jack shit. ~160 kids in this class, there's only 2 TAs and 1 prof. The purpose of this class is to do all the work on your own outside of class, then show up for questions. How the fuck am I supposed to ask questions if there's 159 other kids raising their hands asking questions? I swear to fuck I spend the entire class with my hand raised waiting for a TA to show up. I send emails and they don't get answered. The best resource is other students. 

I have another prof, she is the ONLY professor who teaches a specific class which is required for my degree. There is no other option. I had an online (auto graded) assignment marked wrong, I sent her proof that I was right, and I didn't get a reply. I come into class *6 fucking days later* and confront her, and I asked ""did you receive my email or did I send it to the wrong person?"" and she says she got it but didn't read it. Well okay, a day or two or 3 is understandable. A fucking *week* later and still no reply (and no reply to this day, 10 days later) is fucking absurd. My grade still hasn't changed.

I had another professor 2 semesters ago (spring 2019), and once again, I got an answer marked wrong that was correct. Emailed this lady and she replied standing by her typo and told me tough shit, you still got it wrong. This is for a programming quiz (data structures). A typo is the difference between right at wrong. ""quizBank"" is NOT the same as ""quziBank"", those are 2 completely fucking separate variables. She ignored all further emails, which I made very polite because my grade is in this woman's hands. This lady did not do anything at all except 1 quiz a week based on zybooks. The midterm and final were proctored, not by the school, so we had to pay out of pocket to take our fucking exams. $60 I wasn't expecting to pay, which isn't too bad, but why the fuck do I have to pay for that? There's no resources on campus for proctored exams? Fucking seriously? I can say I learned absolutely nothing at all about data structures but still somehow got a B. Fuck you [removed], you're fucking lazy and absolutely useless. Google her and check out that fantastic rate my professor rating. Edit I changed my mind on putting her name.

Financial aid. I met with a financial aid bursar lady fall 2018 who was reluctantly helpful. She sighed and sounded annoyed that she found me a $500/semester grant. Great! Any little bit helps, thank you! I only got this grant for 1 year. Last year, spring 2019, I went to meet with her only to find out she doesn't meet with students anymore. Neither does anyone in financial aid. Their whole office was relocated to another building. So I go and find out *other STUDENTS* are now handling finances. Fantastic, what's better than a barely paid 19 year old handling my finances? Them bullshitting every fucking question I ask them. They don't know the fucking answers. I call them out and say it's okay to say you don't know something, but don't fucking spread misinformation, especially on something that cost me $1000 a year and other students thousands as well. Fuck you. Now that grant I had is seemingly ""lost"", I can't meet with anyone over the age of 20, and I'm genuinely fucking annoyed. Some of these kids want to be helpful, but it's like they're trained to tell you whatever answer comes off the top of their fucking head at that moment. ""hmmmm *I think* it's because -blahblahbullshitanswer-."" I've almost had to drop out on multiple occasions due to a lack of money. I got denied every federal and private loan. I applied for around 6 private loan companies. Federal is determined by the financial aid office, except parent plus which I was denied on with both my parents. My credit is great, 730, I've had an auto loan for $35k and I paid it off entirely (and my credit dropped because now my average age of credit is lower lmfao) and apparently that doesn't mean shit. My parents have $300,000 and $40,000 in student loans for my sister's private college loans, so I can't get money, my younger brother went to the military because he can't get help and had no money of his own, and now my younger sister who's still in HS doesn't believe me when I say she has to work, make money like I did, and pay your own way through college as you go. There is no money or loans that will magically appear. Just as you scrape by to pay the tuition by the due date, you're fucked in the ass with $400 in access codes and out of pocket housing / food costs. 

Back to access codes. Nearly every professor requires zybooks, Pearson mylab, wiley plus, or some other dog shit software that the students are required to pay for. Why are we paying the university and then paying a 3rd party to do our homework? These companies are determining the fucking prices. If the prof says ""we're using zybooks, this is the code"", there is *No. Other. Choice*. You are forced to pay whatever zybooks/pearson/wiley/whoever says you gotta pay. $60? $90? $120?? Pay it or fail. Textbooks are no longer as widely used because kids pirate them because they're charging $200 for a fucking textbook. What is the fucking incentive for these professors to be using this software? Zybooks is absolute shit. Complete one section, get to the next, and all the answers from last section are gone. There's no penalty for getting anything wrong. There is no learning going on here. It's only useful for information, but it even fucking sucks at that because it doesn't go in depth on anything.

I do dual enrollment in highschool so I'm out of the required hours amount thing, so I don't have to live on camp. However, my parents reallyyy want me to, though my dad told me he could understand if I gave a good explanation. 

I'm definitely curious, but I'm worried. I think it could be a good way to finally get my stuff together for real life and have less home distractions. But I'm concerned I'll hate it, since I'll be at school ALL THE TIME. Literally. I've been going to college for the past 2 years, so I know it's so much different from highschool. But in my sophomore highschool year before I started dual enrollment, I was hating school. I had the normal schedule where I went to school from 7am-2:30pm then didn't get home till 4, so basically my life was ""School, homework, sleep"". I started skipping, my grades dropped, I felt super depressed, angry, and trapped. I was begging my mom to let me be homeschooled. I hated that my life was just school, school, school. When I started dual enrollment, I had half days and I finally felt like I had a balanced school and home life. 

I'm worried in a dorm I'll feel like I'm trapped at school again and I'll start skipping classes, get super depressed, and start getting bad grades again. I also tend to act impulsively when I get in moments like these and I'm literally afraid I'll drop out mid semester.

So there's no getting out of the feeling of not being in college, and I don't think I'll feel comfortable or even be able to sleep right. 

I feel like I'm crazy, and that this is such a weird thing but I'm actually concerned. I'm trying to weigh the pros and cons now.

What's your dorm experience like? Does it ""feel"" like living at school? Do you feel like you're constantly at school with no real life? I really don't want to get there and feel trapped, then things will go downhill quickly and I would have just wasted a bunch of money. 

Not to mention I will save a ton of money by not having to pay the housing and food pass costs, which are oddly expensive for this school.

Well, that was red flag number one. Being the naive freshmen that I was, I thought it was normal for professors to be a couple days late. I also didn't sense trouble when in the first syllabus my prof put up, he had a lengthy paragraph explaining that he was still a student and was a new professor who has never instructed an online course before. 

But, then, two days later, after I'd submitted all of the assignments that I was told to do that week, my prof posted another syllabus, replacing the old one, explaining that he was building the course as we went along and he decided that instead of the assignments I'd already completed, we'd do something else, and get the grades for those assignments Monday morning. So, I got those assignments turned in too. 

Come Monday morning, there were no grades to be found, and then there was a third syllabus that replaced the other two. I read through it, and it was basically the same shit. New prof. Unfamiliar with the course. Try this for a change. Etc. 

I started to get really worried, and began having daily panic attacks because of the constant change in the course, and reached out to my parents and therapist asking if this was normal. My parents graduated college in the late 1990s/early 2000's. They didn't attend any online courses. So, they had no idea. My therapist, however, was a professor before she decided to use her psychology PhD to help people. My therapist told me that was very abnormal, and suggested that if things didn't improve, to drop the class. 

So, I got home, checked the course, noticed that there was a fourth syllabus posted, and decided I was done. I let my parents know what I was doing, and dropped out this afternoon, with a day to spare before refunds were cut off. 

I honestly feel like shit. I keep thinking if I just stuck with the class, I would've done just fine. The assignments weren't very hard. It was just the lack of consistency and my anxiety that got in the way. Everyone I've told about this has told me not to be so hard on myself, but I can't help it. I'm in therapy trying to bring my anxiety to heel, and develop a more positive and merciful attitude towards life and myself. But, at the moment, I feel just like a total loser. 

All of my relatives went to college. All of my friends went to college, or are in college right now. Many of those friends were/are college professors. Hell, one friend is even a dean of a medical school. Yet, here I am, 18 years old, not doing much other than working on keeping my health above water (I have Cystic Fibrosis, so that shit's kinda serious, and it turns out my anxiety is largely genetic), and I feel like garbage for not being able to keep up with a single online course in writing, which is something I'm good at and really enjoy doing. I worked so hard and tried so many things to successfully graduate high school on time, despite multiple near-death-experiences caused by CF. I did it, and I took the fall semester off with the plan of starting college after Christmas, so I could begin working towards getting my associate's degree. 

But, that obviously didn't work out. I was doing so well until now, and to say I feel defeated is an understatement. 

I know it's not a race. If it was, I'd be well ahead of the game considering my health and circumstances. But, I am extremely competitive. Everything to me is a potential competition. I'm aware that is a very toxic and detrimental mindset, and I am trying to break it. It's just extremely difficult, especially when I look around and see just how successful everyone else has been compared to myself, even though nobody else was born into suffering like I was. Thankfully, those people have tried to assure me that dropping out was the best idea, and a few of them have humorously told me they would've given me a boot to the head if I stuck with that course long enough to pay a thousand bucks to fail.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a young adult attending university perusing a degree in computer science. Getting a job in this field in any aspect has been my dream since sixth grade. I taught myself programming throughout middle and high school and consider myself advanced when it comes to my skill level. I've worked on several projects which have all been released for free (No need to make money off of these... I was only a high school student living with his parents) and have worked on several other projects. I won't get too much further into this, but to put it short I know what I'm doing.

I say all this because I have to ask: Is this really what I have to do? Is it worth everything I'm having to go through? I've been in university for several semesters and the stress is *literally* killing me*.* From having to deal with professors who have zero care about my schedule and free time, a high school which continually fucks up my records, FASFA issues, strained relationships, and other issues my mental health has taken a hit, it was already in a bad place but this has made it worse.

I continually find myself not sleeping at all several nights of the week, unable to find rest. My mind racing, telling myself how I'm going to fail at not only my education, but in turn life. If I don't get this stupid degree my life will end here. I'll never be able to accomplish any of my dreams. I find myself sitting my car at 3am, staring out the windshield at a packed parking lot, wondering how all these other people are doing this. I can't be the only one who feels this way- but alas everyone seems to have their shit together. They don't get sick their first week of the semester and subsequently get dropped from half their classes. They don't ever forget to jot down a midterm in their calendar and miss it. They don't. I do.

Do I have to really go to university to get this degree to get anywhere? Can I still pursue my dream without putting myself through this? What is the point in all of this?

I'm just- I just wish there was an easy way to tell if I was going down the right path before it's too late.

Lately I have been really considering dropping out or switching majors. I want to switch to computer engineering but I feel that it's probably too late now. I qualify for the program but it would add another six semesters to my time in college. 

I feel like the switch would get me motivated again. A BS in computer engineering would give me more options for jobs that require me to really think and challenge myself, while the options for a BS in biology are limited and wouldn't pay as well. This is a difficult decision to make.

The most logical decision would be to buckle down and push through, but my heart is pushing me to jump at the opportunity to find something I may really be passionate about even though I'll have to invest more time and money in college.

 I'm not exactly young and I am already in debt. I am 26 years old and married and I have spent the last six years or so trying to find my way in life. I have worked a number of different jobs, taken classes at community college, tried a technical college program (I didn't like that either) and now I'm well into a BS in biology as I already stated. 

My wife is already into her career and she makes a decent living to support us both while I'm still in school. 

By the time I'm 30, I need to be into my career and paying off my debt.

It started when someone accosted me, screaming and swearing in my face, and I responded by literally just saying ""get out"". I did not raise my voice. I did not threaten him. I told him to leave, full stop. The guy claimed I had ""intimidated"" him, after the fact. They kept me on disciplinary probation for two years before I eventually left, at one point even directly telling me that I had not violated the student code of conduct. They challenged me to take them to court, but at the time, I did not yet know my rights.   


When I eventually reached the point where I was unable to actually *do* my work anymore, I walked into the Assistant Dean of Student Conduct's office doorway, declared him too biased to do his job correctly, and I left. I had withdrawn from all of my classes before the hour was up. The Assistant Dean tried to stick me with a whole bunch of charges, but the only one I remember was ""Misuse of University Facilities"". Because I stood in his doorway without making an appointment. The allegations were clearly designed as a personal attack, but I had already dropped out by the time he issued them. I had a single meeting with someone on campus after the fact and though they got most of it dismissed, I do not know what stuck; I was not planning on ever returning.  


This happened eight years ago. School policy states that any holds are dismissed after seven years, unless they involve a student being either expelled or suspended ""and re-admission is contingent upon completing the sanctions"". Somehow, I still have a hold on my account. (I have 63 credits and wanted to pick up an Associate's Degree from one of the regional branches for my trouble.) The only way I can see this happening is if they suspended me while I was not enrolled in any classes. Is that a thing they can do? It does not make any sense to me. The individual that harassed me is still in the same position and I have been unable to make contact with his new boss.  


(As an aside, said individual engaged in behavior that was pretty overtly prejudicial against me on the basis of my autism. I was literally written up for my facial expressions at one point. I am not willing to engage with that person. Even Disability Support Services more or less told me that I was not eligible for their services because my disability was social in nature.)

The college I went to for one semester was 15 hours away from home and at the time when I committed to the school, I was “better”. In the sense that I thought I had my shit together and I thought I could go away from home and be away from my family but mentally and physically it was so taxing. I had already attended orientation + committed I couldn’t really just take it back. So I was planning on killing myself (I’m sorry if this sounds morbid or eDgY I just don’t know how else to word this) But I pussied out because im a really big coward and I ended up going to school in Mass. all throughout the semester I was really sad and homesick. Everyone gets that way I thought so I should just try to get over it. But I really couldn’t get over it. I got really unmotivated to do anything and I cried everyday. My ED got even worse because I didn’t want to spend money on food for myself since I felt I really didn’t deserve it. 
So knowing the only way I could try to save my sanity, I dropped everything and went back home during winter break. I told my family I lost a scholarship (which I did) and I decided to take the next semester off to just work. But they expected me to go back to school next year. And well...

I tell them I go to the local community college but in reality I don’t. When I leave for “class” I’m really just leaving for work, shopping, or to go eat. And it’s not that I didn’t try to enroll in classes, every time I drove 20 minutes to the campus, went in front of the college, opened the doors, and went to what seemed like the counselors/admission counselors office I started shaking like crazy and I couldn’t breathe well. I don’t know why but I got so so scared and I felt myself starting to cry because I was ashamed to have to explain myself to this person who will judge me for not having my shit together. So Id just leave because I got too afraid of what others thought of me.

I feel really ashamed of myself for running away I just want to try to pick back up the pieces. So if anyone who’s read this far can give me some guidance, where do I start the journey back to college? Obviously I don’t want to go back to the same one, I didn’t even fill out drop out papers. I didn’t even pay back the $5,000 I owe them from my lost scholarship so I can’t get my transcript.

I have royally fucked up in my last two semesters, and have lowered my cumulative GPA to an absurdly low score.

My first semester, I had a ~2.4-2.5 GPA. Second it dropped to a 1.8 due to some personal issues within my family, which then led me to a 1.5 GPA in my third semester. This has made my cumulative GPA become a 1.9 overall. Which is way too low, and I know I can do better. I want to know, how hard will this be to 
1.	Raise to AT LEAST a 2.0 GPA
2.	Attempt to work toward a 2.5-3.0 cumulative GPA. 

Since I am only 3 semesters in, I’m hoping I am able to work hard alongside my advisors and tutors to raise these, and hopefully can pull myself out of this hole I have dug into. I know why I have got into these issues, and those distractions and issues have been cut from my life, and I am ready to focus in on school.

Basically, my question is, looking at these current numbers, is it feasible for me to get back up to a 2.0 from a 1.9 cumulative, and to do so, what GPA should I be working toward this semester.

848,TeenageDeveloper19,1578460200,/r/college/comments/elo4pb/do_i_accept_my_yale_interview_offer/,"So, a couple days ago I received an e-mail from a Yale alum offering an interview. I didn‘t expect to receive an offer, so I hadn’t given it too much thought. I e-nailed him back to let him know I’d get back with him soon (I didn’t want to just ignore the poor guy). First, some background on me (feel free to check my post history if you want more):

I dropped out of school after the 8th grade. My father wouldn’t let me go to school (long story, but picture severely obese anti-vaxx alcoholic), and I couldn’t afford homeschool, so I studied independently. Over the last few years life has sucked pretty bad. I never got to leave the house, so I developed some serious social anxiety, it got horribly lonely, and I started taking on more and more responsibility, to a ridiculous level of daily stuff. I decided this year that I wanted to go back to school. I tried returning to high school (I was nearly able to take classes during the day and test out of some others so I’d graduate in a year or year and a half). That didn’t work out, though, so I took and passed the GED. I took the ACT and got a 33, and the SAT Subject tests (bombed those because A. my calculator broke the night prior, and I couldn’t find ANYONE with one to borrow and B. my dumb ass filled out the answer sheet to one wrong), and I’m going to CLEP Calculus, pre calc, college algebra, and college composition.

While I know in my head what I’d say to most of the typical college interview questions (they actually come pretty naturally: I know what and why I want to study, and I know exactly why I want to go to Yale). But, I do horrible in social situations until I get to know someone. I don’t want my interview to go awful and have the AO’s get the impression I wont be able to function socially. I know I can, it just takes me a little longer than most.

Also, I don’t know what I want to say in my interview. I don’t want to be vague about my obviously very unusual teenage years, but I don’t want to get into specifics and turn the whole thing dark and negative.

I’m worried I may look foolish (for lack of a better word). I haven’t had any extracirriculars, I dropped out and all I have to prove my knowledge is ACT and CLEP scores (and a transcript I made up, big whoop), unlike all the other kids that have been groomed to go to Yale I haven’t had any private tutoring, I haven’t taken AP or IB classes/exams, I wrote my essays and revised them myself, I don’t play the bassoon or build nuclear reactors in the garage. I just don’t feel like there’s anything obviously special about me. I know what I am capable of, and I know I could handle the Yale curriculum. But they don’t know that. All they have is my word. What will I say to the guy?

So, do I accept the offer?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Also, does anyone have any info on what an interview means so far as my admissability (Just made that one up XD)? I googled it, and some people say it means you’ve passed the “first round”, some people say a larger percentage of interviewed applicants are accepted, some say it’s random, some say it’s a bad thing. The Yale website itself seems a little confused. One page says that interviews are given “at random” to “as many applicant as possible”, while another days interviews are given to applicants they are “interested” in and want to know more about.

I petitioned to get it removed but I doubt it'll work because it was my responsibility and I fully accept it. I just want to know if I should actually be worried about it?

Hello everyone, I've just received notification that I've been ""academically dismissed"" from my small private university for not meeting their academic standards. I have the opportunity to appeal the decision and maybe continue my third year of undergrad, so I thought I'd reach out for some advice on crafting this appeal. I desperately want to complete my degree.

I'm in my thirties and I've been working 60+ hours a week including some overnight shifts, which had me missing an inexcusable number of class meetings. Things have cooled down at work so I was very optimistic about next semester. I really had no clue I was at risk for dismissal, I was looking at it as though I were just a sort of customer and had a certain degree of freedom to relax or ramp up my dedication to the endeavor (wrong).

I don't struggle with the coursework at all, it's just punctuality that I've lacked. I either get perfect grades across the board or like this semester, all Incompletes or Fs because of attendance.  
Another motivator to repair this debacle is that my father is on the board of regents for the university and I'm low-key terrified of injuring his reputation. I haven't name-dropped yet at all; I don't want to be part of any actual or even perceived impropriety. His position there is the entire reason I switched tracks away from going to a state school, and also means my tuition is heavily discounted. Is it needlessly pious to avoid mentioning him in the context of my appeal letter?

Any advice or similar situations to relate, on the topic of dismissal appeal letters and using (vs. not using) family connections? Any obvious blind spots in what I've written?

TL,DR: Missed a lot of class and academically dismissed. I love my university and want to finish. Requesting advice for appeal letter or relevant stories you might share, and how to navigate the whole situation considering my dad's position on the university's board of regents.

I started my college life at the age of 17, two years ago next month.  I had been homeschooled from the age of 7 and graduated at 16, then took a semester off; I started community college with a first-year seminar and a gen psychology class.  I passed four credits that semester with a GPA of 4.0.

Summer of 2018, I attempted six hours and failed.  My GPA dropped.  Fall 2018 was the same story, except worse.... and you can imagine where Spring '19 left me.

However, somewhere in the mix I got admitted on probation to my dream school, even with a 2.5 GPA.  I got admitted to the Honors Program and found out that my cumulative GPA would not include the classes I failed; they wouldn't even be put on my transcript.

Still, I was scared to death because here I am at my dream school, in my dream program.  Now that I've experienced life here, it's better than I ever dreamed.  ... but I'm still failing.  (At one point this semester I had multiple D's and C's.  My program has a required grade of B or higher in every class).  

At the recommendation of my sister I got evaluated for ADHD and learning disabilities and I found out I do have ADHD and a learning disability.  I got an accommodation letter. 

I passed every class this semester with an A or B.  My GPA is 3.57.  I'm still in Honors, I'm going to be a peer mentor next semester.

I live in California and the closest Community college is 30 minutes away from me and I actually did attend a few classes there but I wasting too much money in gas and it would take me 45 minutes to get out of the parking garage and that was if I could even find a parking space. the place was overcrowded with students not to mention there were a lot of homeless people just hanging around the campus and at this specific community college crime runs rampant. The professors were mediocre at best in fact one my professor's almost got into fight with a student and most of the support staff  were clueless and just didn't care about their job. I couldn't take some of the classes that I ""needed"" for the general ed with out having to take classes in both the morning and evening so I dropped out. The other thing is that I didn't have the best grades highschool but I know there decent enough to get accepted  some  universities and when I was a senior in highschool I applied to a few universities and was accepted into two but I couldn't afford to go to college at that time.

860,nanotech23,1576441910,/r/college/comments/eb47x1/i_hate_myself_am_mad_at_being_lazy_crazy_and_i/,"The last 4 years i was a neckbeard dropout. I dropped out because i knew by the then last semester that my mental health was awful and attending class was too stressful for me because i couldn't pay attention in class and couldn't be motivated to be consistently hard working and on task. 

by then i tried every adhd treatment and nothing really changed things without making the stress and anxiety in my life, which was already very bad, even worse. 

so i dropped out and in the 4 years i very aggressively worked with a psych trying literally everything you can take for GAD, depression, OCD, and ADHD all together. Because despite my track record, i do have goals and dreams i want to achieve. 

Nothing really changed my nature - which is having distracting thoughts and anger and emotional instability and no willingness to leave my mom's apartment - but my parents, my dad especially, kept on pestering me to go back to school. i knew i still wasn't ready but i also felt it had been too long since attending class that i needed to start doing something with my life again to feel better about myself. i hadn't been working either because my last job killed my self esteem because i was awful at everything and i couldn't even emotionally handle responsibility when i was working just 6 hours a week. 

This semester i have been taking 1 attendance-based class and 1 online class. The online class I am passing but the attendence class i might fail. It's an art class and i accidentally missed 1 project already (and there are only 4 projects) and this last project i can't understand the instructions even though they are written down in a handout. I have also missed a lot of class because i opted to stay home a lot because staying in my room is the only measure i can take that comforts my intense anxiety and depression and whatever else i have. when i'm outside i just hate everything and i'm constantly stressed out and exhausted that i'm not home.

So i don't know if i should even bother signing up for next semester. I'm starting to accept that i'm simply a loser, and while that isn't a productive thought, it's just starting to make sense because emotionally i am so messed up. 

like for the project that determines whether i pass or fail that i still need to do, my teacher has shown us a few videos of instructions, an in-class demonstration of the project process, and passed out a comprehensive write-up documenting the instructions of what we're trying to do, and i still have no fucking idea what i am doing. i literally can't comprehend or remember information that i want to remember, whether its written down or communicated verbally or demonstrated visually, and my problems solving skills....well, they don't exist at all. 

-------

so im at a loss at where my life turns to next because none of the medications im currently on, or have tried, work to make things different, and there are no medications left to try. the only psych medications that are left are for conditions i dont have. 

if i accept that im just an idiot loser that doesn't have the capability to even work towards my dreams, then i'll never be satisifed and i'd rather kill myself soon (as in the next few years, not right now) than see myself being in my current predicament and being 35 or 45 (im 26)",college,"I hate myself &amp; am mad at being lazy &amp; crazy, and i don't know if i should bother registering for classes next semester",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/eb47x1/i_hate_myself_am_mad_at_being_lazy_crazy_and_i/,1576459910.0

Would a business diploma get me no where? Or should I complete the degree or certificate at the university? I just find I don’t enjoy university much though.

863,khaleesi_onthatbeat,1576218502,/r/college/comments/ea0cd1/im_29_about_to_graduate_and_i_am_terrified_about/,"I graduated high school in 2008 in the USA. I busted my ass off then, was in all AP classes (except for math, my weakest subject. Looking back i think its because i didnt have the right kind of teachers or environment for my learning style, nor did i have the discipline and motivation or study skills at the time). 

My SATs slayed pretty well. I got into my dream school  and i pursued a design and tech degree in Theatre Arts. But the program and school I was in was more competitive than I thought, the community was toxic and superficial, i struggled living on my own, making meaningful friendships, and giving up all of my other hobbies to pursue a career in one. 

Turns out I wasnt disciplined or focused enough. I got warned and demoted from a BFA to a BA, and so had to take other required general classes that I had no interest in and was also separated and isolated from a lot of my peers. I felt ashamed. My family made sure to remind me how disappointed they were. All my scholarships and loans and hard work they put to get me into college felt wasted. I slipped into severe depression and it only got worse. I took a semester off. Which turned into dropping out completely because I felt ashamed and scared and my pride was hurt badly. 

I spent the next year living at home, working 2 part-time jobs and paying rent to stay with my parents and cover my phone and car insurance. I tried taking a couple community college courses. At the time, I felt so ashamed and like that this “demotion” was beneath me. From my perspective, only people from my high school who didnt have any direction or were high school duds went to community college. Very few of the people i knew who went there straightened themselves up to transfer to bigger schools or find a good career. A lot of them dropped out and still even now never finished or are on some path with little progression. Even some of the smartest and talented people i knew who messed up and ended up as pizza delivery guys or constantly working in temp jobs. At that time, I judged them, and felt like i didnt belong there. So i flunked community college too. 

I moved out of my home, across country, and started living on my own after some traumatic family events. I started working part-time in food service job and did just that. All i did was work and wander around my new city. I had few friends whom i rarely had time or energy to hang out with, but i did learn some new things. I learned depression management, i learned to keep my space clean and organized (the first time my parents visited me they were in disbelief at how clean my apartment was!), i began exercising again and lost all the weight i gained during college after stopping sports, and being on antidepressants and binge drinking and having poor eating habits. I taught myself how to cook and be more diverse and experimental with eating on a budget. I learned how to dress nicely and wear skirts and dresses and gained some more self-confidence. I got promoted twice until 3 years later i was in a high management position. 

After that I had an opportunity to move abroad with my work. Once my project ended, i decided to stick around and do language study for a year. I also discovered that I could attend University once i passed a certain level of language fluency, for almost 10x cheaper than in the USA. So i applied and was accepted as an international student and restarted college studies with a new major in 2014. 

I was working part time, struggling a lot to pay for school AND living expenses on my own. I experienced racism and stereotyping, neglect towards the international student body and preference towards exchange students from my school’s administration and faculty. I missed out on a lot of the “fun” parts of being a college student. I never explored or traveled around or near the country I was studying in. I had some other traumatic experiences - severe illness. I failed my first semester because i got pneumonia during final exams. I almost died the year after from a heart infection that turned out to be due to me developing an autoimmune disorder and it set me back financially and gave me a lot of stress. But, i started to pay more attention to taking care of my health, eating better, exercising more. I quit a toxic job even though it paid more. I found a lesser-paying, more physically demanding job, but it was close to home and school and my management and coworkers became my family for over 4 years. I got back into sport again. I started really exercising again and my health improved. I made more friends. Despite everything, despite my anxieties and stresses and bouts of depressive episodes, the overall quality of my life did improve a lot. 

I struggled with my grades, managing study and work and having a social life and did not successfully avoid burning myself out. Taking courses bilingually is HARD. 

I dealt with some fuckboys and fake friends and manipulative and self-centered employers. I met the love of my life and also have my own chosen family around me. I was injured and needed surgery and had to quit my team. Only recently, a year later am i becoming active again and overcoming that psychological hurdle. The people in my life who really mattered showed up and helped me through a lot and are by my side still to this day. I rediscovered my faith in God and became more religious which has helped me develop more self-love and patience, manage anxiety, and make even more new friends and discover new things about life and people. 

I finished my last lecture of undergraduate studies today. I have only one final exam and two reports due next week and it’s all finished. Come February I will be matriculating and getting that damn diploma, with a BA in Linguistics and double major in Cognitive Neuroscience and a minor in English Language and Literature. It took me 5 1/2 years to finish this degree. I am almost 8 years later than most of my peers. I have friends and family who are married, getting married and have kids and bought their own homes and even finishing masters and phDs. 

Its so hard not to compare myself. Or minimize my struggles because there are people who have it worse or didn’t even have the opportunity to get a college education. I feel ashamed to celebrate this achievement and feel like its mediocre and nothing special. have been a student and struggling to survive on a minimum wage for so many years, to imagine that I will have a job that pays me every month consistently more than enough that i need to barely survive, have health insurance, a regulated schedule, moving beyond student life...it feels unreal and its terrifying. I still have no idea if what i’m doing next is the right thing or where it will take me. I’m trying to focus on the fact that its out of my hands. I can do my best to sway towards my goals but only God knows where i’m going to go and where i’m supposed to be. I hope grad school, marriage, my own family, an established and forward progressing career, and opportunities to do good for the world are in my future. 

Sorry for the long post. But i just wanted to share. Everyone is on their own path, and their own timelines and not all people do things in the same way as people expect you to. S*** happens and life sometimes sucks a lot most of the time lol. Appreciate the good things as best as you can and focus on the lessons and realizations you can learn from the bad things. Question everything but TRY not to question yourself. (Ugh, i know, easier said than done) Usually your heart is always telling you what’s right. 

Get organized. Use a planner or calendar or whatever method helps keeps you on track of your life. Eat more protein and vegetables. Be active. Cut out toxic people from your life even if it means you have no friends at all for a while. Revisit old friendships that sizzled out. Stay in touch with your family.  It is possible to work and be in school. Part time jobs are not beneath you and teach you valuable social and work ethic skills. Change your major or do a double major or take general ed classes in things that interest you or may teach you something useful and supplementary. Manage your budget. Do things you like that aren’t harmful to you or other people. Practice empathy and kindness as much as possible. To others, and yourself.

Location: Indiana

I’m a female pre-nursing student who was studying in the group study area of our college library with another female classmate.   This is literally an area meant for discussion and interacting with other students. The rest of the library is the “quiet area.”

It was right before our midterm exam and ironically we were studying on our own and not really talking. A male student got upset when we actually did talk and asked us to be quiet. We informed him that he was in the wrong section and that he should probably move to the quiet section, and that were allowed to talk.  We pointed out that we sitting under the group study sign! 

Well, he didn’t appreciate us telling him that and he exploded and started yelling, cussing, calling us derogatory names, and threatening to harm us. 

I immediately went to get the librarian to ask to speak to him and security was called.

He left when security was mentioned and continued his cursing tirade as he left. An incident report was filed and I thought it was the end of it. I couldn’t identify him again if I saw him, as I was seated with my back to him as this was  initially occurring. I barely spoke to him and the other female student literally sat there shocked and was like. “Dude, wtf.” 

We figured, he was stressed about the exams and he took it out on us. Rather than move to the quiet section or put his headphones on, he vented his frustrations on us. Not cool, but not worth us Dwelling on.

A couple of weeks ago, someone from the school called and said they had spoken to the male student. I believe it was a Dean. He said he understood about the group area section of the library and that the reason he got upset is because one of us dropped the “n word”. 

That absolutely did not happen! It did not come out my mouth. If he was called anything it would have been “dude” and those words to do not resemble each other.  I can’t say what was said in the thirty seconds it took me to walk across the room and speak to the librarian, but I’m positive that the other female student never said those words either. He was already cursing! 

Seriously, that word would not come from my lips. While I am white, I have black and biracial nieces and nephews that I love very much and would be upset if anyone used that word against them. I would be incredibly disappointed in being associated with anyone who would use that horrible word. 

Anyway, The Dean made it sound like the librarians vouched for me because I am a regular and I am friendly with the other students. However, she seemed to focus on the possibility that the other female student. 

We haven’t heard anything since, but the other female student mentioned it to a coworker in the medical field. They said that we need to make sure this does not go into our records and to seek legal counsel because that would prevent us from getting into clinicals and finding employment!!

I’m upset that rather than take responsibility for acting irrationally, he gets away with assaulting us. And he gets to victimize us again with a false accusation. I don’t want to destroy him, but he needs to learn that threatening females because he’s irritated with school/life... and throwing that kind of accusations unacceptable.

I’m at a lost as to who we should contact and if legal counsel is really needed?  I actually told my advisor about this and they made no mention of an accusation like this going into my record. I did look up the Dean’s name on the school’s website and I could not find her contact information, though my advisor said this was a real person.

I was excited for one of my friends for a while-- he had bad depression when we were in high school and didn't go to college, but a while ago online he mentioned wanting to apply and go next year (we're both junior-age). I hadn't talked to him for a long time, and I was honestly really happy for him. If I'm being honest, that is one of the things that spurred me to reconnect with him. 

But I asked him about it today and he said he's not going to apply anymore and is just going to move in with a friend at some point. 

I'll admit, I jumped the gun and had already thought of us going to college together, but I couldn't help but feel sort of disappointed in him.

869,PoetWarriorLover,1575497052,/r/college/comments/e66su0/27_a_fresh_start_afraid_of_my_potential_or_lack/,"So I'm not old, I'm 27 (28 real soon). But I'm unsure how much potential I have for improvement, what my ceiling is and that has been a big scary unknown since I started my studies at my university.

A bit of a backstory (There will be a TLDR if you want to skip this). 

I had a fairly chaotic childhood. Despite having two loving parents, they had serious demons which I'm somewhat sure were a reason for my public and high school experience. My grade two teacher actually told my mother that I would probably only ever be a C student (Insane to make that call), and I had no real direction or interests that motivated me to try in school. I never did homework, would get zeros on assignments and still passed because I tended to test well. In highschool I was pushed not to pursue university level courses (applied vs academic is what they were referred to here), the academic level courses I took I either failed or scraped by with a 50 due to my motivational problems. When retaking the same course I would usually finish the year with at least an 80-90 with a bit more effort on my part, clearly I wasn't just lacking intelligence...?

&amp;#x200B;

So after high school I worked full-time and fell into a bad crowd for me, an insecure guy without a male role model (a group of testosterone, alcohol fueled bros who wanted to be the biggest thing in my small town) I was beat up one night while drinking with them and after 10 months of solitude (they exiled me for pressing charges) I decided I had to leave my town (I was 22 with no life experience). I moved to Toronto to enroll in a college course I had little interest in, to escape, reinvent myself and because it was the only school that would accept me and my poor academic record. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did pretty well my first year despite some mental health issues, probably due to abandoning all of my comforts at once and moving from a town of 20 thousand to almost 3 million. I entered my second year still battling depression, social and general anxiety and by the time my 3rd semester of the program came to and end I was pretty sure I wouldn't follow through and work in the profession I was studying. At the start of my 4th semester, someone accused me of sexual assault to make their ex jealous (I know, wtf). I was arrested, kicked out of my residence and finished my school year couch hopping until I could rent a room with friends I made in my first year. Even though the charges were dropped, and my record was eventually cleared, my school expelled me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I began working retail, got a bit healthier in the head, and after 2 years I became miserable again, I was making money, had a great girlfriend and wide social circle but felt so empty. Video games, and other 21st century vices were just fillers for the parts of me I never explored as a child and adolescent. A friend of mine lent me Crime and Punishment and all of a sudden I was entranced, I had never been a reader apart from books with movie and video game adaptations (Lord of the Rings, Warcraft novels etc.) This type of reading felt different, I read 1984, then I discovered Christopher Hitchens from his ""Four Horsemen"" discussion with Sam Harris, Dan Dennett, and Richard Dawkins, so I read Hitchens books, then Jordan Peterson's... For the first time in my life I felt attached to a respectable ideal, a well read, well spoken person who could form their own opinions and defend them without fear.

&amp;#x200B;

I got into a very competitive school here through a mature student program and finished at, or near the top of my class, my professor even told me I have a natural knack for writing (wow something I'm good at, that doesn't embarrass me). I received an academic award/scholarship for the first time in my life as a 27 year old, the ceremony is in February. It's an incredible feeling, but I'm scared that I'm pretending to be something I'm not.

&amp;#x200B;

I look at my professors, my TAs, people like Hitchens, Peterson, and I think that these people were put on this path starting in grade school or earlier. They were nurtured, encouraged and pushed until their own individual greatness propelled them further. I'm a late bloomer from a broken home who is trying for something better, but I don't see my potential being anywhere near these people. IQ is a real thing, no matter how hard I work.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how extensive and sustainable mental plasticity can be, I've successfully reinvented myself but I don't know if I'll ever be as good as I want and that's kind of terrifying. I have days where I can read and write, and feel happy with it, and there are many days were I can't read an academic sentence with more than two commas and remember the meaning of that sentence. The jump from 1 to 3 classes has been very challenging and while I feel like I'm getting a grip on the learning curve, I just feel like something will give. My motivation and focus, my fears, my finances... et cetera. I know imposter syndrome is a real thing, and that we should never compare ourselves to others but it's something we all struggle with as humans, no?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently set on a philosophy major so I can learn how to think, read and write but it all seems a combination of dry, difficult and very demanding of time. I want to teach as a professor but the alternative plan is to do a double major in psychology as well, and be a clinician so I can help people, like I've been helped over the years. I just don't know if I have the smarts and work ethic to do it, the task seems to be above someone the likes of me and that I'm merely pretending to be smart in an effort to find some sort of passion, or distraction from life. Maybe they are the same thing...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, that was a lot to type, I'm sorry for sharing so much. It just kind of flowed out of me. Is there anyone out there who has walked a similar path, or has worked a student in a comparable situation? I feel like I'm the only one with my story, and while it's empowering to think of the obstacles I've overcome, it's also scary to think that I might be fairly alone in my fears...

870,-b-r-u-h-,1575426108,/r/college/comments/e5s78w/pros_and_cons_of_transferring_back_home/,"i'm low key considering transferring. it's just sort of been on my mind lately and i...can't get it out of my head. i changed my major after two years, and i'm. not totally sure it's helped. i can barely focus. i like the idea of this major a lot more than i like my last one, but i just *suck* at chemistry, which this major has a lot of (it's not chem). i planned on getting out of my room more this semester, but it's hard - yet i noticed i am constantly out of the house on break. these are my tentative thoughts about leaving. 

&amp;#x200B;

**pros of where i'm at now**

\- location is awesome - middle of a small city with nature on its doorstep. weather is pretty good (winter aside) and it's honestly super pretty.

\- decent size - 25,000 students, so definitely not small, but it's not massive. big enough to have resources, but still small enough and with a large portion of commuters or online students that campus is still a manageable smallish size without being tiny.

\- i'm not a football fan but i have to go to all the games and the fact that we win...well, it's a plus. much as i hate the long days and standing for hours on end in the cold, i love the engagement we get from fans and how into it people are.

\- i love the band. our director is awesome, we sound great, our shows and music selections are very cool. i really like the style of shows we do and our other gameday stuff is really cool. we get to travel too, which is awesome.

**cons of where i'm at now**

\- the weather is an absolute drag once it hits fall/winter here. it snows, but never enough for it to stick, so it's just gray and sloppy and miserable all the time. the weather back home is much nicer (much farther south) and i get cold really easy.

\- i have made a grand total of two friends here, despite being a junior. i'm not very social in general but even this, for me, especially being away from family and pets and in weather that just makes things worse...

\- going back and forth all the time sucks. i hate that i can't hang out with my best friend from home for months on end, and then i can't hang out with the friends i've made here during the summer. i miss home all the time, especially my dog.

\- i'm pretty depressed. i've noticed it is worse when i'm here, probably due to stress + isolation.

&amp;#x200B;

**pros of the potential home university**

\- it's closer to home. this is a pro in more ways than one, since i am on a pretty big scholarship here and in danger of losing it. i'm also pretty certain i won't graduate on time, and my scholarship won't keep covering that long. my parents tell me not to worry about money but i can't help it and it would make me feel a lot better to take those costs down - especially if i switch majors again. getting unconditional instate tuition and not having to worry about my scholarship (which makes it possible for me to attend where i do now) would be amazing.

\- frankly, they have *way* nicer facilities than we do here. the campus is huge but it's ridiculously nice and every time i've been there, even though i'm overwhelmed at how big it is, i'm impressed by how nice their buildings are.

\- i volunteer at a specific place whenever i'm home and being in my home state would let me do this more often. there's nothing remotely like this place where i'm at currently and i miss it a lot.

\- more opportunities in general, stopping me from being torn between two states 1000 miles apart. i'm already vaguely planning on going back to my home state after graduation, since i can't stand being so cold for over half the year.

\- my mental health is not so hot and i know i'm in need of therapy or counseling or something. constantly changing locations (home, school, going abroad) made me loath to start something over the summer when i spoke with my parents about it because i knew i wasn't gonna be home long, and then i wouldn't be here long, and so on. if i stay in my home state, it'll be easier to get consistent help.

\- *the weather is so much nicer at home*.

**cons of the potential home university**

\- i will absolutely be doing marching band because it's just something i love so much, but there's people in that band and specifically in my section that i wouldn't want to put up with again (went to the same high school and they weren't so nice to me). i also don't really like their band director (though i've heard he's nicer to his own students).

\- the school is *massive*. there's something like 70k students on one campus. it's extremely overwhelming. i don't feel confident enough to talk to my professors in lectures of just 150 people - i can't imagine it in classes of 400.

\- would the school even take me? i had a very very bad sp19 semester. my gpa dropped like a rock and it's not going up this semester (my grades are better, but not enough to affect the gpa). my credits might not transfer properly either, setting me back further.

\- i will miss the away school. i really do like a lot about where i go now - but if i miss the people in my home state while i'm here, i'm sure i will miss the friends and the band here if i leave (especially since i already know i miss hanging out with them when i'm home for summer).

871,jesus4weezing,1575257993,/r/college/comments/e4t29k/compassionate_withdrawal_for_mental_health/,"I'm just wondering anyone's experience with a medical withdrawal/something so that you dont have an F on your transcript. Im happily accepted into my major's program regardless of if I finish this chem class and get credit this semester or next so that's not a concern at all. 

I was hospitalized 4 times for many times, was under general anesthesia 3 times, seen by many, places on a tricyclic antidepressants which spiraled me into radical anxiety and in the meantime am battling mysterious gastroenteritis, several peptic ulcers that as of the last week have been seen to be healing finally and symptoms that ended up getting in the way of me being successful in a challenging course. 

I'm passing all my other classes no problem, because the professors communicate, understand, and genuinely ensure that I'm not left behind as long as I still forge ahead when I'm able. However this Professor, mind you this is no flagship university at all, former community college that's now a 4-year college, no dorms nothing like that, doesn't put effort into responding to emails and has ignored 3 within 2 weeks and responded with asking me to instead talk before class when I couldn't because I would be going under for a procedure ordered by my doctor. I explained in length, which embarrasses me but has to be said for him to ascertain the situation. No response, nearing last couple weeks of semester. 

I have only been absent from his class two weeks or four total sessions to this date and once from early in the semester for a hospital stay so 5 times all I have documents for and he has 1 document for the first absence. My issue isn't me getting thr C so I can move ahead here though, it's that I'm struggling hard between a bout with mental illness and several GI issues some thst haven't even been diagnosed as biopsies from polyps in my colon are being send to check for cancer, and the fact that I'm bad at chemistry. 

I'm bad at chemistry, I'm sure I could take the exam I missed and take the final which I was not in class for a good chunk of material nor the review but I would most definitely fail the class with flying colors because of the grade scale no matter how you slice it. It has me stressed out because although my illness has kept me homebound for only this short time I've been living with it since a couple weeks before the semester and fighting it all the way. I dont want an F, and I dont want a passing grade I dont deserve, I want to be able to retake the course, next semester, without the increase in tutition for retake and maybe not show up on otherwise very good transcript? It would follow me everywhere if I had a WF or F in this important course. I want to earn the grade and am on a plan to be healthy and ready by the spring semester. 

My school has no online info about this subject, although because of an incident (student bringing a gun on campus and cocking in next to me in his jacket) two semesters ago I had an academic appeal filed and won when I had four classes (two spring two summer) dropped completely from all records because I dropped them due to weeks of victim silencing and questioning of me, the victim, and had to fight up the chain to the board of trustees to have that happen so I know the school won't be doing me any favors. Do I have to show them all my medical documents, even if i dont wish that the school sees my personal diagnosis for privacy concerns? (The counselor on campus believes that because I had a panic attack when the student had the gun that I'm cookoo and that because I pursued a security officer getting successfully fired for criminal negligence I'm a ""petty paranoid little boy).

Last fight was a nightmare, what channel should I take first as this issue will be handled these next couple days. Do I go to the provost who tried to silence the gun issue from all of my classmates via intimidation? Do I just see an advisor and tell her what's happened and see her deal? Do I bother trying to see the professor during office hours, or like I'm thinking will he just send me off to find someone else that manages this type of issue and be a way more stressful situation then needs be?

I appreciate any constructive feedback.

I am a non-traditional student who dropped out of community college at 19 to escape an abusive home life. I did poorly in high school/college 1st year because I struggled with parental abuse, untreated autoimmune disorder, and untreated PTSD. 

I married and moved to another country. We struggled with marriage and I struggled to be treated for my illnesses because we lived in a remote area. Then we moved back stateside where I finally received proper care. I went from severe agoraphobia to functioning okay within five years of persistent treatment.

Four years ago, I reenrolled in a local community college. Since then, I maintained mostly As and some Bs, volunteered/hosted community events, and maintained an internship in my future career field.

At the same time, I separated and nearly divorced my spouse due to infidelity. I supported myself working 1-2 jobs in a toxic work environment of sexual/physical harassment. I was sexually assaulted and the police did not follow state protocol for my case. My school advisors tried to ruin my academic reputation when an event plan went wrong (due to their mistake). I recently had to deal with unsafe housing conditions (raw sewage, bug infestations, etc) with government housing. Now my family member is in the ICU and my husband’s family received a bad cancer diagnosis for their grandmother. 

Honestly, I feel so tired and worn out. It sounds stupid, but I feel like life is working against me. I really wanted an education for so long, worked so diligently to get there, and now I feel like everything is slowly getting worse. I don’t know if staying in school is the right choice.

**Background:**

I'm a junior in one of the US's top rated undergrad film programs at a fairly prestigious university, and I want to transfer out. 

I've lost my passion for film and decided that, if I'm going to get an unemployable undergrad degree, it might as well be in something interesting and foundational to a fulfilling life and making good art. For me, that would be a true ""liberal arts education"" in philosophy, literature, sociology, etc, and afterwards I could get a graduate degree in a more practical yet adjacent field, possibly statistics. I can always return to film if I feel like it and actually have something interesting to say. The problem is...

I did extremely well in high school (4.2 gpa, 34 act, 1500 sat, extensively involved in activities, school politics, and volunteer work), but up until graduation my motivation dropped off, and, for no reason apparent at the time, I've been consistently exhausted and depressed since. I did ok in my first two years of college classes (3.58 gpa) but otherwise squandered my time by sleeping 12-15 hours a day. Of course, the program got more rigorous, and about a month ago I completely withdrew from class due to a period of debilitating depressive episodes. Since then, I was diagnosed with a rare sleep disorder that explains the exhaustion and lack of motivation, and was certainly an exacerbating factor for my depression. It typically develops in late adolescence, which is when I started having difficulty with productivity, focus, motivation, etc. I'm hopeful about my recovery and currently exploring long term treatment options, with which I should be much more equipped to take advantage of my education opportunities.",college,"Looking to transfer, a once impressive student with a debilitating illness",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/dwya6j/looking_to_transfer_a_once_impressive_student/,1573876095.0

Reason being everyone was doing it and I kind of fell into peer pressure again (I majored in bio in the past for the same reason but dropped it).   Im looking to go into a nursing program after college. Most of the programs say that one of the requirements is to have a bachelors in any degree no matter what, secondly they ask for a gpa of 3.0 or higher, and lastly they ask that you complete the 6 prerequisites.  My parents expect me to major in biology and nothing less, the only thing is that I am admittedly terrible at biology.  My grades in the past have proof of that, even with tutoring and hours of studying it just is not my greatest strength.  I understand that nursing probably has these type of things but the biology major at my school is so in depth into the sciences, chemistry, and so much deeper of everything and I just feel that is not a good fit for me.  I talked to my academic advisor and he recommended doing psychology as a major, due to it being a smaller and more condensed major to finish that is not so heavy in the aspects of science and chemistry.  It would also be a much better chance at keeping my gpa up, and there is enough room in the major that I could complete the prerequisites for nursing while finishing my major.

TLDR: dropped a really shitty English course and I feel fantastic. 

I took two courses this fall at my CC: computer science (required for graduation) and English 2 (also required). This is my 4th time taking this English course; i've been on and off attending this school since I graduated high school in 2012 and really didn't want to, but my folks made me. I failed because I stopped showing up 3 weeks in. 

When I decided it was the right time to go back, I picked a condensed course so my schedule wouldn't affect work for as long as a traditional semester. I also live at the bottom of my county, bordering another, so my commute (with north east traffic) is about  50 minutes one way.

I got stuck with a professor who hadn't taught at my school before. He shouldn't have been hired. He should have retired 10 years ago. 

Never assigned a textbook or gave us any references, gave us about 3 handouts which were complete gibberish, a syllabus not meant for our course (which he edited to 10 pages from 5 with the assistant chairperson of the department after I complained I had no idea what was going on). We tried to ask him when assignments were due and instead of just giving us dates he went on these long diatribes about ""yes, no, sure, whenever you want to hand it in is fine, or if you don't want to hand it in that's fine too."" Some classes we sat in silence for the duration. 2 hours of silence I paid for.


I scheduled a meeting with the asst and chairperson of the English department. Some students like having professors that teach like this; the don't have to show up until something is due or there is a test. Not me. I paid for an education and this is not anywhere close to learning. I leave the classroom feeling dumber. I told them this and they told me there wasn't anything they could do bc switching my class or finishing online would be ""unfair"" to the other students who are confused/frustrated in class. They told me I could go to the learning center and they would teach me everything I needed.

Since that meeting a week ago, circumstances in my life have changed, requiring me to move to a different county (one with a much better and closer CC, mind you) and I realized I can't afford to drive 80 minutes (actual commute time with traffic) one way for a class where I sit silently for two hours two days a week. Now that my partner and I have our own place, I need to be working more. So I dropped the course last night. I thought I would feel guilty or like I did the wrong thing but I feel so much better that I don't have to waste my time there any longer. I missed the cut off where I can get any money back, but I'm going to see if they'll work with me at all (maybe get my therapist to write a note on my behalf).

More than anything I just wanted a decent education. I told the chair people this multiple times and they didn't really seem to care.

The thing is, I got accepted at the top university in our country, under a good course. But it took me not too long to withdraw enrollment there because of anxiety and depression I got due to how toxic the place is where the school resides. So, I decided to go home in the province and take a year off but I feel even worse now that I dropped out of uni because I feel like I lost sight of what I really want to become in the future. Recently, the school registrar told me that I could still enroll back next year under the same degree program. I'm a bit reluctant. I want to grow in that school, but the environment just doesn't do me any good and I am scared to develop those extreme panic attacks that I felt during my stay.

I am, as well, planning to continue college in a local state uni, a less prestigious one, here in our place. However, similar with the previous uni, I am not entirely sure if I would want to pursue the program I applied for, but, the environment I guess is undeniably more conducive and serene.

A lot of people keep on telling me to go back to that top uni since it's a very rare opportunity, but I dont think I could stand with the noise of that city. Not to mention that while dealing with the environment, I would still need to deal with extreme academic pressure. But it really feels bad to miss another great opportunity that not everybody gets to have, somehow I feel like I'm considering that school because of how prestige it really is.

Sadly, I am still not seeking any doctor to help me overcome this anxiety due to money issues :((

894,pamisaul,1571168018,/r/college/comments/did2ea/leave_of_absence/,"The situation I'm currently in is pretty complicated, so I'll try to trim some unnecessary details. Here it goes:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a CC transfer student. Five months ago, which was the start of the summer before my transfer, I started questioning whether I wanted to keep going to school or if I wanted to take a one year break. I'm pretty driven, reasonably smart, and I'm up for a challenge, but I just wasn't feeling passionate. I did \*the most\* while I was at CC, and adding all of the work  it takes to properly execute the transfer process compounded the load, so I think I  was feeling burnt out. But I realized I wasn't happy because I was committed to transferring to UCLA, a school I didn't really want to attend. So I switched my registration to a school at which I thought I'd be happier and thus more successful in my higher education endeavors, but alas...

I was pretty excited once I switched and committed to the new school. But with the first week, I was feeling weird...almost unsettled. As if I made the wrong decision -- not that I should have gone to UCLA, but that I should have taken a break before my junior year. I prayed about it, but ultimately brushed it off. Then, DAYS before the deadline to pay for Fall Quarter, I found out I was disqualified from receiving a Cal Grant. Disqualified! The California Aid Commission didn't even notify me, I had to find out for myself. After a very complicated and stressful week of back and forth calls/emails between various institutions, it comes down to me having to unexpectedly take out a loan and shell out a ton of money I wasn't prepared to spend. I wasn't able to pay by the deadline, so I got dropped from all my classes. However, it's a soft drop, and as long as I can pay by this Wednesday I should be able to get everything back on track. I can file an appeal with the Aid commission (the reason why I got disqualified wasn't my fault), but appeals take about eight weeks and this one likely won't win me anything. 

As I was trying to solve this problem, I kept encountering roadblock after roadblock. I'd pray ""if this means I shouldn't go to school, then give me a firm sign. but this situation seems fight able, so I'm going to keep fighting and trying to stay in school despite this huge an unexpected financial burden."" and then I'd confront an obstacle. As I've gone through this whole thing, it's basically made me second guess everything. It was so stressful and upsetting, and now I'm just burnt out. I'm tempted to do a complete withdraw and apply to the state school by mom's house, so I could live at home (not pay rent), take a break (because I wouldn't be able to attend until next fall), and just not deal with the school I'm at. I didn't mention this before,  I'm still commuting to school about 40 minutes and paying rent on my own, both of which are a burden. The state school is only 15 from my mom's house, and since I consider myself pretty driven, I know I could make it a good experience and forge some opportunity. At this point, I'm feeling so deflated and unmotivated that I could probably survive and get my degree at my current school, but I don't think I'd be able to do much else. 

I thought about living closer to my current school, but it's not worth it to leave my community (I have a great part-time job here and lots of good friends and I'm very relationship oriented). I thought about the fact that if I switched to the state school, I'd be delaying my graduation. At this point, I'm kinda okay with that. I'm just conflicted, because part of me says I should just stick this out.

It starts with sorority recruitment. I initially came in with the idea that I was going to join a sorority in order to find friends and a community. Everyone I talked to told me pretty much everyone gets into a sorority and I’d be fine. Flash forward to the end and I’ve been dropped by all 14 chapters. It was heart breaking. I came to this school not knowing anyone but my roommate (more on that later), so I was essentially alone.

The next month kinda flew by and I managed to get my footing and was beginning to really enjoy being here. I still only ever hung out with my roommate, but it was enjoyable enough. But midterms came and I open my calc exam booklet and halfway through the allotted three hours I burst into tears. It was the hardest test I have taken in my entire life and it was worth 25% of my grade. I got a 52% and got extremely lucky that the class average was so bad that my prof offered extra credit.

So things should be looking up at this point right? I thought so too. But on one of my hardest days of the week, when I’m in class from 7am-9pm with few breaks in between, I make the long walk back to my dorm to see my roommate for our ritual Wednesday night movie and hot cocoa. But what am I greeted with when I get to my room? Nothing. All her stuff is gone. She left. And didn’t bother to tell me that she was planning on moving. I texted her asking her why, and she made claims that I constantly yelled at her and was “too messy”. First of all I was cleaner than her, she left her dirty underwear on my side of the room CONSTANTLY, and we only ever had one argument and it was so stupid that I didn’t even realize it was an argument until she told me it was. I tried to be the bigger person and tell her I was sorry that living together didn’t work out and I’d like it if we could come out of this not hating each other, to which she left me on read.

So here I am now. In an empty and lonely double room. I have no friends now. I have nothing to do with my downtime. We are already halfway into the semester and I think I’ve passed the deadline for making new friends. All my plans have backfired and I want nothing more than to go home at this point.

Because of this, it was past the add/drop date to enter classes. 

I was advised to ask the professors themselves to put me into their classes since an adviser couldn’t put me in classes nor could I, since it was a week late. 

However, I automatically get dropped at midnight if I don’t pay. This happened for all my classes. I was dropped from them all. 

I got put in the classes again by my professors when they noticed I got dropped. I realized I would just get dropped again since I couldn’t pay for it, so I decided to do it myself instead of wait until midnight.

Big mistake. 

Instead of automatically getting dropped, it showed up as a withdrawal — which means now it’s a W on my transcript and I have to pay for the class since it was past the drop date. 

Except, I got added past the drop date and dropped the next day anyways. I was going to be dropped at night by the system regardless and wouldn’t have been charged. 

Can I just explain this to my adviser? Obviously I don’t want to pay $1,000 for 3 classes I was going to be dropped from anyways. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)

I'm more focussed on my volunteering job at my local fire station and getting ready to leave for the military after college (Running. swimming, lifting etc).

It's not like I feel depressed or sad, because I know what that feels like, I just have lost interest. I really only can stand one of my classes which is a US Foreign policy class with a great professor and then I tolerate Spanish because it's semi interesting.

I think the main turnoff is how stupid I feel in these classes and how pointless the material seems. Just writing this out now I'm realizing it's one class that is giving me the biggest issue. The people in the class are pretentious and the professor lectors like they're giving a sermon. I think I could solve a lot of my stress by not being in this class but I'd have to replace it with something else.

When I was 18 I went to my first school, but dropped out after the first semester as I was not in a good place mentally and took the next semester off from school. As this was happening I met my ex girlfriend who turned out to be very seriously abusive. Long story short, she ended up wanting to go to the same college as me in a different state and then immediately turned the abuse up to 10000%. I was suicidal and suffering even more severely than before; not being able to eat, get out of bed, self harm, the works and dropped out. I don't even know if I have transcripts from there or not because it was such a blur. After a couple months I managed to take a couple classes at a community college. I transferred to my current college about 4ish hours away from home in the beginning of this year (winter semester). I'm now in my second semester, but I am struggling deeply once again. I've realized that moving away from home (my support system, mostly my family who I'm extremely close to, my animals, my therapist etc while dealing with narcissistic abuse syndrome) has isolated me more than ever. There's a college near home that has the exact program I want to study (I'm unhappy with my current major) that I didn't even know existed until my therapist brought it up to me. The problem is, this would be my FIFTH transfer and I've already had to withdraw from two classes this semester because I'm unable to keep up and I think I'm either going to have to withdraw (or failing) another class. I genuinely just want to do good and I'm not a lazy student. I've just had a terrible couple of years and I'm trying to figure out the best thing for me, as it's incredibly easy for me to spiral out of control. So I guess I have two questions: Is transferring for a fifth time too much? I know it's a lot and I'm incredibly embarrassed by that and the fact that I'm only taking three courses this semester. I have anxiety attacks about not getting accepted because if I don't I'm going to have to stay and be miserable with my life and school work as there are no other majors that I'm interested in here or that would be useful. My second question is given my history, would it look worse on transcripts to drop the class or end up failing it and taking the hit to my gpa, which is really the only thing I have going for me right now. Any advice is welcome, just please be kind. I know I fucked up and it's my own fault and I know this is such a trivial problem compared to what other people are dealing with.

the only general math class i have to take is a Math115 (intermediate Algebra) course. when registering for classes, this class section was at the best time for me, but teacher was TBA. i looked up all my other professors on rate my professor as i registered and they were all cool so i decided to take my chances. (this part right here was hands down the WORST decision my poor naïve self made.) 

...fast forward to first day of school. i get handed my syllabus, Professor starts explaining how it works and by the end of the class i wanted to puke. my heart dropped and i knew this class would drag me by my hair screaming and crying to the end of the semester. 

the class works like this: 

1) all work is done in ALEKS. for anyone who has been graced with not knowing what this is, its a *VERY* universally hated online math program. ""topics"" are problem subjects inside of a ""pie"" and every ""slice"" of the pie is a subject (real mumbers/linear equations/polynomials/etc.). each slice has varying amounts of topics.

2) every topic has to be completed for you to pass. all 250+ topics. it doesnt matter if you take the paper final and pass. if you dont pass ALEKS you fail. 

3) homework is open in a window of friday-thursady 11:59. you either get 10pts or 0pts. you cant get partial credit. it doesnt matter if you're assigned 32 topics for the week and you do 31. if you dont do 32 you get 0pts. 

4) ALEKS will decide when you need a calculator. also no calculators on the paper quizes ever. 

5) its a M/W/F class. M/W she lectures for 20 mins on a few of the topics then we do hmwk for the rest of class. F we get a 10 point quiz and then group work. in group work we get a packet of unfamiliar problems and we get to teach eachother what to do. (i take issue with this because i have bad anxiety about doing math around people) 

6) if you cant complete your homework you still cant complete those topics. why? well when the next hmwk cycle begins ALEKS locks every unit before it. you have to work to finish early to beable to get to those previous units. 

7) Knowledge checks!!!!! basically, ALEKS sometimes forces you to take a test (that isnt graded for the class by my professor) to make sure you actually learned the topics you completed. if you get a question wrong you have to redo that topic. see 6 for why thats horrible. 

8) if you have less than 4 abscenses you dont have to take the paper final, you can only take the ALEKS comprehensive. when asked about how hard it is Prof deadass says ""oh no one has had to try more than about 5 times."" like...the fuck? 

so. this being said we now arrive to right now. I've talked to my professor 3 seperate times about why this class stresses me out so much, and i ask for just a little bone, just something. maybe an extra day for homework, maybe being allowed to use calculators (im a bit bad at paper add/sub bc i go fast and make dumbass mistakes. i know how to do the algebraic concept but some topics take me hours bc i do small fuck ups), unlocking previous topics so i can be sure im still up to speed, less topics every week (week 1 was 25 tpcs, 2 was 32tpcs, this week was only 13 but they were very tedious and very difficult,), partial credit on hmwk, just...SOMETHING. 

i explained that ive already spent lots of time crying and stressing over this class and its so early in the semester. so she pulls up my student report and saw that last wednesday (week 2) i spent 4.5 hours working, and that i worked on my homwork a bit every single day. she asked me how many credits im taking (15), and when i  answered she simply said that it was my fault im stressed because im probably taking too many classes. i was like??? no???? i need to take 15 a semester to graduate in 2 years (im going for an associate.) i know the content of the class but the amount of work with all these resrictions is what makes this more difficult than even my 4 credit class. 

she didnt care though and she waved me away. this conversation happened about 2 more times after this. im upset and frustrated because im doing my best to make sure i succeede and following the advice of ""talk to professors early! they'll work with you if you're dilligent!""  but she just. doesnt care. it doesn't help that when she DOES actually teach its super grating to listen to because she talks like she's teaching 5th graders. i still do my part and take notes for things i dont know but im at a loss. putting so much focus on this class is fucking with my time management for my other classes' homework because i have to spent such a disproportionate amount of time here. 

ALEKS is also horribly finniky. i typed an answer as 13x-5x^2+13 and got marked wrong because it wanted -5x^2+13x+13. without stating anywhere that answers were ONLY accepted in standard notation. mind you tho, it accepts things like "" 45/9 "" and "" 2/8 "". 

Im currently doing my best but this class is making me despise math all over again, even though i know algebra can be really cool and im actually decent at it. how do i deal with this? should i keep talking to her? I've been thinking of just going to the department head, because im not the only person in this class struggling so much.

916,bamlaw,1568869244,/r/college/comments/d69a6p/frat_roommates/,"Long story short our college got mad at all the frats and sororities and took away their houses and gave them apartments on campus instead so that they’d have RA’s and other university staff monitoring them. 

My roommate and I have always lived in the apartment across the hall from one of their frat apartments. Apparently over the summer they had a housing mishap and switched us across the hall to the frat apartment. Me and him are both pretty introverted until we get to know people really well. I thought since they knew we weren’t in their frat they’d be nicer and would go to some of their other apartments (which they said they’d do). I was wrong. Very wrong. Every morning when I leave my room there’s at least 2 boys sleeping on our couch or our floor, usually more though. There’s also usually 5+ frat members or their girlfriends here all hours after 4 pm. Currently (almost 1 am) there’s around 15 in our living room. They usually stay till 2:30-3am and then either leave or sleep on our couch/floor. They basically get wasted every night and then pass out or walk home. Like I said me and my roommate are pretty introverted until we get to know people so for the past month and a half we’ve basically been like prisoners in our own room because anytime we go out there it’s 2+ new people in addition to the 15+ that we already don’t know. Because of this most of the time we just choose to stay in our room and talk to each other. We even put off meals and other things until we hear them leave momentarily when we can slip out without going through a throng or random boys. I haven’t ever even sat on my own couch or used my own kitchen because their stuff is always piled on top of everything or they’re all out there just staring me down when I walk through the living room to go anywhere. Also all their girlfriends are starting to stay too. One of them dropped out of school and now just sits around here all day watching TV and napping on our couch. I can’t use the washer/dryer because there’s always their bras and panties all over it or sitting inside it. Half the time the hot water is gone because the girlfriends take hour long showers when they wake up. We also have a zero tolerance alcohol policy at my university this year and they basically get shit faced every night and leave beer and liquor bottles all over our apartment. We could all be kicked out and pay a fine if they find the alcohol. 

I understand we are in their frat area and we aren’t members and they probably don’t want us here at all but at the same time we got moved here against our will and I called housing multiple times to no avail. It was basically go here or no housing for you and I can’t move off campus because they have age requirements to do that and I live too far away to say I’m a commuter. It’s also extremely expensive too and none of my state/fed scholarships would cover off campus. I’ve never wanted to be apart of any fraternity or anything of the sort so I guess I don’t even know if this is normal really???

We have a meeting tomorrow with the director of housing and I’m going to ask that we be allowed to move if there’s any open spaces in any other apartments no matter where they are on campus. He seems to think they’ll be able to talk to the boys and get them to be more cooperative. I worry though that if they say something the guys will hate us and make it even worse. We’re the only two who aren’t in their frat living here so if someone reports the room they’re going to know 100% that it was us who reported them. 

Some of my friends think we’re being dramatic while others I talk to think we should’ve been bitching housing out day 1.

I know this is easier said than done, but assuming I can pull it off, what is it like socially being a transfer student?

So I attended college for around 1.5 years a few years ago. I had a lot of personal issues going on in my life - working a fulltime job, I was pregnant, death in the family, the works. School got pushed to the back of my mind and I eventually stopped going a few days into my fourth semester (spring of my sophomore year). I figured that since it was only a few days in that I would just be dropped from my classes and I could re-enroll later, or something, idk.

Needless to say this was 100% not the case!

They dropped me from school entirely. Since I had accepted financial aid for that semester, they wanted me to pay it back... even though it had all went directly toward my school balance. They told me this over my school email once and mailed a letter or two to a former address (which I changed online but they never updated I suppose) so I wasn't aware of it. But when I finally got a message to my personal email MONTHS later, I found out that not only did I owe all of the money, but now there were fees and interest on top of it.

All in all it added up to $10,000, which was more than I had even taken out in student loans over the four semesters. I was shocked. And then I realized they would not release my transcript until I paid off every penny. Whenever I did try to contact them about it, they informed me that this debt is already in collections and to pay it off from there.

As irritated as I was, I wasn't too worried because I thought I no longer wanted to go to college. I just... ignored it. I started paying back my federal student loans, but I figured the debt to the school just didn't matter. Plus I didn't want the transcript because I did pretty poorly in school and my GPA hovered around 2.0 so it didn't look good anyway.

Now that I've grown up a bit, I really want to go back to school. Working an hourly wage job in retail is not where I want to spend the rest of my life.

There is a different school in my area that has very very low tuition. I think it adds up to costing about $6000 a year including fees. I figure I can make monthly payments to the school out of pocket and just start over as a freshman, without indicating that I previously attended college. Or start out at community college and then go for two years. I had great high school records so I know I could get in on just that, but I think community college might help.

My issue is, would this work? Is it legal to omit previous transcripts if it won't help me / would just make things more complicated? I don't want to get in trouble but I just think this is so much easier and beneficial to me. (Plus in my mind, I already paid the school in entirety for the semester I did not attend. Why should I have to pay them again?)

The consensus across any other board I've read is mixed so I just wanted to specifically ask myself. So if anyone has any knowledge or advice I would love to hear it! Or even just direct me to a more appropriate sub. Anything is appreciated.

Apparently, people attending within a certain amount of time we're able to get their payments waved and taken care of, however it seems I'm still being charged, despite the school not existing anymore. This begs the question of where/ who my payments are going to, and considering the school does not exist, should I be required to pay at all? This debt is affecting a good portion of my financial well-being alongside other bills, and if possible I'd like to avoid tossing my money into a void. I'm not sure if this is the right thread for this post but I'd really appreciate some advice.",college,Paying a semster worth of tuition to a college that no loner exists,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cvsyos/paying_a_semster_worth_of_tuition_to_a_college/,1566866409.0
933,eversincetwoghosts,1566818838,/r/college/comments/cvmrk5/i_dont_know_if_coming_back_to_college_is_a_good/,"A year ago I dropped out of college. It was affecting my mental health, my life, self-esteem... The main reason was the course I chose, which was journalism. Well, I ended up ""choosing"" it because my family made me do it, actually. I didn't exactly choose it myself. 

Even though, I was trying to stay positive. I love to write and that was what I wanted to focus on during the course. The thing was, there was barely any writing at all. The whole course was a mix of press journalism, radio and television. First year was... okay. I had quite interesting classes and nice professors. But the second year was a nightmare.

I'm a very shy person and I use to rather stay in the back, so going to the ""television class"" and having to perform in front of other students, very demanding professor AND a camera was a really big challenge. I was trying to stay strong, sure, constantly reminding myself *""it's okay, on third year you're gonna choose a specialization, you'll go for press and won't need to worry about any cameras anymore""*, but it was still so hard to deal with the harsh reality. 

I was skipping the television class as often as I could. In fact, I attended just two times and then, finally realizing I can't go on like this and maybe journalism just isn't for me - I gave up. 

I took a year off, gap year of some sort, and found a... horribly affecting my mental health job. This year spent at my work place made it even worse for me than the whole journalism journey, not gonna lie. My depression reached its peak, I had to start taking medication, deal with constant anxiety and panic attacks, and if that's not enough I've developed OCD and suicidal thoughts.

The thing is, October is coming with such big steps and I know my Mom is expecting me to come back to college, find a new course, start studying again... But I don't feel like doing it. 

I know it's gonna tire me out again, both mentally and physically. Cause if I'm gonna come back, I'll be attending school on weekends. So it will be work on Monday to Friday and then college on Saturday and Sunday. The first year of college was okay because I wasn't working yet, but on the second year I was and with all the stress from the course, the additional work wasn't helping, just made it even worse like I said; But I have to work. If I'm gonna be going to school again, I have to pay for it and I don't want to burden my mom with all the money and everything. 

I know that if I decide not to come back, I'm gonna feel even worse than I already do. I'm gonna blame myself for being like this and feel like a failure again, like I disappointed everyone: myself, my mom... Like my sister is just gonna get another reason to make fun of me. 

She's a student too, she goes to college on weekends too, she works too - and she's dealing with all of these so well. I feel like Mom is so damn proud of her. Sure, they argue a lot, it's hard for them to find a common language sometimes, but it's not a secret it makes Mom proud to say how amazing and talented one of her daughters is, right? And then there's me - a college drop out who complains all the time because my coworkers hate me and make fun of me, because I'm depressed and feel alone, because I just can't find a place for myself in this world. 

I just feel so lost. I seriously don't know what to do. I want to learn, I want to be good at something... But I'm scared to go to school again to probably just fail one more time.",college,I don't know if coming back to college is a good idea.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cvmrk5/i_dont_know_if_coming_back_to_college_is_a_good/,1566836838.0

I was going for an AFA, and in addition to my art classes I took Psychology, Sociology, Ethics, a slew of English classes etc. 

Without studying a second of my life, I was the top of all my classes. It couldn't have been easier to me.

I dropped out of college before finishing my degree because I got a job in my chosen field and wanted to be full time. 

Fast forward 7 years... I am going back to school, and trying to complete my associates in science. I have a few semesters of Biology, Chemistry and Math to deal with. 

Biology and Chemistry so far have been pretty easy. I have had to study, but the lectures are engaging - I am learning fast, and doing great.

I am taking good notes, getting tutoring on assignments that I find difficult etc. but it is quite frankly VERY daunting.

936,Esani,1566540528,/r/college/comments/cu9teh/after_6_months_i_finally_made_a_decision_the_next/,"I posted this a few days ago on another subreddit, and I was hoping to hear this subreddit's opinions on it:

So I am an incredibly indecisive person, and I had been toying with the idea of transferring colleges for the past 6 months. I am going in to my sophomore year and spent the first year at an out of state college that is far away from my home. I chose this college because it had good opportunities for my intended major, linguistics. However, looking back I had a gut feeling telling me to not go to the out of state college. I dismissed this as simply fear of change and leaving my family, and decided to go anyways. The first semester started out rough, but I attributed this to homesickness. Towards the end of the first semester, I joined the fencing team, and I really enjoyed that.

However, second semester came and I started to feel different. I got into classes for my major, and I started to feel confused. The classes for my major did not seem that interesting. I started zoning out in class, and I honestly began dreading to go there every day. The 3 main reasons that I went there turned out to be kind of disappointing. However, I did find other reasons to be there like the fencing team, mountains, and the plentiful healthy food options. Soon, I felt oppressed by the intense desert heat that started to begin towards the end of the school year. I felt like I had to get out of there at whatever cost. I would wake up feeling angry because I didn't listen to my intuition at the very beginning, and may have been stuck in a state I didn't like because of a major I didn't want anymore. I went to an out of state tournament with my fencing team, and it was the happiest that I had felt in months. But when I returned, I was back to feeling down and sad all day, waiting for each day to end so I could be one step closer to leaving.

After coming home, I had to make the decision of whether to transfer to my in state college. For the entire summer, I have been ruminating about this decision nonstop. It has made me so tired and frustrated. My mom would always ask me which decision, and nearly every time I would say that I was leaning towards transferring. The price of the out of state with scholarship was not too different from in state without, so money wasn't a big issue. There are a lot of good things about the in state college, such as a very supportive advisor and proximity to family. I can keep doing some of the things that I picked up at the out of state college like fencing and eating healthy, although they will be harder to do at this college.

Well, yesterday was the final decision day. I had been enrolled at both colleges, and had to drop classes and housing at one of them or else I would get very large cancellation fees. I had new student enrollment at the in state college two days prior and I started crying in front of my advisor because of the stress of the decision. I ended up deciding to transfer to the in state college since I was leaning towards that most of the summer and had the gut feeling to not go to the out of state beforehand. Figured that there probably would not be some huge revelation in the next 24 hours that would reverse all the times that I said I was leaning towards transferring, and I dropped the housing at the out of state.

It is the next morning, and I woke up feeling incredibly nervous. I am worried that I made the wrong decision. This is mainly because I was not sure whether my push to transfer was because of genuinely not liking the state and university I was at or because I was feeling homesick. It's not like I felt horrible there all the time, after all. I would say my mood throughout the school year looked similar to a bell curve. I am worried that I left all my friends on the fencing team simply because I was homesick. Could it have been better to try one more semester and see how that turned out? After making the decision, I felt relieved for a bit, but indecision and doubt quickly began to creep in. I am really worried that I chose wrong, and that I will regret this decision later. I have yet to tell my friends at the out of state college (and cancel a few things). I just wanted to share how I felt after this long period of indecision, and hope that anyone can offer me some insight.",college,"After 6 months I finally made a decision.

937,nightblida,1566535719,/r/college/comments/cu934s/freshman_chronicles_day_1/,"Hi guys! If you want, you can read [the prologue](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cst1mm/freshman_chronicles_the_prologue/) to this post so it makes a little more sense. If you have already seen it or just want to jump right in, keep reading. This is long, but I wanted to immerse you guys into the story of my first day at college so you could somewhat imagine it. There's a very brief, much straighter-to-the-point TL;DR at the bottom though. Without further ado, here is Day 1:

&amp;#x200B;

Out of the five or six alarms I set, I woke up on the 3rd one. Which was the plan all along. That might sound troubling, but  don't worry; it's a system. I have it under control... Kind of. Ahem. Anyways, I got up and did a final look-over of my packing. Clothes, check. Food, check. Hygiene/cleaning supplies, check. Bunch of stuff acquired by reading through a dozen ""dorm essentials?"" posts on reddit? Check. There's no way a cold is sneaking up on me this semester. And rain is no match for me. I was even keeping a close eye on my clothes, due to a comment I saw about a guy actually forgetting his clothes once. At this point I pretty much had no nerves. I was mildly excited, and just ready to get some freedom. 

I wondered what to wear. What is the first impression I want to give off? Too cool for school (but cool enough for debt)? Maybe nerdy, goofy, etc.? I decided to wear red, just to stand out a little more (Hey, it's science--red is the first color our eyes register). My parents and I loaded my stuff into our car, and off we went.

I showed up, and was directed to check-in, while my parents were directed to the parking lot. This pretty girl helped me get some forms signed, and I went to meet my parents . As I was walking around, a little lost, I went to some stairs. I went up (instead of down, like a dummy) and didn't see the parking lots so I figured it was the wrong place. I left the staircase and went a different direction, hoping to see what I was looking for. These student helpers by the door saw me taking this strange route and yelled after me ""where are you trying to get to?""

I said ""The parking level.""

And one looked at me like I was slow and said ""the stairs are that way (*pointing* to the staircase that she JUST saw me leave, which probably added to the look). I sheepishly came back and went the right way. I brushed it off quickly, because she probably wouldn't remember my face anyway, and I've also learned that no one gives a crap because we're all focused on our own stuff all the time, so she'd forget that situation soon enough. I successfully met up with my parents.

Now keep in mind, my dorm is on the 6th floor. After attempting to bring a few items up with me on the stairs (because the elevators were too busy), my hyperventilating body and I decided we needed to get a large bin if we wanted to continue living. 

I saw my roommates when I dropped off the items ( I was the last one there). We had already texted a good bit throughout the summer, so we were somewhat familiar with each other. We got along quickly. 

I went to get the bin, and brought up my stuff in two trips. This took almost an hour, because the elevators were SO busy. I actually stood in front of one for 20 mins before being able to get in. When I got onto an elevator for the first time, there was another person with a large bin inside, so there was not a lot of space, and it was hot. I looked at the student that qas helping guide the elevator and she just looked at me with a face saying ""yup, this is what I've been going through all day.""

I looked at her and jokingly said ""so, how's your day going?""

And she said ""You know, it's been a lot of ups and down.""

 I don't know her name or even remember what she looks like, but I will never forget what a legend she is.

I'm sure the wait times may not surprise any of you, I'm guessing this is par for the course when it comes to move-in day. Once I finally got my stuff all in my room, I said goodbye to my parents. It wasn't any type of teary goodbye. It was a somewhat casual see you later, my mom being the most sentimental of us all.

It was just my roommates and I by this point. ""Julia,"" ""Naomi"" and I unpacked our stuff while talking. They poked some light fun at me for having so much food (e.g. ramen noodles and snacks) when we had a meal plan. I had initially thought it was a 5-day meal plan instead of a 7-day one. At least I'll have things to eat when we get tired of the cafeteria food. 

Compared to Julia's side of the room, my side seemed bland. I don't have any posters at home, so I didn't bring any. I'm gonna order some later. But I realized I don't care about my lack of decor like I thought I did. I don't really have a ""theme"" either, but it kind of is what it is. I'm happy with how everything turned out when put together.

Once I settled in, I thought about the advice I heard on here about going door to door, but it just didn't seem plausible. Everyone's door was closed! The doors here are the kind that are heavy and tend to immediately close on their own, so I understood. No one wanted to go out of their way to prop it open. And they were probably busy unpacking. But I'd hoped that I could make some acquaintances in this way. Maybe tomorrow will be different.

I went to lunch with my roommates. The line was horribly slow, as everyone was setting up their fingerprints to access the dining hall. Naomi ran into a person she knew (who was also with her roommate). I introduced myself and we all started talking. About 30 or so minutes later, we sat and ate.

The roommate of Naomi's friend sat next to me, and I started casually talking to her. Here's how it went:

""Hi, can you tell me your name again?"" (I don't believe it was too bad of a thing to ask, as we had just met and she said it in a crowded line)

She laughed. ""Morgan."" 

""Ah okay, it was pretty loud over there so I wanted to make sure I had it right.""

""What's yours?""

This time I laughed. ""Nightblida.""

I asked the cliche question of what her major was. She said business and without further prompting, she told me why she chose it. It was along the lines of how she has always known that she wanted to be a businesswoman, and this was the first step. I personally don't really think it's necessary to go to college to start a business, but I respected her choice, and I liked her answer. I could see her passion for it when she spoke.

After some brief conversation, Morgan and her roommate (Naomi's friend, if you're keeping up) made their exit. Julia and Naomi hung around while I ate some peach cobbler, which was much appreciated. There was an event today (a football game, I believe) that I had no intention of going to. I know you guys encourage us to go to every event, but I just was *not* interested in a football game after how tired I was. I will go to every other one, though. This I promise. 

On our way back to our room, some girls we were on the elevator with asked if we would have a floor meeting. I said I knew we would, but I just didn't know when. They thanked me and kept walking. I got inside and unpacked some more. My parents called, telling me they had got me a planner and told me to meet them outside to pick it up. I remember mentioning to them that I didn't get one in time, but it was a very welcome surprise. '

I decided to take the elevator. A group of girls were there, talking about who knows what. If it was one person, I would've said something but I decided not to insert myself into whatever they were doing. They got tired of waiting for the elevator and left for the stairs.

As if the universe had read my earlier thought, a guy walked up. Here's how that went:

I decided to just go for it. ""Hey.""

He looked up from his phone. ""Hi.""

""How's your day going?"" (boring, I know, but it's all that came to mind.)

""It's alright. How's yours?""

""Pretty good. What's your name?""

""Brody.""

""Brody."" (this sounded less weird in real life, I just repeated it as a confirmation). *Points to myself first. ""*I'm Nightblida.""

In my head: *What are you, an orangutan?* *Why in the world did you point to yourself? Who else is around? It's not like he was about to mix you up with anybody.*

I ignored my inner dialogue. I asked him his major, he replied ""film"" and I told him that I had considered it. I then offered up my major. I noticed at this point that I had to offer up info twice (my name, my major). So while he wasn't being the slightest bit rude, I figured he wasn't too invested in this conversation. Not that I could blame him. I asked some pretty rudimentary questions. 

I let the conversation cease and proceeded to pick up my planner from my parents. I planned (heh, get it?) to sit down tomorrow and write out all my assignments and quizzes from the one syllabus  (last time i checked)that has been posted already. Once I came back, I finished unpacking in a comfortable silence between my roommates and I. I showered, and then started typing this.

So overall not much happened today. I had a loose expectation that I was gonna be able to talk to a lot more people, but it didn't turn out the way I thought. But it's fine. The magic is still in the air, and day 2 is mine for the taking.  I'm not really homesick or anything. It's pretty chill here. Maybe I'll feel it more when I wake up and I'm not at home.

If you read all or most of this, thank you for taking this ride with me. If you guys have any comments, concerns, or advice, by all means. Let me know. How will tomorrow go? (Technically I know it's tomorrow because it is midnight here, but I haven't slept yet so it doesn't count right?) Will I make any solid foundations for friendships? Will I meet the love of my life? Or will I just have a normal, average day? **Find out next time, on Freshman Chronicles.** 

\^I'm \^sorry \^I \^couldn't \^help \^myself.

TL;DR: I packed my stuff and went to school. I made a few directional fumbles and interacted briefly with some people. My roommates and I texted earlier this summer, so we got along well today. I didn't talk to as many people as I wanted to, but it's been one day. I have a good feeling about the semester.",college,Freshman Chronicles: Day 1,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cu934s/freshman_chronicles_day_1/,1566553719.0
938,Jasonwj322a,1566493832,/r/college/comments/cu0edv/is_it_too_late_to_get_my_gpa_up/,"Here's some background information. I dropped out of high school due to truancy and proceeded to get a GED from a program suggested by my counselor. After the GED, they gave me an option of getting a free 2 year college degree at a local community college. I took the offer but since nothing has changed; I'm still struggling to keep up.I'm 18 and I'm practically lost. I'm going to college like it's still high school. I don't even know how the tuition process is like since the program I'm in covers it. I'm in constant fear of what will happen once I'm out of the program or would they kick me.

Back to my original question, I at the minimum need 90 credits and a 2.0 GPA to get a transfer degree to a state university. I'm not sure if I shot myself in the foot here or not by taking college level classes and not even dealing with the issues that got my kicked out of high school in the first place. I have a 2.58 GPA currently with 30 credits. I think there are retaking classes but I'm not sure whether or not my program would cover that too. Despite knowing I need to deal with my mental health I still am going to continue taking classes too. I'm not sure what will happen if I pause with the program. Somehow I got a 4.0 GPA in my last class so I would be taking a class with the same professor next quarter. I'm just afraid of not being able to transfer. If I can't, I will be truly lost. My whole goal was to get to a 4 year university and if I fail I don't see myself succeeding in any other way. With an average of 5 credits per class, I really don't have much time to get my GPA to a decent one. My guess is I need at least a 3.5 from what I've seen. I'm in the Seattle area so University of Washington is where I'm really hoping I would be able to transfer to. I'm trying really hard to work on my mental health but with the constant stress of my current classes and future ones, it's really tough. I guess I'm here looking for hope more than anything.",college,Is it too late to get my GPA up?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cu0edv/is_it_too_late_to_get_my_gpa_up/,1566511832.0
939,AEntunus,1565998453,/r/college/comments/crecsn/frustrated_with_university_wasting_my_time_and/,"  Greetings,

  I have been pondering the question of dropping out many times, especially after my second unsuccessful year. Below I have listed my recent thoughts, why I feel lost and don't know what to do. Would be very appreciative of some advice.

  Thank you! 

&amp;#x200B;

1.The Summer Regime

  I’m currently caught up in the activity of wasting away my summer holiday. Since I failed the better part of my university year, I’m encumbered with the task of resitting multiple exams. However, I sense that time has set in the bottom like residue. Days drip away into nights with no distinctive characteristics among them.

  I waste away my days instead of preparing for the exams. I have no motivation and feel constantly stressed. Not only do I have no short term goals or desirable rewards, so as to push myself to learn the material, but I’m on the brink of giving up and dropping out altogether.

&amp;#x200B;

2.Forced into an Unsatisfying University Pursuit

  I didn’t even see the point of getting into university in the first place. It was all due to pressure from my family and from all my peers pursuing a degree. I chose Chinese, because it was the only Bachelor’s I could apply for after blowing away the last three years of high school.

  I applied in one university, felt unsatisfied throughout the whole year, so I dropped out midway and transferred to a different one in a new city.

  However, I still struggle with the same concepts and problems. I don’t feel adept enough at this point in my life to pursue higher education, in terms of university at least. My growing up was problematic; I fear this has stumped my mental development in a way – I’m 21 years old, but have experienced so little of my teenage years, I still feel as if I'm sixteen.

&amp;#x200B;

3.The Link between a Lack of Skills and Pointless Employment (Currently Unemployed)

  I have very few personal, employment-worthy, skills if any at all. I have a decent understanding of the English language. That’s it.

  I’m awkward with people. I don’t really know how to deal with more demanding social situations.

  Not many places offer apprenticeship or proper intern positions that teach you from scratch.

  My only option currently is being employed in a pointless, low-paying position.

  This is where University is kind of paying off. It is a purpose that will always be, or at least look, more appealing to some mindless odd job. Plus, its dorms provide an inexpensive roof over my head, some comfort. Many students do this, they go into University and barely score the grades, just so they can have a cheap place to sleep and do whatever else – working, working on personal projects or partying. I’m not one of those people however.

&amp;#x200B;

4.Hobbies and Getting in *the Zone*

  Hobbies are a different beast on their own. If I have to pin down my hobbies, they are: playing the guitar, reading books and doodling in my notebooks.

  Do I do them however? – No.

  I spend most of my time staring at the computer screen. I don’t even do anything. It’s not like I play games, watch movies or TV shows or anything like that. I just waste my time. Nothing productive or entertaining comes out of it.

  I haven’t read a book or played a song in weeks.

  This is where my frustration with getting in *the Zone* comes in. Getting in that special place can alter your perception of time, your needs of thirst and hunger, but I have trouble getting in there. This is surely a psychological problem. This is the logic behind it:

  I waste a day, I waste two. It’s almost five in the afternoon, I don’t want to start reading, writing or playing the guitar, because it will require starting power to get into it and I’m sure that once I do, some crap will pull me right out. How I know this? – It has been like that for years. In the past couple of months, it has usually been a stupid roommate, who will be bothered by the noise of the guitar or would like to go to bed at 7pm. (I swear to God I’m not joking.)

  A different situation – I have to study. I don’t feel like studying, so I don’t study. I want to read a book, but it will take away from the mind power I don’t have for studying. So, now it’s don’t study – feel guilty. Don’t read a book – feel guilty. Read a book – feel guilty, because you’re reading a book and not studying.

&amp;#x200B;

  How do I deal with all of this, I have no idea. Please, give me some advice.

I went back at the age of 23 since I wasn't really doing much with my life and wanted to try and better my chances at a decent paying job with a degree. The problem is I have no idea what I really want to do. I am just studying psychology for now as my associates degree. But I'm not if I want to be a counselor anymore, especially considering master degrees cost a ton of money and I do not want to be in a situation where I am piled on student debt. I just want to  get at most a bachelor's degree. But the problem is I'm not sure in what field.. I hear a bachelor degree in psychology is useless so I don't think I should keep continuing with that major. 

I feel I am in a bit of a crisis. First I wanted to major in nutrition then backed out when I realized I had to take many heavy science based courses such as Chemistry, organic chem 1 and 2,  human anatomy, (I have a disdain for science courses and really weak in science and math area in general, I know I would have achieved high grades), so then I thought about being a kindergarten teacher, I volunteered at a preschool and first liked it, then got burned out later on and crossed teacher off my list. After being in nearly a year in college studying psych, I am not sure if I really want to be a counselor anymore, despite wanting to help others. I am very shy, anxious, and introverted, so I feel counseling may not be my strong suit.

now that leaves me feeling very stuck. I think I will just end up working in an office or research assistant at this point. I literally don't have much passions or interests really.  should I even bother pursing a bachelor degree if I don't now what major? should I take some time off again and go back when I really know what to do? or just major in anything and try to network and hope it lands me an ok paying job..

I was extremely anxious and depressed and went undiagnosed and unmedicated until recently. During the winter (still undiagnosed) I tried to get my math out the way but realized trying to do it sped up was a terrible idea. I got a D in the class. I’ve been doing a lot better, but tried to retake the math again in 6 weeks while working full time. It went horribly and i had to withdraw because I was projected to fail.

My school has a policy that lets you retake it 3 times. Of course when I was doing it I wasn’t expecting to have a CEO come visit my goddamn job and have my hours increased. I was expecting to be able to spend most of my weekdays doing homework and studying but I ended up just going to school and then straight to work until midnight, then try to do 80 problems in a night while running on monster energy.

So now I have to go to the counselors office and try to ask for them to retake it but the fall classes have all filled up. This is gonna push me back for transfer again. This is the only class that’s holding me back and it’s making me super frustrated. 

I feel like I’ve just been wasting time and fucking up all over again. All the schools I would like just based off aesthetics now seem impossible to get into. I feel like I have no goal.

Im not the best at math and last semester was a really stressful time I was working my first job and a full time student and I was really anxious and stressed out. should I take it slow this semester? was data structures hard?

For a bit of context, I’m soon to turn 19 and have been living abroad for the past two years of my life. Due to some mental health issues, I was unable to complete my secondary education dropped out of high school at the age of 17. This occurred half way through my junior year before I was even able to take the SATs. 

I’m now looking to return back to the states and obtain a tertiary education. It would be ideal if I can avoid starting out in a community college. I’m starting to prepare for the SATs and plan to take them towards the end of August. Do you think that is enough time to prepare? I have quite a bit of time on my hands and can dedicate a good 3-4 hours of my day to revisions. 

Another question I have is whether it’ll be possible to enrol this late in the process. It’d be great if I could start with the rest of the student body in September but I haven’t even applied to any schools yet. Will I have to jump in mid year or is it possible for me to start slightly later than the rest of the kids?

I'm feeling really unsure of college.  I was homeschooled my whole life and did well in school even though I never really enjoyed it that much.

After a few issues with the CC, I decided that it was time for me to attend the university (there are 4 campuses for the CC, all on opposite sides of town, and with the classes i need to take, I'd likely have to go drive all the way across town all day. The other issue is that I've had a few instructors that were horrible that the department heads did nothing about even after multiple reports from various students). So, at the age of 25 (now), I applied for the university. I got all of my debt paid off and was ready to go!

When I applied about a month ago for the fall semester, my intended major was geology. My end goal is to work in the field for a few years and then go teach college classes. The university's minimum transfer requirements are 12 transfer credits (which I have). The geology program instead requires 24 credits with a 3.0 GPA. Okay, that's fine, and I couldn't find the info on the site anywhere, but that's my mistake.

My next option was to change my intended major to geography. I emailed the advisor and actually got a response back today saying that I did not qualify (not enough transfer credits).

So, in my eyes, I have two more options. One, I change my major to undecided and take the classes I need to get into the program I want and then change my major to geology later. And two, is that I go back to the CC and hope for the best (another reason I want to go to the university is because of the integration, they have great science programs and require early involvement for the major).

I emailed the advisor for the ""undecided"" major to ask if I qualify. I mean, I'm pretty sure I do, but at this point, who knows? If this goes nowhere, I guess it's back to the CC for me?

And if you're wondering about since kind of forgiveness program for the university, I don't qualify for that either. My university has a fresh start program that's only valid if you completed 12 credits from anther institution within one year of leaving, which I did not.

Does anyone else have any experience with this kind of thing? I know, I know, a CC is cheaper and more flexible. I'm at a point where I only have to work on the weekends in order to make school work. And I really really really want the integration that the university offers. I want the early major courses and the awesomeness that the geology program at my university offers.

What would you do? And do you think that I might have a chance of getting into a program if I tell them my story? Are program entry requirements super strict, or can they make an exception?

963,glipglops4life,1561160737,/r/college/comments/c3icuy/help_with_writing_a_personal_statement_returning/,"So 2 years ago I dropped out of college after my grades dropped low enough that I was dropped from the engineering program I was enrolled in.  There are many reasons why this happened. First and foremost is because I let it happen, I did not put in the work and it became a snowball effect. On top of that, I was really struggling with balancing school and finances. I did not have scholarships or financial aid and was not being financially supported by my parents. I was qualified for in-state tuition but it was a large state college in a very expensive city to live in. So I was drowning in debt. I worked a lot of hours and really struggled to keep up with classes, homework, and sleep. I have generalized anxiety and depression which added to the equation. My partner of 5 years had just joined the Marines and shipped out at this crucial time when I was still able to turn my grades around. This left me alone for 9 months trying to manage my mental health, finances, and school on my own.  I was unable to maintain my grades and decided the best course of action was to drop out and get healthy and reevaluate my goals. 

So, I have now decided I am ready to go back to finish my degree at a much more affordable University and live with a family member. I applied recently for the fall semester and was not accepted due to bad grades. I had feared this might happen so my back up plan was to attend a community college for a semester and transfer over to my desired University in the Spring. So I called admissions to see if they could help me find classes that would best transfer over from the community college. However, when I got a hold of admissions they told me that I already have quite a few credits and I should not go to community college. They wanted me to just rewrite my personal statement and talk about what has changed that will make me successful now that I am returning to college.  

I have a general idea of what has changed that will help me succeed which is: maturity, better time management skills, financial stability, I will live with a family member so my living will be much more affordable, stable mental healthcare, I now have a much clearer idea of what my career goals are... 

I just really want to get into this University this fall semester and am looking for guidance on how to write the statement professionally with the most impact.  Are the ideas I have listed out above appropriate for the letter? If so are those reason enough to admit me back? Any suggestions when writing this personal statement?

\-Apply to highly technical program at well reviewed and reputable college (not uni, not a tv commercial college)

\-Professors don't distribute any syllabi whatsoever

\-Professors show up to class about 50-60% of the time

\-Professors don't mention what textbooks to buy

\-Have to buy a technical kit for labs, kit is missing about a third of the equipment on the kit manifest, can't buy extra pieces or receive them from the school, have to source them from another place and spend more money because they couldn't be bothered to check the kits for accuracy and complete list of parts

\-Assignments hidden behind paywalls (professors write assignments on computer, but instead of giving us the assignment digitally on our web portal, we're supposed to buy the assignments in hard copy, a process which would have required the prof to print out hundreds and hundreds of pages manually)

\-Profs regularly tell us to just google it if we don't understand something (a lot of time spent in class is just the prof on their phone scrolling)

\-In a Co-op Program, meaning we're supposed to receive a degree of advocacy by our profs to local companies in order to secure employment while still in school. The school provides no advocacy whatsoever and expects us to just get out there and find a job for ourselves. Fine, if that's what's expected, but it's a Co-Op Program, and that's not what a Co-Op Program is. No placements, no assistance. I'm paying tuition to go on a job hunt.

\-Most of our professors are not knowledgable enough in their field to be teaching the courses they teach, and will regularly just waste time in class.

\-Genuinely concerned that I'm not receiving an education good enough to be employed. The expensive piece of paper I'll receive will say that I did, but in actuality I'll know extremely little and potentially be in positions where I could very well kill someone.

\-Meetings with program coordinator are fruitless. Mainly paid lip service saying ""they'll look into it"" but nothing is done. Most of the program has at one point met with the coordinator and expressed all these concerns. Most of the program has dropped out.

974,Diabeeticus,1558504108,/r/college/comments/brkzeu/im_27_applied_to_my_community_college_and_im/,"Some background for context (TLDR at the bottom):



I graduated high school in 2010. I tried community college soon after graduation, and did very poorly. I did not take it seriously, skipped class, smoked a lot of pot, and wasted money. I dropped out and started working instead.

I've worked several jobs since then. I started as a event stage lighting technician, to a lawn care guy, to gas station attendant, to IT professional - in that order. 

My current title is Technical Support Specialist (promoted from Technical Support Analyst last year) at a fast growing company in the healthcare/wellness industry. I will be working here for 4 years in August. It's a good job, and I get paid decently for not having any college education. The only thing I have is my A+ cert I got last year. 

I was lucky to land my job, because my mom knew someone high up in the company who was looking for an eager candidate to add to his IT team. I fit the bill, and eventually got the job doing help desk calls/troubleshooting with end-users, some travel out of state to install equipment, PC imaging and configuration, etc.

I've always had a true love for technology, which was sparked by PC gaming at a young age. Most of my knowledge is self-taught through passion, and genuine interest on how computers work.

I like my job, but I don't want to be in the help desk world forever. I don't think there will be opportunity to leave the help desk position any time soon here, and if there is, it would go to a colleague who has seniority over me and the education to boot. Over the years, my manager has been trying to convince me to go back to school, invest in myself, and that I will excel at any job I go for, even if I leave this one. 

I have always been hesitant to go back to school, because of my past academic performance, and the fear of taking on loans and failing. I felt like work experience would be enough for me to move up the ladder to earn a good living. I just had to work harder than most to get there.

This very afternoon, something came over me and I decided to take the first baby step. I applied for the same local community college I tried when I was younger, and submitted my FAFSA application. I feel like I truly matured mentally since I first tried college, and have a different perspective on life and the future. I felt good after doing this, but the more I thought about it, the more uncertain I became.

The thing is, I don't even know what degree or program would be best for me. I'm really conflicted on what I want to specialize in. I have interest in video game development, computer programming, Linux, networking, etc. I do not want to waste time and money pursuing college courses for something I am interested in, only to realize I hate it once I get deeper and run into a sunk cost fallacy. I'm told that's exactly what college is for though, finding what you want to do, finding yourself, and essentially earning a ""license to learn"" (words from my manager to me). I know for a fact I want to stay in the IT field, I just don't know where to go from where I am now.

After reading my community college's website, they use a placement test called ACCUplace. Their website recommend I download a free app to try some test placement questions. I did this, and I didn't know a good portion of what was asked. I even struggled with some fraction questions. I feel stupid, and disheartened by this.

Do I go for a A.S. and transfer to a 4 year? Or would it be better for me to get an A.A.S and try for a higher/different position? Or possibly just focus on certifications?

I'm starting to have second thoughts, and wondering If college even the right step for me at this point in my life.

I would be attending night classes while working, paying rent and bills, managing my type 1 diabetes, fighting depression, and trying to live life the best I can. I feel like I am biting more than I can chew, and I am a bit overwhelmed just by the thought of it all.

What would you do if you were me? Has anyone here worked through a relatable situation?

Advice? Thoughts? Any and all insight is appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read.

**TLDR:**

No college education, currently working in the IT field, looking to boost my career and salary. Overwhelmed by the thought of college, and wondering if college is even the right step for me. Need advice on where to go from here.

You may think I'm exaggerating, but I'm not. I don't remember the last time I had legitimate homework or even struggled in class because the teachers just don't care enough to make challenging curriculum. Most of the work given (which isn't a lot) is stuff teachers ripped off online where the answers are really easy to find.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really scared that if I go to a 4 year off the bat that I'll be so behind and I'll fail a lot of my classes which I don't have the money to retake. I already committed to a school already (that I really like) but I can still get most of my deposit back for it so I wouldn't be out too much if I choose to do community first. Also, it's pretty easy in CA to transfer from community to a state school.

Another big concern of mine is letting my friends and family down. They were all so happy when I got in and they keep telling me how proud they are that I got in.

I really don't want to disappoint everyone, especially when they all supported me so much during school.

I'm a Marketing major and I registered for a Maymester Marketing course which starts on May 20th, but I spoke to a lady in FAFSA about how it'll be covered and she told me that due to Federal Law, FAFSA won't be dispursed until June 3rd. She informed me that the school is aware of that, and that they will still let me take the course. HOWEVER, she told me that IF the federal loan doesn't come in on time, then I'm responsible for paying that tuition on June 3rd by 5PM out of my own pocket, and then I'll be reimbursed later on when the loan comes in. If for some reason the loan doesn't come in on time and I don't pay it (Which I definitely can't afford), then I'll be dropped from all of my other summer courses that start on June &amp; July and will get a hold on my final grade for the Maymester. 

This is really frustrating for me, because I've never taken a Maymester course before and I'm worried the worst will happen. But then again everything could go smoothly as well. 

I do have another option though.. I can take an Investment class that starts in June, but it's pretty unrelavent to Marketing which is my major, and plus the class doesn't start till 5:30PM so I'll have a 4 hour break..

980,Xavien5,1557954260,/r/college/comments/bp3jpp/conflicted_feelings_about_my_major_really_long/,"Hello all, I'm writing this message even before I really start writing it, I already know it's gonna be a long post since I'm providing many reasons for this conflicted feeling I have with my current situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Starting this off, I'm in computer science major, as an international undergraduate student (yes here for 4 years) at National Taiwan University (NTU).  The major is indeed, extremely hard, as our major's ranked globally top 40 (though I think it's been fluctuating to top 70's due to some political problems) for computer science majors of all the world's universities.  I'm not trying to brag or anything, but this is one of the points that would contribute to my struggling thoughts.

Right now this is my 2nd semester here as an 18 year old in Taiwan, the place where my immigrant parents grew up but had me born and raised in Silicon Valley, California.  Over the course of these 2 semesters, it has been multiple times that I have considered alternatives of changing majors, going back to the US, starting a side-hobby that may help, etc.  Many reasons have led me to stagger and think much more than twice and I will list them, so please bare with me.

1. I was not entirely sure about my major choosing it during the college application process starting the summer going into senior year but because it seemed kind of interesting and lucrative for choosing computer science for the future, I settled with it.  I have gotten A's in the few computer science classes I took in high school as well.
2. Growing up, my parents have always viewed me as smart (I know, I sound really full of myself listing these reasons and I apologize), due to my performance in schools with the levels of class that I was able to excel and skip and the programs such as GATE, for the gifted that I got accepted into.  This led them to pave a road that would secure a future on a path for making good money with a solid job, rather than a subjective job that could result in unfortunate scenarios.  Unfortunately, I guess I have inherited the science/math side from my dad as he's an electrical engineer which made those subjects easier for me, but also inherited my mom's talent for drawing and design.  I have always loved to draw and create 3D objects of my imaginations or some sort of creative object I saw in comics or on the TV.  But my mom knows how hard her path was to become a successful graphic designer with pretty insane salary during her years working, and didn't want me to go through the years of struggles and uncertainty like how she did.  This leads back to my the reason why my parents had me focus on academics in school instead.
3. Because I focused on academics, I took a lot of AP (advanced placement) and honors courses (probably around 13 AP exams were taken) over my high school career.  While it was gruesome, sleeping barely 3-4 hours a day while participating in varsity sports and clubs, I managed a 4.3 GPA which I still am upset at how my slight mistakes of B+'s dragging it down from a potentially higher GPA.  I advanced in classes still like how I did growing up and was able to take many classes 2-4 years ahead of people, and even took community college courses over the summer since those level of academics were not offered in high school.  It would be quite a shame to put all those hard work to waste 
4. Starting from this point, I will start to get into more personal/family situations.  One of the most influential reasons of finally deciding to come to Taiwan for this university was the networking and level of education I would receive after I graduate.  My school has close connections with even the famous US schools like MIT and Harvard since they excel in similar majors like my school, so they like having people from our school attend their's for exchange or graduate school.  The classmates I would meet here are some of the smartest people in Asia and for sure are not associated with anything out of the ordinary that makes them sketchy.  Also, improving my Mandarin Chinese would definitely benefit me in the future market since Asia is becoming much more essential in the role of supply and demand with the Western world.
5. While I do admit I grew up in a slightly above middle class child, since you had to be about that level to thrive well in Silicon Valley, where people see it as the famous place of technology.  My dad got laid off when I was 12 and we have been only gaining income from rentals, stocks, and other activities on the side.  Since I was born in the year of Dragon, at least with the statistics and the articles that were published for my year of college admissions, my year, 2018 was probably one of, if not, the worst year of admission rates.  The percentages dropped as expected with the growing population, but for 2018, it dropped at a much larger scale; some completely blew away our minds.  One of the popular theories of rejection from the typically seen as sketchy business from college admissions, is that they almost disregard your application and reject you if you have low incomes and have applied for FAFSA or other financial aids.  It's a similar problem that people persist, like how affirmative action is currently and other policital problems.  I personally believe this theory might have affected me a lot since according to my application, some of my friends I knew I had similar, or 100% better application than them but were rejected from the same college for the same major while they were accepted.  On an even more ridiculous aspect, my friends who were a year older got into most of the schools that we got rejected with very similar or even worse applications.  Most of us got rejected by California universities, especially the UC's, but a lot were accepted by out of state or international universities, furthermore supporting the low income theory.  I got accepted into computer science for schools like UW or Purdue, that were all ranked much higher than the other UC schools that people often viewed to be ""easier"" to get in.  This of course narrowed down my options which at the moment, going to National Taiwan University seemed like it outweighed the potentials of going to community college or going to universities I did not want to go.
6. Due to my low income starting middle school and busy schedules leading into high school, I have not visited Taiwan for 11 years until I came here for college last year.  Many family problems have occurred along with my relatives getting old, which I have been absent the entire time.  As an Asian descent, I happen to be the only boy on my dad's side to continue the last name.  This is just something I keep in mind and respect because I know how much my relatives love me despite growing up on the other side of the Pacific Ocean.  I wanted to also visit my relatives more and do not want to only come back to Taiwan to visit their funerals, as even some I have missed the past years.

&amp;#x200B;

The reasons listed here are mainly the reasons that have led me to eventually decide to commit to going to an entirely different country on a drastically culturally different continent.  Below I will list my current reasons on why I want to possibly change majors or go on a different path.

1. I believe I am not completely enjoying my major, or even any, at all.  But I know that does not necessarily mean I should give up immediately as many others are in the same boat as I am.  Perhaps I am just taking more General Education courses since I'm a freshmen or I am still trying to adapt to this culture, or the other usual reasons people have.  It might take a little more time until that spark flashes and my brain clicks which results in more interest.  Sometimes I might feel that motivation to work hard but I noticed that even if I finally solve an insanely hard programming task, I almost never, and have not for the past few months, that satisfaction of succeeding of overcoming a challenge like how I always did when I finished a creative project growing up.
2. Going back to the US, transitioning back to my roots will have cost expenses and if I regret my decision ironically, it could have pretty nasty drawbacks on giving up such a valuable opportunity I have at hand currently studying here.
3. Similar to what I mentioned before, I enjoy art and design related projects like drawing, building 3D objects, Photoshopping, video editting, etc.  Unfortunately, like how my mom believes, it truly is subjective.  From her experience, my dad really did have an easier life that in total earned more money than here and landed a life in Silicon Valley, despite neither of them being able to attend college due to the unorganized political state Taiwan was in when Jiangkai-Shek ruled Taiwan after losing to Maozedong.
4. The cultural adaptation is not the usual troubles of not being used to some habits or traditions of the people in the foreign country, but for me, it is within the academics.  Many of the teachings, besides half of the time it is in Chinese that makes it difficult for me to understand (most are in English because computer science relies on its roots in English), subjects like math are taught quite advanced as the stereotypes hold for Asia.  While I did notice that the topics covered are essentially identical to the Western counterpart, the numbers given are extremely hard to solve and we are taught more strategies to deal with them.  The most troubling part is often during lectures, the professor may seem to skip a step for me, but to my Taiwanese friends it is not skipping because it is assumed that they have always learned and knew those methods.  Obviously I never knew those growing up in the US since they were never taught.  This problem occurs in quite a lot of classes for me.
5. If you truly have read up to this point, I thank you.  But you may have noticed that I am quite a bit on the stereotypical-""Asian-American-with-immigrant-parents""-decision-making kind of person.  Unfortunately it is kind of true which leads me putting this reason last.  Growing up, especially when I got into high school, me just like a lot of other people, especially with the ""stereotypical"" Asians, we took the hard classes to boost our GPA.  But we all knew in our hearts many of the subjects, even without their weighted counterparts, were little to nothing on being useful to our life.  Coming to Taiwan and talking about this similar topic with my Taiwanese friends, they came to ask me that technically I am taking that learning about useless information in those irrelevant classes to another level as Asia always teaches the harder path.  This 5th point is kind of opinionated and probably does not matter as much perhaps to some readers but I thought I'd just include it because taking dis-interesting classes often led me to become stressed and overclocked with boredom throughout high school.

&amp;#x200B;

In my current situation for this 2nd semester that has about a month left, I'm just planning on soldiering my way through to the end first and try revisiting my interests during the summer.  I feel that I would be more passionate with a major that is related to art &amp; design like graphic designing, fashion design, animation or maybe even architecture (a bit of a stretch for the last one).  But as I have mentioned multiple times, it is a really subjective major; in our harsh reality, many people in subjective fields often are either barely surviving or just extraordinarily successful.  I probably missed some points and would edit my post later, even though it's already long enough, but thank you for reading and please give me opinions on this.  I have talked with my parents on my potential decisions on a few occasions now and we are still not sure about this commitment.

I didn't think this would be me. Even my English teacher in hs told me, ""yeah, you're not like that, you'll graduate in four years."" But, here I am. Talking to my different advisors seems like I'll just get judged(honors college advising, my program advisor and my major advisor).  So, I'm testing the waters here. 

Credits:54? 
Gpa: 3.25
Major:? 
Time when money runs out: 3 years 

The thing about the push to stem is that you get told all the good things and that ""anyone can do it."" So, I started in physiology(thought I wanted to be a physical therapist because of a hs class). Then I changed it to  computer science when I finally got through the doors because I liked it technology and the career path( didn't have to talk to so many people, I changed a bit since I can now do more social interaction). 

Only thing is that my math placement score was abysmal. Not surprising. My english score pretty much saved my SATs.  But, not to worry, a group was just founded that connected underscoring math people in stem majors to resources. The program worked for most people, actually one of the most successful programs to be launched as an ""experiment"" for my uni . Heck, I was considered ""successful"" because my gpa was 3.65 and I was invited to the hc after I was rejected because my SAT scores were 20? points below the threshold. But, my lowest grade was algebra. 3.0, on the back of a 3.5, but still a 3.0. I should have knew then because all of the rest of the engineering peers had 4.0s easily and were mostly invited to assit the class after the semester ended. But, I was advised to keep grinding. And I wanted to because I wanted to be successful at something and my mom was proud because she thought I was on the way to a lucrative field in comparison to my older sister who went the social work route(I'm first generation, btw). 
 
Spring 
Overall GPA: 3.3
Trig: 2.0
""Easy"" starting engineering  class: 2.0 

 Well, keep grinding. 

Summer: 
Overall Gpa: 2.8 
Physics 1: 1.5
Calc: 0.0 

Well, it was the summer. I seen worse.  Now, you're eligible to finally take the first programming class. Don't know. You'll might like it. So, instead of going to career fairs because I was embarrassed by my gpa even though I gotten interviews (and failed them) earlier, I tried working on my gpa. 

Fall: 
Gpa:3.0
Math: dropped it
Programming: 2.5 


Spring:
Gpa:3.25 
Calc: 2.5
Programming II: dropped it before it started, was too shell shocked. 

Instead, I went down the lists of alternative majors and started with classes for those. It went pretty good. I 4.0ed those majors classes, although I did somehow must have failed my philosophy exam and ended up with a 3.0. 

So, here I am. My options were to go either a ux route or an ""IT"" route. I'm leaning towards IT. But, my parents aren't thinking that it's ""good"" enough and that'll I'll be wasting the degree learning things that can be self taught. A lot of my fanfare has died down and they want me to reconsider a major I scratched out freshman year even after doing well in the related class. It's a business degree with a focus on the food industry. Lots of science and business. I did better in my science classes (3.5s) than I did in my math classes, so that's something. 

Here's how they compare: 

IT major: 
Starting rate:? 
Placement rate: 97% 
Time to finish: 33-40 more credits

Business major: 
Starting rates: 45,000
Placement rate: 99% 
Time to finish: 50-60 more credits

My fall and spring semester are full of classes from the ux major to the it major, though I'm leaning towards the IT major. The IT major is popular at my school, the ux major is just starting and the business one is the most highly regarded. But, I'll be basically choosing a whole new career path. Sure the classes looked standard enough and the stability seems a bit better, but I'm not sure at this point if I should just get any degree at this point and be done with it or if that's just defeat talking. Plus, I talked to one of my friends whose in a business major and she said they want to see an internship every single year, so I'll be behind in that regard.

982,Scoopwooppoop,1557626703,/r/college/comments/bnjyww/dual_major_or_single_multiple_minors_what_do_i/,"So, my situation.... I am a rising senior at this point at strong undergraduate school . I have a dual major, one in Biology (B.A.), and the other, High School Education (B.A.). I am on-track to graduate fine in my four years for both degrees and wrap up everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

My dual majors, both, do not excite me. In the meantime during college, bouncing around majors, I have collected quite a few psychology credits. I am actually \~slightly\~ interested in psychology (for now) and a minor. I have no clue what I would do or if I'd stay with it - I'm afraid I'd lose the passion when I actually get into it. Anyway, I would have to drop this minor due to time constraints if I went with my dual. 

&amp;#x200B;

**ALL MY PROBLEMS** are because I do not really like either of my majors or their fields.  I have switched around a bunch and I am still Pre-Med as well, but I am hesitant to pursue any of those post-grad. So, I am debating what is worthwhile and why I should continue with the stress of a dual major and all my ECs senior year.

&amp;#x200B;

1.) Keep Dual Major (drop minor in psychology, though).

2.) One Major (drop Education), and finish with B.A. Bio + 2 minors.

I would have a more ""free"" senior year if I dropped a major, and be able to make Education a minor and finish Psychology as a minor. 

&amp;#x200B;

I genuinely do not know what to do. I have been killing myself to decide and do not know what would be beneficial or most rationale. 

&amp;#x200B;

OPTION 1: Keeping Dual

* If my job is not in either field, it may still look more impressive to have two bachelors? (this might be dumb, so please say so.)
* It is hard to have worked for the dual and abandon it in my last year
* If I dropped Education, and for whatever reason wanted to become certified, the likelihood I do would be low (I think). I would most logically go for my masters to get certified as this makes the most sense in my state, I believe. But if I close the door now, I will likely not shoot out of the blue to go to graduate school in this field I dislike. I like the idea of teaching, hate the classes, but want the option?

&amp;#x200B;

OPTION 2: Dropping It

* On the other hand, I do not like education courses much. 
* Biggest thing to me... My senior year is all student teaching (7AM-3PM M-F) and that would upset me. I have had crazy stress to have my high GPA (all self-inflicted if I want grad school/best employment it would help) and I sacrificed SOME social life the last year. It may not be the rigor or extra work, but it the act of going to class and crushing my chances to be myself (seeing friends, going out my last year). 
* I can be purse the two minors in Education and Psych. 

&amp;#x200B;

It will be my senior year, and not knowing if I would pursue graduate school, do I opt to strap in another year for the degrees and try to be optimistic? Or should I drop one, probably be happier, but not have two bachelors? I might I do not want to exaggerate and the two majors do not kill me, but I would have more choices daily.

I had completed 2 semesters of college at a 4 year university before this, with a 3.76 GPA, honors college, etc. Even though I have autism, ptsd, GAD, amd ADHD, I got on meds, therapy, worked hard over breaks to learn what I wasn't taught in high school (like higher math) and have generally just been busting my ass for school.



I had attempted Calculus 2 for science and engineering majors once, the summer after my first semester. I withdrew due to a death in my family. I was told at my 4 year by advisors in my department (Computer Science) at our orientation to take Calc II at the local community college, they even readied the forms for us to enroll there immediately. My school publishes grade distributions, and hardly 40% pass calc 2 at my school. Naturally, I signed up at the community college.



I had no idea how disasterous the course would be. My professor was really disorganized, had never taught there before, and was very very strict on grading ( minus 5 if you forget + C, or write u before you plug in the original value for the integral and evaluate) I saw many classmates struggle, but I think some of them did well despite no curve. I got 60's and 70's on homework regardless of utilizing tutoring, having my answers checked by the tutors, etc. I could do the problems, but would make a minor mistake and lose 10 points.



I went to office hours almost daily, and was the only one who ever attended, I was very friendly and close with the professor. I really did try my best. I just couldn't perform to the professor's expectations. Now, I have a dilema. I cannot attend my 4 year school anymore, because it is too expensive, I don't get enough fin aid. They also don't have my intended major, Neuroscience, or any courses in it. I want to double major in Neuro and CS.



I sent out several transfer applications, but I know even if I am accepted, I will likely be rescinded because I got a C. Calc II is a pre-req for a few of the CS, Neuro, or Computational Neuroscience programs that I applied to. My cummulative GPA has now dropped to a 3.56, because I wasn't taking many credits, and got a B in another course (which I am grateful for, because most of my class failed, I will gladly take the B!)



I started crying earlier, because it feels like my one bad experience in a class will screw me over. I am going to have to attend this same community college due to costs, and my GPA there is now a 3.0, meaning I may not have access to the honors or research courses that I was planning for fall, and have seriously blown my shot at many of the univerisites I was interested in. They do not allow grade forgiveness unless the course was taken over 5 years ago, and their policy is that I cannot take the course again because I have now taken it twice, they will include the W. I did pretty well in Calc 1, I had a B and was close to an A for most of the semester, struggled with related rates and that one bad grade brought me down. I have gotten perfect grades in Statistics and Computer Science as well up until this point.




My transfer goal for next year was GA Tech or USC. I know admission for CS majors is higher for women at some schools, but I don't really put faith in that. I feel like I can do well in Calc 3, but I'm not sure if that will make up for this blunder. I have a 32 on the ACT, 33 superscore, and a ton of extracurricular activities and awards.



I've done research in high school and college, won two science fairs, presented my college research in AI and ML to a huge tech company, my contributions were included in a paper that was submitted for publication, I've been on student council in HS and college, I won a high level state writing award, AP Scholar, been learning music for a year and had several concerts, a few hackathons (including at harvard) I founded a GSA in high school and was president, volunteered a ton in HS doing STEM community service like bioblitz, tutorting, lecturing on research, leadership position in Japanese speaker's club in college, worked since I was 16, currently work in technical support for my uni, and have an upcoming research internship at a national lab for CS.



I also have a very unconventional background because I grew up really poor and living on my grandparent's farm. I have been almost entirely self sufficient since 16, one of my parents died from drugs/alcohol when I was really small and the other is severely mentally ill. This is a perspective that I talk about a lot in my essays, and how it has motivated me to become a researcher, and never give up my pursuit of learning.



Even with my extracurriculars and circumstances, do you all think that a C is going to be the nail in the coffin for a Neuroscience program or double major program? Will this bar me from entering good graduate schools? I've been so upset about this, wishing that I could have prevented it even though I studed vigorously and grinded practice problems like no one's business.",college,"I was planning on transferring, and recieved a C in a course.

First time poster here, just really in need of some guidance and don’t know where to turn so I hope this is the right place. A little backstory I’m a 23 y/o who excelled in high school, went to a local community college to save some money with the aspiration of later transferring to a 4-year school. Long story short, a collection of pretty unfortunate family and financial events happened starting at the end of my 2nd semester which put me into a depression and made my grades dip from 3.6 GPA to sub-2.0. Before my 2nd year began, I changed majors to something I thought would interest me more, but I also began working full time and 19yo me crumbled under the pressure and essentially failed out. A year later, I tried to go back to the same school and same classes, and dropped out (was still going through some heavy depression and anxiety) after realizing that I was not in the right environment to succeed. All in all, after about 5 semesters, I came out with maybe 15 credits and a horrid overall GPA. 

Now, 3 years later and after experiencing the job opportunities that are available with only a HS diploma, I feel I am in the right state of mind to get back on track but have no clue where to start or even what my options are. I just don’t have access to that sort of guidance in my life. I still live in the same city, but I feel that it is not somewhere that I can succeed. I feel that a fresh start elsewhere, perhaps even out of state, would be the best thing for me so I don’t get caught in old habits.

With the goal of hopefully being enrolled in classes this fall, what are my options given that I have a poor transcript at a local CC? Is my only option to go back there again? I don’t even know how to apply to bigger schools. I honestly don’t even know what questions to ask lmao. Just any help at all is appreciated 

TL;DR - poor transcript at local community college. Older now, feel I’m finally ready for college.

I had extreme doubt about whether I could even pass college algebra. I thought I was going to flunk out. After all, I never went to high school. I thought I wasn't good enough.

I tucked those thoughts away and tried my hardest to do everything I could to prove myself wrong. By the end of my first year I made the Dean's list twice and was awarded two scholarships.

Now, two years after I enrolled, I have been accepted to my #1 four year university and I am happy. I start a new job this week, am waiting to hear back after my second interview for an internship in NYC, and have a ton of social events planned.

The entire semester I had the same grades in every class. 2 A’s, 1 B, and 1 C. Consistent for 15 weeks. In the final week, one of my two A’s dropped to a mid level B due to the final exam, and my B fell to a C. The silver lining is my C went up to a B, but I’m still super disappointed.

991,aquanonymous,1556676116,/r/college/comments/bjbtsb/want_to_share_my_story_and_ask_a_couple_of/,"Hi guys! I'm not new to reddit, and lurk here a lot (this is an alt account). I wanted to share my college story with you guys and get some insight and different views from you all.

I graduated high school in 2011 at the age of 16. I applied and got accepted to the university in my area (I could not move out of state to live in a dorm because of my age), and was not advised about community colleges. Like, nobody told me about them at all. So, I started at the university in the fall full time (was taking 5 or 6 classes I think). I was also working a part time job. I had my license but had to share my car with my parents and rode my bike to and from school. I got a scholarship and a couple grants and had to take out 2 loans (my parents could not help me pay for school).

The first semester there was rough. My parents hadn't gone to college and weren't very supportive (they accepted what I was doing but didn't realize I needed help with homework and whatnot still). Because of this, I started not sharing anything with them and skipping classes. I think I passed maybe one of my classes. I was working and babysitting and was having a hard time doing my homework.

Second semester started and it was worse than the first. I felt very isolated and kept skipping classes. Without telling my parents, in late February, I withdrew from all of my classes and dropped out completely. I lied to my parents and kept going to campus and spending all day sleeping in the rec room (they would be furious with me). I then got a full time job elsewhere and told them that I had dropped out, and like I expected, they were furious.

So, I have spent the last few years working terrible dead end jobs. Cashier, caregiver, security guard. Hated all of them and realized that I wouldn't be able to do what I wanted without a degree.

And here I am. Two years ago, I successfully completed one semester of 3 classes (I don't remember how many credit hours) at the community college. I was working a full time job that allowed me to do homework and even leave for classes when needed. That job has since been made obsolete (site got closed), and I moved on with a new job. I've now been working full time for a little over a year in a dead end job that I absolutely loathe. I am unable to do homework here. I am taking two online classes right now. One of them, I'm doing alright in, the other one, I have no chance of passing.

So my dilemma is that I really want to go to school full time and not work full time. I am fortunate and able to do that. I have found some independent contractor work, and will work this crappy job until the fall semester starts. The community college that I'm going to is horrible with communication. They don't respond to my questions and concerns and it's annoying.

I want to go back to the university in my area. I owe them some money (I think a couple grand) from dropping out prematurely (I owe back the grant money). The loans are paid off. I have not received financial aid for the community college.

I know what you're thinking. Why would I want to go back to the expensive old university when the CC is so much cheaper? Because the university has good programs for my major, and the CC doesn't have a good equivalent transfer program (I want to do environmental science, and the CC doesn't offer that as a transfer program). I'm worried that if I do the transfer program (general science) the credits won't all transfer over or will not be useful and I'll have to retake a lot of credits at the university. 

What would you do? Would you work out a deal with the university and try to go back in the fall? Or would you pay it off incrementally and go to the CC until you get your associates and hope that it can transfer?",college,Want to share my story and ask a couple of questions about college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/bjbtsb/want_to_share_my_story_and_ask_a_couple_of/,1556694116.0

A little backstory:  
 I've always been bad with anything involving numbers. Since I was in elementary school I've always struggled and couldn't understand why everyone else was so much better than me when it came to math. Even simple things such as reading a clock I could never learn. My dad would teach me several times how to read one and I could never retain how to. Today I still can't read a clock. I've struggled with currency as well--today I get quarters, dimes, and nickels mixed up all the time and there's been several times when I was paying for something at a cash register and I gave the wrong cents. I was always in the lowest math group in primary school and had to get extra help. My dad would spend hours trying to teach me and I could not understand a lot of what I was learning, and it would get to the point where my parents would write the teacher notes to exempt me out of my math homework. I can't do math in my head at all, I still count with my fingers.   
 

Throughout middle and high school I had to come in extra hours all the time to get help with math. I'd always beat myself up because I thought I was really stupid since it never seemed like anyone struggled with numbers as much as me. The worse though was the SAT. I knew I was going to struggle in the math section so I convinced my parents to let me take a $200 prep class for it. I really wanted to do well and worked hard in studying from the class, and when the actual SAT came... I did tremendous. I don't want to say my exact score but it was very low in the math section. I was so upset because I felt like I wasted my parent's money and I was just stupid to spend extra time preparing for that section of the test and didn't even do a little good.   
 

So now to college. I thought it'd be best to take my general math class in my first semester to get it over with so I'd never have to worry about it again. I took Liberal Arts Mathematics which did not go well. I'd spend hours doing one problem on the homework in the library, and then spend the rest of the night working on the same problem. I'd start the homework the day it was assigned because I knew this would happen. It began to get too much for me, there were nights where it was 3 am and I was crying trying to do this homework and I couldn't understand it. I tried watching videos to help which did not help. I was scared to ask for help because I was told this was one of the easiest math classes. What made things worse was the class was at 8 am and I would have to get up at 5 am to get to class in time so staying up so late for homework all the time made me lose sleep. I'm quite the anxious person and sadly my mind was telling me that if I got help people would secretly be making fun of me because I can't understand simple concepts...  
 

So our first test went by and no surprise I bombed it. I finally talked to my professor about how I was struggling and was advised to drop the class for now, so I did. My first semester without a math class was so nice. I could actually get more sleep and work on stuff from my other classes better and I generally felt much happier not having to worry about math.   
 

As reg for next semester was approaching, I knew I needed to try to take a math class again. I decided to take Intro to Stats because a lot of people said that was an easy math class as well. I tried googling about struggling with math in college and came across some forums that talked about dyscalculia. I had never heard of dyscalculia before. I looked it up and was so surprised. Literally every symptom of it--from not being able to read a clock to counting with your fingers--applied to me. My math level is about that of a 3rd grader's as I learned. I never knew there was a learning disability for math and I really wish I had known earlier because I would not have beaten myself up as much as I've always had.   
 

A mistake from me was that I did not try to talk to my counselor after discovering this. Once again I got too anxious too. I reasoned with myself that I could see if I could get through stats. If what happened like last time did, I'd just drop the class and then talk to my counselor.   
 

So stats started and first I was actually doing much better. I didn't spend as long doing the homework as I did with liberal arts math. When the first test came up... I actually felt good! Never before did I feel good for a math test of all things. But then when the test came by I failed it with a 40%. I studied, made a note sheet since it was allowed for the test and still failed. The professor stated that in general alot of students didn't do too well on the test so I thought I could do better on the next one. I turned in all my work and studied a lot for the test. I started going to tutoring as well. I tried encouraging myself that I would do much better this time and I guess I did... I got a 58% which is another failed test. What made me feel worse was that the class average on the test was much higher than my score. That put me down so much.   
 

From there it got worse. I started struggling again on the homework like I had with my Liberal Arts Mathematics homework. I worked on my math so much that it began to affect my other classes as I started to do my homework from my other classes last minute so I could work on math more. I started to get real stressed and had no idea what to do. Tutoring wasn't helping me and when I talked to my professor it wasn't helping me. Everything I learned from them I could not retain.   
 

I was talking to one of my friend's about my situation and I learned from them that their boyfriend actually has dyscalculia as well, and they were able to get exempt from the general math credit from a psychiatrist. We go to the same school so obviously I'd have to do this then! I had a long talk with my mom, and we came to an agreement and I'm planning on seeing a psychiatrist this summer or fall. In the meantime I would just drop the math class.  
 

I made another bad mistake. I didn't realize there was a drop deadline or even what a withdrawal was. I couldn't drop the class for some reason and was confused but let it go. A few days went by and I stopped going to my math class because I thought I wouldn't be in it anymore soon. The days where I didn't go to stats felt good. I actually felt happy again in school and enjoyed being able to relax and do my other work without struggling with my math homework.   
 

I just learned earlier what a withdrawal is and I missed the deadline. I feel so stupid. I can't even drop the class now. I told my mom and she flipped out. I'm pretty sure I was failing math already because I had failed two tests and there is two left including the final. The next test is in a couple of days and with me missing a few classes already and not doing good in math in general I know for sure that I won't pass this test no matter how much I will study. My mom does not want me failing a class whatsoever. There's no way I'm going to pass this class. I want to bawl. I can't believe I did not understand withdrawing and I wish I dropped the class earlier. My mom wants me to go to my next stats class but I was so happy when I did not have to worry about math anymore. Now I am freaking out thinking about staying up all night trying to study and do one math problem on the homework that I won't even get right. I want to wait to go to a psychiatrist so I can get exempt from math. This is stressing me out so badly now that it's making me want to give up with college. Math is ruining college for me and I feel like I'll never graduate now. I finally set up a counselor appointment to talk about this but it isn't until next week. I'd rather just miss this class and test so I can relax and not stress out. My counselor appointment is after this test and I can't make it any earlier so I have no clue what to do. I don't want to make my mom upset by not going, but I'd feel so much better if I didn't go to stats. But it'll probably look bad if I have a failed class on my transcript right?

Until I had to schedule a meeting for advisement for my sophomore year. I scheduled my meeting with a different adviser who sent an email to me only to arrive the day of and find out he dropped me as his advisee that morning. Apparently he’s also a sec ed major and the school never gave me a new advisor for my new major. AWESOME right? So, without boring you with the details of going through the process of running around and getting a new advisor i’ll just lead you up to my meeting.

I come in and she’s talking to another professor I assume and she goes, “I’ve been waiting for you all day!!” (we had a meeting scheduled for 1:30 i dunno if it was like supposed to be funny or not?) 
Anyways I sit down and she pulls out a paper and starts listing off classes i’ve taken already until I point out Ive never taken intro to social work — she had the wrong paper — she didn’t even remember my name. She literally had no information about me on file. I had a bunch of stuff with me though in preparation to sit and talk about next year and all the things I was looking to do.

“Oh I have my transcript with me *ignored*, Oh I have my checklist (used for making sure you’re taking all the right classes) *ignored by her again*” 

Eventually she just writes down a list of classes I should take next year and says I may need to stay an extra semester. Done in 7 minutes and I felt like I was left with more questions than answers.

Is this how advisement meetings normally go? I mean this is technically my first advisement meeting considering I met with my former advisors for maybe a whole 6 seconds before leaving.

For a bit background, I'm at the end of my junior year and came into this semester just barely on track to graduate on time. Due to bad schedule planning during my freshman and sophomore year, I came into the year needing to take 18 credits (maximum amount) in 3 of my last 4 semesters to graduate on time. However, I dropped a class last semester which already put me behind, and now I'm on the brink of failing multiple classes which would basically guarantee me not being able to graduate on time.

All throughout college I've procrastinated and been incredibly lazy, but somehow I've managed to not only get by, but  also earn a 3.7 GPA in the meantime. No matter how much I've procrastinated and done the bare minimum in the past, I've been able to escape every class so far with a good grade because of my raw talent alone. This time that isn't going to happen. I'm going to go from my worst grade being a B- in my previous 5 semesters, to failing 2-3 classes this semester alone. The worst part is that the two classes that I'm going to fail are probably my two easiest classes, I literally just couldn't get myself to do the assignments or even show up to class half the time. The deadlines would pass and I kept telling myself I would do the next ones until it was eventually too late. Not only is my GPA going to tank but I'm also most likely not going to graduate on time, which will prevent me from graduating with all my friends while also putting me in more debt.  My motivation for school has always been low, but the panic caused by my situation finally lit a fire under my ass, however I had absolutely no idea where to start. I wrote an entire 10 page paper for one of the classes and submitted it late just for my professor to respond and tell me that I already failed the class and that I had done the paper for absolutely no reason. After that happened, I literally just felt paralyzed and the weight of everything just came down on me. The reality of how much I've wasted my potential and failed to apply myself AT ALL in school is crushing me, and now I've pretty much added a life crisis onto everything else that is going on.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently a freshman. During the Fall semester, I was a Chemical Engineering major. I had a really rough first semester of college emotionally despite getting good grades so I decided to switch to EE for the spring because I didn't want to give up on my dream of engineering. My mental health issues persisted and I dropped all but one of my classes to take a mental health break of sorts.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, I am doing SO much better. I've enrolled in courses for the summer and fall. I plan to major in either Biology or Anthropology with the intention of going to medical school. However, I've been feeling kind of blue lately. It started a couple weeks ago after I had to go to required engineering advising (my major is still Chemical Engineering since I haven't switched to anything yet). 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been going through 'what-if' moments a lot regarding Chemical Engineering. I wish I could go back and do it over again being the more mature person I am, I wish I would have been strong enough and taken advantage of more opportunities, I wish I would have fought for myself, etc. Engineering was really what I wanted to do and it matched the lifestyle I wanted, but I wasted that opportunity. Another issue is that I've lost my scholarships due to dropping below half-time. I sent an appeal letter but if I'm unable to get my scholarships reinstated, I honestly don't know if I will want to continue with college. I don't want to put my parents into more debt because of my mistakes. It's just horrible to think about how the main reasons I chose my university were due to its great engineering program and affordability compared to all of my other potential schools, but now both points are null.

This is the first year the college is offering the class and they didn't test it out. As such the first semester went horribly. 25% of the class dropped out or failed, compared to 5% from the previous class. Grades had to be curved by at least 10% and 70% of a final project was showing up to present it. Please keep in mind that this is an intro class. 

The first semester, the teachers tried to teach us some basic programming and basic engineering. They failed miserably, I came in knowing multiple programming languages and I had trouble following their lessons. The rest of the class was much worse off. For quizzes and tests and the like, they'd ask questions that they never taught us how to do. One of these was having us write a program with a nested if statement. We had only learned how to do an if statement in class that day and if they hadn't taken a programming class beforehand it is unlikely that the class would have realized that the problem required a nested if statement nor would they know how to write one.

Needless to say, this class was awful and when course evaluations came around me and everyone else called it out for the pos it was.

Unfortunately, the faculty in charge of this class didn't learn anything from the complaints of the students and decided to make this semester harder. This class only has the prerequisite of the previous class. They jumped straight into the middle of a random topic. I had never taken a class on it, most of the class hadn't either and there was no prerequisite for it. It went about as well as you'd expect. Failing to realize we had no idea what we were doing, they just jumped straight to another topic. A topic I didn't even know the name of until a friend saw my homework and told me. 

We just took an exam and the average was a 50, I have no clue what I am doing and the same can be said for the other about 1000 students in the class. I can't do this anymore and the teachers keep piling on homework and new topics with no regard for the fact that the majority of the class just failed their exam. They literally just gave a 20 point curve so that it looked like the class was doing fine.

I've tried talking to the person in charge of the class but he was very quick to place to blame on me for not watching their awful preclass videos, which I have watched. When I asked him about this being a weed out class, he said it wasn't and he was just trying to show us how hard college is. He just reminded me of a republicans trying to excuse trump for whatever dumb thing he's just done. His excuses made no sense and meeting with him was a waste of time.

I honestly can not deal with this class anymore and I don't see there being anything I can do considering the high ups in the school won't do anything to fix this class. I don't know what to do and am wondering if there is anything I even can do at this point.",college,Intro engineering class rant/help,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/b0g58x/intro_engineering_class_ranthelp/,1552459096.0

I’m retaking a general chemistry class this quarter. I will admit that I do struggle studying, but nevertheless i still put a lot of effort in despite having other classes to also worry about. My professor this semester is notorious for how strict he grades. I was informed that he will be responsible for creating the exams unlike every other semester where the exams are equally created by every chemistry teacher teaching chemistry that semester. I actually was relieved because i thought this gave me an advantage since my notes will be coming directly from him. I was so wrong. I get to my exam and nothing is like the notes, past exams i derived from other students and from my own previous experience taking the class, in class worksheets, online homework, and even the youtube videos i use in aid to study. I struggled even more than before this quarter since I had never experienced taking a professor who wants us to apply equations into problems that are worded or required to manipulate an equation in a different way than we have even seen or learned before. Mind you i have taken previous sequences of this course and I have never experienced exams to this extreme. I could be wrong, but to me that is unfair. None of the exams are equivalent in difficulty to the study guide (which are composed of past exams) or anything covered in lecture. I have spoken with other students in the class who are although doing better than me, have agreed that it is unfair and are surprised by the difficulty compared to classwork. Also, the fact that people were turning exams in CRYING really assured me that there was no way i was the only one struggling during the exam. I think this might stem from the fact that i am not mathematically gifted. I can learn and teach myself to do problems but only when i have seen them in a similar fashion but i find that i can’t figure out a problem if i have never seen it done a certain way before. This class has completely made me feel like a complete idiot. My self confidence and motivation to study dropped immensely and I have been extremely upset over this since I am on a tight schedule to graduate. I get such bad anxiety that I can’t even fall asleep at night because I am so worried about how i’m going to do in this class. So my question is, do i have a valid reason to bring this up to the school? If so, will the school even be able to do anything or would i even be able to request for a withdrawal grade instead of receiving a bad grade? Or is this my own responsibility? If you believe it is solely my responsibility to go beyond the textbook and materials provided then i would really appreciate tips on how I can possibly receive a good, not passing, grade in the class if i have to possibility retake it. I am willing to do whatever it takes. I am determined to achieve a grade I can be proud of but it seems like this is one of the only classes in my 4 years of college that i find impossible.

My husband and I have decided to go back to college together. Let me give you some background.

Husband is 26 and would be starting college at 28. He had a poor high school record/GPA. He joined the Navy, so the military will be paying for his schooling.

I am 22, and will be 24 when we begin. I graduated high school with a poor GPA as well, 2.7. I sat for the SAT's in high school and did pretty good from what I can remember. I sat for a few AP tests (Spanish scored a 2, Psychology scored a 2, and Statistics scored a 3). I have a lot of volunteer work stacked up from Girl Scouts to libraries to humane societies. I applied to a few schools, got in, but decided not to go for financial reasons. 

So, I joined the workforce. I did well in retail, even managing my own stores for a couple years. Then I met the husband online, he was stationed in Hawaii. We did a long term relationship for about a year before I dropped everything and moved out to join him. I got an office job in customer service, where I am excelling. We have recently gotten married (yay). 

Questions:

1. I'm pretty familiar with the college application process. Is anything going to be different for us since we're starting pretty late in the game?
2. Will letters of recommendation from professional references be accepted? Or should we stick to academic connections? 
3. Will we have to sit for the SATs or ACTs again?
4. Would we be better off doing CC before a 4 year?
5. I know some 4 year colleges require you live on campus for your freshman year, or even your sophomore year as well. Does anyone have first hand experience of working around that? We aren't really trying to do the dorm life and would rather stick together. 
6. Is it frowned upon to start college this late? I'm a little nervous about the optics of everything.

1023,milayamoya,1552113670,/r/college/comments/az0o13/soph_prestigious_school_when_to_take_a_break_when/,"Hi everyone. I am a 20 y o at a high-ranking U.S. college. I am in the minority of student on full scholarship, and the even tinier minority of homeless students at my school. I became homeless at 18 due to an abusive home life situation.  I had a rough childhood and I never really felt like my life was my own. College was my one shot to get away from it all, and I was happy to go. 

Now after two years of living in nice dorm housing, eating well on caf food, and working during breaks, something is still amiss. School is hard. I can’t stand most of my wealthy and sheltered classmates. My classes feel abstract and disconnected from real life, and there is only one professor here who I really connect with. 

At the end of my freshman year, I made friends with a group of local kids (ages 21-25) and they are a great support system. They do a lot of protesting and activism about social justice causes— most of them have only finished high school or dropped out of college. I feel like they are living the life I want to live. I am passionate about the same things and want to fight for something that matters, not just read and write about it. Like I said before, I feel like I’ve never really had a life that was my own, and I crave freedom from my classes and studying. 

I’m thinking about taking a break for part of the school year next year to work on activism and protesting with my friends. Two of my friends own a farm, a large house not far from my school, and small business that I can work for.  

I can’t help but feel like I’m throwing away my opportunity to go to college. Even so, how I see it, when I graduate I’ll be working a minimum wage job with or without a diploma. People say a degree will open doors in life, but I just don’t see it. I’m not getting a STEM degree, I am an African American Studies major. 

I am looking forward to a break from college. I question the value of a degree and I crave the chance to live a life without stress and abuse. 

Also, My student loans are currently at 8,000$ and will be at $16,000 when/if I graduate. 


TLDR: homeless kid at a fancy college, feeling completely disillusioned, want to take a break/drop out, I am unsure financially it would make any difference from getting a degree for 18,000$ of debt 

My questions for you are, do you think these are valid reasons for someone in my situation to leave school for a while/forever? Do any of you feel disillusioned with college?

1025,wicaksana,1551921842,/r/college/comments/ay6rw5/first_post_hate_my_life/,"I feel like shit. I've been in college 3 years now and changed my area of study 3 times. I keep trying to keep up with the friends I look up to, they're great students, very deliberate, they're in school for a purpose. Lately though, whenever im hanging out with them, I can't help but be aware of how far behind I am. I'm older than both of them but I still don't have my shit together, I don't know what I want to do with my life, don't know what I should go to school for. I don't know what I'm good for, I'm not aware of any passions I possibly have. I've been craving for a win, something to feel good about. I take classes that I think I would enjoy or would be of some worth to me. I usually get bored, frustrated and confused, and never have enough time to catch up. I recently dropped a social research class, thinking I got too much on my plate. I just feel guilty and embarrassed about it tho. When I'm with my smart friends, even though I known them for a couple years now, I still feel like the outsider, like I'm not good enough to be their friend. I want so badly to be able to impress them dammit.

I feel like I'm looking in all the wrong places for meaning and worth. For the last 3 years I've been betting on school paying off. So far it hasnt. For the last year I've been investing in my girlfriend, trying to build it into a happy successful relationship. So far that's not working out either, we still suck at communicating and making each other feel loved, well I think maybe I'm ok with giving her the attention she needs, but I feel she doesn't deliver on the love I need. I feel drained. 

In January I got promoted to manager at the coffee shop I work at. Sometimes work makes me feel good if it's busy and I'm working hard. It's only busy maybe 30 percent of the time. The rest of the time it's dead there and I imagine what it would be like working job that provides lots of hours and better pay. But I made a commitment to run this shop, I can't leave, not now at least. 

There's this motif of me getting stuck in situations I don't want to be in. I want to cut it all off. I dropped a course. I dropped out of this mind numbing dnd group. The desire to cut things out of my life is so embedded in me, I fucking shaved my head. What the fuck am I doing with my life.  Why am I wasting my time. I so badly want to drop everything I'm doing to discover what I really love, and do those things instead. This has been going on for so long, I feel so deprived. I'm becoming hateful and I'm pushing my friends and gf away. Also my cat hates me, I have no form of comfort, none from my cat, not from my friends who pity me, not from my gf who doesn't take me seriously. My family only tells me what to do, they never seek to understand what I'm experiencing.

So, I'm a 25 year old female in my masters degree program for city planning and its my second semester/quarter. I have depression, anxiety, and fibromyalgia so I have an accommodation letter from accessibility centre (unfortunately just got my mental health not physical) and all my professors have a copy. I essentially don't have motivation or energy to even brush my teeth let alone write 30 page paper or commute 2 hours to campus. hence the letter. I can eventually write those papers but with more time given to me rather than the like 2 or 3 weeks. Last time i tried to go to class i was in tears on the bus because I felt so lifeless and zapped of energy.  I also go to therapy so im not just sitting here, i'm trying to get better so i don't have to be like this anymore.   


One prof already said that despite my letter ive missed too many classes (3 out of 6) so i should just drop her course........ as someone with mental health issues that put me so. down.   


I'm now dropped to part time student status thanks to her because I need 3 classes minimum to be considered full time, and she was my third class.  


Today I have class for one of my remaining classes but I'm not going because i can't move. mentally im dissociated. physically im in pain. I missed last class too, and a couple before that. This professor told me I can hand in my assignments late, and he was actually my advisor last year so he knows I hand in things incredibly late and never show up but still get things done. But for some reason Im worried because im sitting here thinking all the worst things  


he's in class now thinking ""of course she's not here again"", or thinking im a shit student or a failure, thinking i'm no going to graduate, or im a waste of class space. Or because I haven handed anything yet that he thinks i never will and im a shit student. I already get these vibes from my classmates and it makes me feel even more depressed being seen as a failure. So thinking my professor is also thinking these things is really making my depression even worse.   


So basically thanks to anxiety i care very much what people think of me esp when they think im a failure, and depression makes me dwell on it and beat myself up and call myself the worst names. In addition to this I think he's gonna give up on me and fail me. Its starting to drive me insane. I can't stop thinking about anything else and its draining and I just want to sleep.   


I want to tell myself logically he a) doesn't give af or b) knows ill get my stuff done and isn't judging me. but its so hard for me to believe that and these thoughts are consuming me.   


I don't know what to do. these thoughts just make it even harder to start assignments or go to class. i feel so hopeless. 

**TLDR;** I have depression, anxiety, and fibromyalgia so I miss a lot of school and hand in assignments late because most of the time i'm shut of physically, mentally or both.  I have an accommodation letter for these reasons that my profs have copies of, but i cant help but think they think i'm a failure because i'm never in class, and are going to flunk me before I even have a chance to hand things in. These thoughts are consuming me and making my depression and anxiety worse, which is in turn making it even more difficult for me to go to school or do assignments.

So I'm 19 years old and in my second year of community college and to say I hate it is an understatement. I've always had bad anxiety over school and almost dropped out of high school. I ended up being home schooled for half of it. I thought things would get better when I got rid of the social aspect of it, but school itself just gives me anxiety.

I currently take two classes a week while working full time to support myself. I'm in a major that I thought I was passionate about, but I have to get my masters, and the thought of being in school for god knows how long is exhausting to think about.

I feel like I'm wasting my time and energy with something I never wanted to do. No one I work with has a degree that they use, and I feel like regardless of if I finish school I'll be in the same place.

Suddenly became aware of what you can do or achieve or rather, finally felt more matured? Just the view of the world suddenly opens up kind of feelings?

Anyways, the story is, I've been to 3 Universities believe it or not, 1st Accounting and Finance, 2nd Computer Science, 3rd Games Technology. Cardiff U, Open U (Online), Bristol U. Failed or dropped out of them all and left with debts.

I went to the Universities that I could go to with the grade I have and I have no idea what I wanted to do with the courses I've chosen but just want to be ""successful somehow"" by graduating which didn't turn out so well. LOL. Yeah...

So what happened in those conventional Universities is that I couldn't make any friends (not even those in my dorm) and starts to skips lectures then eventually get into depression and stayed in my room without my parent or anyone knowing my situation. Then I failed all the modules and dropped out.

My Chinese parent weren't happy, life gets more miserable and became super isolated and suicidal. This ""rebirth"" feelings kicks in after a few months of crying to sleep, wake up crying and back to sleep... I became somewhat hopeful and went to see people that could help me to help myself. Yeah, seriously. So I went to seek a few psychiatrist and some psychotherapy and discovered I was simply socially inept and there was nothing I could do about it because it's caused by how my upbringing was. 

Yeah, I got over that now. Now I want to move on, with extreme determination (at least I believe that's how I feel)

This is where I need helps for:

I'm an extremely ignorant and undisciplined 21 years old child. I've never once studied in my life and I couldn't figure out how to study in the Universities I went to, for example, what do you even write down in your note book when your professor is lecturing. What exactly do I do to achieve good or top end? What I've done in high school are not skipping any classes and memories some materials a day before exam and play video games and grades weren't good but passable.

I have PhD in Psychology in mind right now (believing I'm smart enough for it), I have no idea what is the process between Undergraduate and PhD. I want PhD because I actually likes learning and I've realise how much I don't know, it's actually driving me insane. I think I realised how hard it is to get through master degree and PhD and how costly it can be but I don't really know what exactly you do in the process. Am I being too naive still? I'm actually scared that I'm setting myself up to fail again.

I'm quite optimistic and thinking of helping society in some way in the future and hopefully be able to discover something new about human psychology or philosophy and also works as an clinical psychologist to help various troubled people to open a path that's closed for them. (Like how I am)

Lastly, I'm planning to redo English, Biology, Psychology and maybe Religious Study/History for the grades required for studying Psychology in University. Is this smart to do? Or any other way on approaching this?

PS - Even thought I said ""rebirth"", people doesn't change that easily, at least not me. What I'm doing right now is motivating myself to read, learn to read books, as much as I can and try to tune down my hours on video games and get some exercise going and maybe join some club/sport to socialise with people.

She has no information for the FAFSA even though she is technically a dependent so we already went through a long process together so that she could even pay for school in the first place, but now she's facing the problem of her GPA. My friend attended college for one semester, but a few weeks before it was over, her grandmother decided she didn't deserve college or some nonsense, and made her leave (she also kicked her out of the house).

1042,Cado7,1549413223,/r/college/comments/anktm2/advice_from_a_first_generation_transfer_student/,"The kid messaged me on my universities sub. I gave him this advice and I thought I'd share with others. First generation college students are not as prepared as everyone else. Especially if you didn't do well or had a gap between high school and college. 

I was a dumbass in high school and had a 2.6 GPA. I have a 3.6 now, and I'm getting a neuroscience degree for reference.

The mistakes I made at some point during the 4.5 years I've been here were...

1. Not going  to office hours. If you have a question or somethings not clear, go. If  you don’t have a question and want to pick your professors brain, form a  relationship, just shoot the breeze, go. 

2. Man up and make a point of  contact in classes that you think you’ll need it. I personally learn  best with group study so the past year or so I’d send a message to  everyone on Carmen with a group me link and use that group chat to discuss lecture or meet up to study. If you don’t want to message the  whole class, ask someone around you for their number. 

3. Get internships and research experience. No one told me you basically need undergrad  research and now I’m graduating at 25 with none. 

4. Make connections!  Those people in your study groups will go on to get jobs in your field. I  only made two friends in my major, but I’m glad I have them. I texted them recently letting them know I was looking for a job in case any  opportunities came their way that they could forward to me.

 5. Every.  Point. Counts. Don’t beat yourself up if you have a bad exam or make a  mistake, but NEVER go in with the mindset of “oh it’s fine I don’t have  to try on this cause it’ll get dropped/I can still make a 93%” 

6. Join clubs. I was the president of a student org for a few years, but it had  absolutely nothing to do with my major. If you have time, find an org  that’s relevant and academic. Make connections there too.

7. Try not to  let the imposter syndrome get to you. These 4.5 years I thought I was borderline r\*\*\*\*\*\*\*/had a learning disability. I took an IQ test and got tested for dyscalculia (math dyslexia) and I was actually above average. 

I still hate myself sometimes, but we all do. Don’t yeet  yourself off a parking garage (we’re notorious for it, if you didn’t  know). Just be proactive, show up, and do what you need to do. I’ve gone  to a bunch of random networking events that were advertised, LOATHING  actually going, but coming out of them with more confidence than I went  in with. Good luck, buddy.

Honestly, I'm really just overwhelmed by the entire class. I go to class every single time, pay attention, no messing with my phone or talking to my neighbors, etc, but somehow, I'm just not getting it. It's one of the first real, college-level classes I've gotten to take since I finished my ""remedial"" semester before this one. I'm generally not very good with math that doesn't have a solid x+y=z format, and word problems are literally my worst enemy. It was the section I did the worst in when it came to my algebra class.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a first generation college student, 26 years old, and I'm going back to college after two failed attempts when I wasn't mature enough to take my studies seriously. My father graduated high school, no college, and my mother dropped out in the 8th grade. My planned major is nursing, and I'm currently doing my pre-requisites before I apply for the nursing program at the end of the fall semester to begin in the spring of 2020. I had two college-level courses my first semester, so I'm not totally blind to the fact that 100 level classes are more difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if it's my teacher who is bad at teaching, because the more I talk to other students, the more I get the feeling that I am not the only one having issues understanding the material. I go into class with a positive attitude and write down absolutely everything on the board and follow along with the in-class assignments, which are 8-10 questions on the material learned in that day's lesson. I seem to do well during class, but as soon as I get home, it's like the information went \*poof\* and it's gone. I'm even able to explain the questions to my neighbors when we have free homework time(not often in the last week), so that's what really bugs me too. Reviewing my notes does not help, because once I look back at them, it's clear they don't really contain any real information to help me solve problems on my own. It's all just really vague things on the subject, and it's not even relevant to the questions on the homework. I've tried Khan Academy and googling and I just. don't. get. it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am so scared that I am going to fail this class because that means I have to take it again. I have spent 3-4 hours/day every day trying to get through last Tuesday's homework assignment of 26 questions and no matter what I do, I just can't figure it out. It does not click in my brain. I'm on question 5 and 3 of those are wrong because I decided to skip the question for the next one to see if I could get that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm feeling super discouraged...I plan on scheduling some one-on-one tutoring in our math lab and another tutor through a program I'm in at my school, but I'm really scared they won't be able to explain it in a way I will get. I have a test on Feb 11, and I am DESPERATE to pass it. I want to pass this class. Even if it's just a C, that's fine, I figured this class can't hurt my GPA too awful bad if I do get a low grade, but still.

I recently transferred from a CC to a 4-year. I got placed into remedial math when I was at CC which they broke up into two courses. I barely passed those with a C. I was actually supposed to take algebra the summer before I transferred, but the 4-year needed my final transcript super early. 

This past fall I got placed into 5 courses. Two of which were corporate finance and algebra. I took my first exam in algebra and I bombed it really bad. So I dropped it before midterm. Then I registered for spring and told my advisor I wanted to retake algebra over the summer since I’m so bad at it. She was okay with that. 

Then I get an email literally a week before spring semester started from the advising department. They told me because I’m officially a junior now and I haven’t taken algebra, they have placed my account on lockdown and I can’t register for next fall until I take this class. 

I know that I have to take it. I just don’t know why I’m so bad at algebra. I’ve taken macro and microeconomics, both accountings, and now corporate finance and I finished them all with As. But I just can’t fucking get algebra concepts for the life of me. 

Now that I’m a junior, I’m officially a student of the business school of my university. I have a mandatory meeting with my new advisor tomorrow.

I'll start off by saying I am not in a bad situation at college. I'm just about to graduate from community college with an A.S. in Environmental Science and a Certificate in GIS. I've made Dean's list almost every semester. I live at home with a supportive family, and have some great friends. I was working my whole way through college but recently quit my job for a GIS internship. Sounds pretty good right?

The thought of transferring to a university next fall stresses me out way too much even though it shouldn't. I've gotten into all of the schools I've applied to, and have automatic scholarships for my great GPA and the fact that I am graduating from CC. What makes me pull my hair out is the fact that every single university I could go to would make me spend at least 2.5 - 3 years to get my bachelor degree, even though I already have 90 credits. I don't want to spend 6 years total getting an undergrad when my friends are graduating in 3 or 4. I feel like I've been screwed over by the CC system.

I'm tired of school, and I absolutely hate my economic dependence on my family. I want to continue my education, but I have lots of trouble justifying the cost and time commitment of an undergrad degree for it's worth. If anything, I'd rather just get a full time job that would pay for me to take one or two classes a semester.

After highschool I thru hiked the Appalachian Trail (yes, I paid for it myself), and last summer joined an Alaskan trail crew between semesters. During those experiences, I've met some of the happiest people in the world who either never went to college, or found it a waste of time or money and dropped out. I am extremely jealous of them and other people that are not pressured by family to go to college. 

In short, I know I'm smart and capable enough to do well in college, but I absolutely hate the academic lifestyle. I want to be able to start living my life instead of sitting in lecture halls. I'm tired of having no money, no time, and being generally unhappy.

My main concern is that if I apply for the college I want to go to and get accepted, but don’t get enough money in student aid or get accepted without knowing how much I can get, will I be stuck paying for the courses or will I have the option to back out?

I quit playing baseball last spring so I could join the Marine Corp. I was waiting on childhood ADHD wavier which I took from 2006-2009.

By now I've been enrolled in 6 different colleges, and only one of them has satisfactory results.  After reading a number of posts of how transcript omission is severe academic misconduct, and talking about it with a close friend and counselor. I've decided to come clean of all my shortcomings, saw it as a step to maturity, and owning up to one's own mistakes.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been lurking here for a while since my college days and I see lots of posts here detailing both the good and bad about their college lives and the inquiries on how to make bad situations better.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Your productivity velocity/Average Task completion for subject=Necessary time sacrifice.

Here's a very simple and easy way for most people to know how much time they need to devote to a single assignment. Measure your time to completion. Time how long it takes you to get it done. Try to comprehend how hard it was for you during the process and see if you can speed up your overall time through tricks and flow enhancing techniques. These can be striking out all the easiest questions so you save all the time to the hardest--not only for multiple choice but for those I.D. short answer questions that you can definitely get points on when you define the term for each and every one of them instead of stalling on trying to come up for an example for a single one. Knowing your working throughput makes you able to accurately set up timeboxes and deadlines to help you measure your overall time and set up cushions.

&amp;#x200B;

Also to help you know when to stop studying.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, you heard me right, stop studying.

&amp;#x200B;

I came from a high-level semi-international level Chinese school that did nothing but death-march kids through college-level material in 7-8 courses for years so the ones that made it out of high school got good by committing to two choices. We got good at suffering more than anyone else, riding at exams with eldritch curses vomited forth from our lips driven by fears ancestral disappointment and utter destruction or, and this is less common, we got really good at the metathinking and mechanics of doing the work. The cost of learning advanced trig is 4 days of hard brutal cramming. The cost of memorizing all the types of questions for the predictable exam is 4 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

Unless you plan to be a master, I suggest you don't obliterate your own minds limited willpower. And considering that most people don't come from ridiculous studying death marches since they could write, you don't have the drilled and practiced ability to suffer eternally while not losing any productivity. This is not a slight against you nor a benefit to us. It's just how you were molded by your environment and practice. There are benefits and losses to both. I explain the damage that death marching does soon enough.

&amp;#x200B;

If there is one idea that did miracles for me in college for my studies, its the concept of minimal time and effort spent to get an A-.

&amp;#x200B;

Spend much more than what is required on average, that bleeds over to other subjects, your hobbies, your clubs, and your career development time.

&amp;#x200B;

That's not a good thing. That's time waste. Time waste will gut you and bleed you good and fast when the assignments come avalanching down at the end of the semester.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get buried or you spend the rest of your time spraying crap back to your professors to crawl your way out.

&amp;#x200B;

This leads to my next point.

&amp;#x200B;

2. You don't have free time, you have expendable time.

&amp;#x200B;

Timebox your hours by the week, and absolutely by the day. If you enjoy having a spot of fun go for it. It's important to lubricate your brain and oil your fortitude with rejuvenating activities. Know that you have to include some time for yourself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Trust me, you'll need it.

  
Often, I advise people to plan around their necessary time sacrifice for academia because that's a constant but day to day, that's up to you. If you don't have class on Monday and you want to go hog-wild running around buck-naked with an airhorn clenched between your cheeks, go for it. Just know that time will be coming out of your weekly allotted time. And potentially a restraining order.

&amp;#x200B;

Students often joke about the social life, studying, sleeping triangle. You can choose two. Or if you're an engineer, just one. This is true for the average student perhaps, but you are not aiming to be the average student. I hope. Try to keep an average of your sleeping time. If you feel most rested from 11-6, go for that and do that consistently. If you party wild and hard, I recommend building a routine of power naps that will keep you charged across your days. Keep your tanks fueled or prepare to stall and break. 

&amp;#x200B;

Factor this into your timebox as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Hobbies, clubs, careers, and relationships are major concerns that must be addressed as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

My concept for this part: pick your priorities in the timebox but don't forsake all the others entirely. 

&amp;#x200B;

Specialize, but remain cross-functional. This will save you when it comes time to build a life as an adult.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Prepare for the future and accept the chaos.

&amp;#x200B;

""Your future is bright.""

&amp;#x200B;

This platitude is blasted at you more times than your roommate towards your shower curtains when they think you're not watching--side note, when living together set clear boundaries but always be prepared to bleach everything and have an out. 

&amp;#x200B;

It sounds nice.

&amp;#x200B;

Feels good.

&amp;#x200B;

Is entirely bullshit.

&amp;#x200B;

You have no idea how your life is going to go. At all. 

&amp;#x200B;

To counter this quote with a quote from Unforgiven, ""Deserve's got nothing to do with it.""

&amp;#x200B;

You don't get what you deserve. You don't get what you work for sometimes. Keep your mind on the infinite game rather than the limited one. Know what is true to you and what you want to be working for. And if you don't, accept the discomfort knowing that you are in the majority and aren't behind the curve. 

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, there is no curve.

&amp;#x200B;

So many of my classmates from high school, boys and girls who were monsters of art and science, flunked out of college. The material was easy to them. They could death march forever. But there were not prepared for the freedom. And they lacked the self-discipline.

&amp;#x200B;

Frankly, too many of us came to college to early, I would argue. Just because you can study forever doesn't mean you will. The allegory of the cave makes sense here with the cave being constant studying and the light outside being self-management and independence. In high school, what is pitched is that you have no choice. People will ride you like a rented mule in a field of snakes. Your parents, your teachers, your student leaders. They own you, on some level. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then you get to college and no one truly cares.

&amp;#x200B;

Then you learn that life isn't about managing stress or pressure if you're used to that. It's about managing the apathy.

&amp;#x200B;

This destroys kids who, by all other metrics, should be ready.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of this, just because you're good at death marching and doing academics doesn't mean you're ready for life. A few classmates that graduated along with me went into rehab.

&amp;#x200B;

Drugs. Alcohol. Depression. Loneliness. This is common. You think you can suffer forever. Until you can't.

  
They were high achievers but they broke down and gave up right after the finish line because in their minds, it was all for nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

They went to school because mom and dad told them to. Or just because it was expected of them. Or they did majors they didn't care about.

&amp;#x200B;

You need to find your own way. Find your own reason. Spend time trying to understand that. The world has very little meaning to it. Existence, if you aren't religious or spiritual, doesn't mean anything beyond 42. That's an absolute standpoint. You're looking at the relative.

&amp;#x200B;

Be pragmatic with your mind and soul. Let's not bullshit ourselves here, if you hate pre-med or accounting but think that the job is going to make you happy, you got another thing coming. The money might make you happy but let me tell you, after a certain threshold when it gets to be enough, you stop working for the money and instead for the task. 

&amp;#x200B;

Coincidentally, this is also how wage-slaving works. It's low engagement low pay work sold to you as experience or with the potential to make you rich. If you have to do these jobs, do them briefly but just leave. Loyalty is a desiccated corpse these days for a good majority of the companies that I have trained within. You are not obliged to suffer. Apologies for the tangent but it is necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to college, keep in mind the fun of these years is about the journey. Education is about more than books. Understand yourself. Know your limitations. Know your flaws. Know your strengths. Try to know them as objectively as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some hard truths might come at you, like the foundations of self-loathing for example. I learned during college that though I hated myself at times for the wrong reasons, I deserved that hate by all accounts because I didn't address the core issue. It's like beating yourself without improving so you can have more room to beat yourself later. Of course you're going to hate yourself its a self-perpetuating cycle. 

&amp;#x200B;

Engage your flaws on your terms. Engage the darkest moments on your terms. Don't think about yourself when you're in a depressed mood. Don't make choices when you're down. Be on the offense. Especially with yourself. Build on yourself. Break down yourself. Rebuild yourself. 

&amp;#x200B;

But do it while you have control.

&amp;#x200B;

No one ever won a fight by taking a punch.

&amp;#x200B;

If you need help, find it with professionals but also with friends and family if you can. The wholeness of support can drill into our very pattern driven minds that we can get better if by osmosis alone.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Don't be afraid to walk away.

&amp;#x200B;

I finished college with a GPA of 3.8. I was a writer for several clubs, the vice-president for one, a president for another, a division-three athlete, while working part-time. I finished two majors in four years.

&amp;#x200B;

You might have bad grades. You might be thinking of dropping out. You might have already dropped out.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not worth more than you. I mean this objectively and subjectively. My success does not correlate to your failure. The truth is, with the vastness of experiences and our lives, I don't know what you went through to get here. You probably don't know me. Hell, I could have been lying this entire time and just been a sapient walrus learning human behavior online in hopes of preparing for the eventual uprising led by our lord and sovereign Jamie Hyneman. However, comparing your darkest moments and your missteps to my victories and glories is a lot like saying I won while you tripped briefly on a set of stairs. A set of stairs that extends forever.

&amp;#x200B;

Know this, you are not done unless you say you are. This isn't some motivational speech bullshit. It's not me trying pump you up. It just the truth. The wheel turns on. The show goes on. The highlight reel ends.

&amp;#x200B;

I just told you all about how well I was doing in school. What I didn't tell you was following the end of college, I felt like doing nothing because I had no goals for myself for the future because I didn't care much for me and so I just sat in a dead-end job for half a year because.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I was made for bigger things but that's not what always happens. Sometimes things just go sideways. But they keep going.

&amp;#x200B;

The point is, if you truly, definitely don't want to stay in college, that's okay too.

&amp;#x200B;

You have to live for yourself eventually. Make your own choices. Being an adult is about taking responsibility for your own life. Nothing more. The choice is up to you.

&amp;#x200B;

If the disappointment of others makes you deny your own will, know that the price of that is going to be paid by you. They will not suffer being you in misery. They will, however, complain regarding why you are miserable, as I have observed with multiple peers and their friends who are parochial if I am to describe them gently.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'd like to end this tentative smattering of advice with a shameless plug for a book series, The Stormlight Archive. Yes, it's fantasy. Yes, it feels like an anime sometimes. But even if you don't like those things, I implore you to read a single chapter in the third book, Oathbringer, titled, the Girl Who Looked Up. It helped a few people I know out of some dark places. Maybe it might do some good to you.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, happy semesters and good luck.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, focus on the journey before the destination.

1062,kimmbelly,1547202949,/r/college/comments/aeu5nl/i_took_a_break_from_school_but_im_still_lost_on/,"First off, thank you to whoever takes the time to read this. To make a long story short, I started Freshman year great and liked being busy, I was attending classes and working part-time. Eventually, I started slipping, I skipped my classes and early last semester (sophomore year) I dropped all but one of my online classes to focus on fixing my issues and my mental health. During this break, I started working nearly full time but decided that I wanted to continue school. I decided that ultimately it would benefit me more than not. I also hated that I was wasting my own potential, even though I was working. When I would start burning out at work or when I would have some time off, I felt stagnant and that I should be doing something so I started planning.  

I have interests in many different careers but they all are semi-related (generally conventinal or enterprising jobs) so I wanted to major in something that is adaptable/ versatile. Originally, I majored in psychology but then I felt that business management would be best as it seems like a good foundation and it fits well with the future careers I looked into. Eventually, self-doubt had gotten to me and the thought of trying to get into business school with my academic standing worried me and I was already behind in many of the requirements. I know now that it will take me a bit longer to obtain my bachelor's but I also want the time to be proportional with the payoff.

Currently, I'm majoring in General Studies with an emphasis in Economy and Industry. I'm enrolled in two in-person classes and three online classes and I'm still working part-time. The ultimate question I'm struggling with is should I continue with going to school traditionally with my major in General Studies or should I attend online school (Arizona State) funded by my employer and major in something more concrete like business management. I was supposed to figure this out during my mental break last Fall but I've just been hesitating/ sort of in denial. Now, as I kind of threw myself back into classes I figured that I needed to sort this out now rather than later and fall into the same loop as last year.

It feels like I got sucked into an elaborate and socially acceptable scam. 

It wears down on my mental and physical health having to worry about how I’m going to pay the massive tuition bill (and I’m even going to a cheaper university) and how I’m going to fit all of the course work into my schedule along with work and trying to find SOME time to be a person. It honestly has felt like the worst decision that I’ve ever made. 

I probably would have dropped out years ago, but I had a scholarship that covered most of my tuition the first four years (I’m a 5th year) and part of the fine print was that if I dropped out I’d have to pay all of it back..so that’s where I am.

I've seen way too many stories of people on [r/college](https://www.reddit.com/r/college)  and all across the internet especially from people in my country the  U.S. expressing their struggles in college and in many cases people who  are unfit for college in general come on here and explain all of their  problems and frankly I just get sick of seeing all of this. I have two  older brothers one of which is 36 (he entered at 26 or something  starting in community college whereas he originally entered college in  2000 at age 18 but dropped out in his first semester) years old and has  spent about 10 years in university (I bet hes' in a lot of student loan  debt by now) first as an electrical engineering major then a computer  science major and then a information technology major and he's the  biggest loser I've ever met in my life and I am grateful everyday he's  not my biological brother.

My  other older brother is now 26 and he actually graduated from a  respected university with a political science degree but decided not to  become a lawyer despite getting an excellent LSAT score and ended up  moving back with his parents because he couldn't pay the rent even with  his roommate and took a job at CVS for a while and was even promoted to  manager at CVS very quickly but even so was only making $12,000 a year  and he did this because he felt it was unfair for him to live at home  with mom and dad without a job. He then quit his job and wrote a book  and published it on Amazon and now he is learning programming to get  into machine learning to work with AI working with his college roommate  who is now in law school becoming a lawyer to start a company in the  hopes of making a lot of money. My brother graduated with $12,000 in  student loan debt despite going to an in-state university and having mom  and dad help paying for his living expenses having left the house and  moved away to go and study. He graduated on-time in four years but even  so he hasn't amounted to much of anything in life and it is nothing  short of sad and disappointing. It shows that even if you do graduate  from college on-time and supposedly do everything right college does not  guarantee you a happy and successful life and career.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason so many young people are struggling is not just the expenses of university but also the uncertain job market and the varying levels of likely success people are to have depending on the field they get into. These days, some college majors and career paths are just not reasonable options for most people unless if they meet certain prerequisites for it to be recommendable such as becoming a lawyer in most Western countries which is flooded with law graduates. We don't ever give students an entire course about the realities of working in various different careers, the requirements to get that education, the job market, and how to determine what we want in life and what will make us happy. I know that 100% possible but instead other things are prioritized over all of those things. I personally am tempted to create a course for Udemy and Youtube for young people on how to figure out what they want to do with their life and picking a career because no one else will do that because no one cares about the young people and the struggles we have to deal with just to even make it in life!

&amp;#x200B;

Why  can't we accept the fact that college is not for everyone and that the  system for college is fundamentally broken? Don't you think that for  some people they should never go to college under any circumstances and  in many cases college is in fact a bad idea especially if you don't know  what you want to do with your life or go to a bad university or a  stupid degree program that is an absolute waste of time and money not to  mention the [$1.5 Trillion Student Loan Debt Crisis the U.S. is in Now?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2018/06/13/student-loan-debt-statistics-2018/#5577c307310f)

1069,StardustNyako,1546094948,/r/college/comments/aalquv/sharing_my_college_journey_in_hopes_that_it/,"Soo, I've had a non- traditional sort of journey, attempting to get through college. I debated whether or not to share this and was inspired by recent personal threads people have posted here to do so. Please understand though, this is word vomit and won't be well structured.

Soo, I went to an ultra competitive magnet school just to learn Japanese cause, I wanted to watch anime without subs.

Really I didn't have plans for high school or b what I would do after that. High school was just something I had to get through, along with college after that. Although I sorta knew I needed to take APs to look good for colleges, my school was literally number 2 in Texas. Classes were intense, even non honor classes, so I played it safe and decided not to take those AP classes. In reality, I should have just stayed at the school I was zoned to and got in the top 10 percent or atleast gonig there would have allowed me to feel safe taknig AP classes. That magnet school experience caused me to go from the confident smart girl to the kinda lost girl. This was my fault, I chose to stay at this school in hopes it would get me into a good college. It barely helped me at all.

I moved between my junior and senior year. Was going to get kicked out of this language magnet school anyway due to my grades in Algebra 2 and Physics. (LOL and yall are talking about taking Calc and I was still in Algebra 2 as a Junior lolololol). Moving to another state right before college app season hit added a whole layer of complexity and stress to the process. I was having to email my counselor, teachers and such, trying my damn best to line all my ducks up. But even then, there was so much out of my control, and I was not able to go to the school and meet with these people in person. I was needing to sit there and pray they understood what I needed from them. Well some schools didn't get everything they needed as a result of this mess. When all was said and done, I only got into UPitt cause they had other campuses they opened up to students they want to admiot but don't have room for at their main campus, and I got in at the campus I ranked as the campus I wanted to go to least.

That summer though , my mom lost her job, and even though she got one that payed an equal amount before I was supposed to go to college, she still asked that I start at a community college. So I did. I was happy I was saving money, but at the same time, the community college path tends to kinda make the college journey feel mroe stretched out and tedious than if you were to go to a 4 year to begin with, especially when your school has no classes linked to my major at the time Japanese. I had wanted to teach Japanese as a career, but finally came to my senses and decided this career path was not a good idea - I was never really able to connect with kids or get them to listen / respect me without another adult needing to step in. I also hated the idea of needing to teach the same lessons every year . . .I became lost as to what I really wanted to do, and knew I was just wasting my time at colleg, so I withdrew from my classes. I didn't think I was going back. I had done research and saw that college was not the olnly way to succeed

I went home , sat in front of my PC and tried to plan out my next move. However, it was difficult, because outside my door, my sister's new boyfriend was verbally abusing and taunting my nephew constantly, and giving him ruthless spankings that made the kid scream. I tried to stop that because I cared deeply for my nephew, however the boyfriend just got aggressive with me, told me to mind my own business, and made my own life hell, getting in my business, bossing me around over my life and what I could and couldn't do in the house. My mom didn't want to confront him or my sister, and so she just wanted me to listen to them. My mom also didn't want me getting mad at or criticizing my little sister who is autistic, and coddled by my mom, not getting the help she needs to succeed despite her handy cap, which she absolutely can succeed with the right help. She can communicate and learn , just slowly, but for a long time, people dragged their feet in pushing her. I just mention that all to paint the picture of the difficult home life I was dealing with while needing to forge a life for myself. Things got somewhat better but, still ehh

I remembered I'd always wanted to learn how to fix PCs, so I decided to go to trade school to learn how to fix PCs. I went to trade school for nine months, while working a part time job to pay for it. It was a tough time filled with hard work, but I got through it, and I'm damn proud of that. I earned two CompTIA certs: A+ and Network+. I had a contract job lined up before I graduated. However, after that contract job, I couldn't land any other job, all other companies wanted more experience or a degree . . .for a job that pays 12.50 an hour lol. So I gave in reluctantly and admitted I would need a degree to go forward since I wanted to work for a semi big company in an office. Why? My life even before this has been, insane, and, I just want to try to get back to some sort of ""normalcy"" .

I tried programming, realized I liked it. I began working on my AS in Comp Science at my local CC and I am finishing that now and am applying to 4 years to transfer, going through the application process again . So far I've had, better luck. My biggest dream is UMich as many of you know. My pre-withdrawng grades dropped my GPA some, but I am currently at a 3.46 GPA . . .hoping my essay are strong enough that UMich takes me. Two friends who helped me get through tough times go there, it'd be nice to study there with them.

This whole process taught me to have patience, and even though life can kinda throw you in to a crazy ride, hold on and ride it through, find beauty in the sites the ride takes you through, and do your best to understand why you are taking this ride and what can be gained from it. I gained patience, and a crazy strong determination to leave my house and make a life for myself with good friends and family. I never dreamed about my future before going down this path, now I feel like I'n working hard for a warm happy future, and it gives me the strength to keep going.

OKKKKK I'm done, sorrry for the masso post. Thank you so, so much for reading, hope you got someting out of that. Always wear your seat belt.

1070,Williampram23,1545966732,/r/college/comments/aa6c2r/college_isnt_for_me_dropped_out_the_beginning_of/," The majority of college gradutes (especilly MBA and not especially the science and med field) will stop learning once they get a job. They will never touch a single book again in their life because they think they've passed that stage of learning. At least in Thailand, where I'm from. I went to Australia, went to do sports management, it wasn't for me. I wanted to change to sports science, because I've studied BTEC sports science in the UK and got an overall D\*, they didn't let me because of my failing grades in something that I have no interest in and I sucked at. College is no longer about exploring options anymore. It has become a factory.

If you don't trust in your own ability to be successful without formal education or a piece of paper proving that you have education. That's a huge sign that you're weak. (Again, not med students, science students or engineers). Ok so I dropped out after the first year of management classes. I spent about 8 months working, saving money and learning through books. (One thing I hate the most is being a burden to my parents) Aleady in October I started my own business while my friends still have 3 years left of school. I'm doing really well for myself actually. Even if it fails, I still gain a lot of quality experience way before anyone around me at my age, something you'll never get sitting in class, or some bullshit college class ""practical"" assignment. That doesn't work.

If you read this, don't decide to drop out and expect to be happy and relaxed. It's requires considerable amount of energy, financial responsibility and hard work, but it pays off in the end. Just this year alone my anxiety and depression was through the roof, but it ended well for me.

Now that I've been through a management course (one before this was hospitality which I dropped out as well), I'll say that you're paying money to learn how to please people. That's all it is. A course teaching people how to please other people and taking their money. You can learn all that in 3 months through books plus personal finance and gaining actual experience. Not only that, but you will actualy have fun doing so as you get to apply what you learn stright away.......STRAIGHT AWAY.",college,"College isn't for me, dropped out the beginning of this year.

1072,Raentina,1545156387,/r/college/comments/a7dij1/professor_breached_confidentiality_of_my/,"Hi all, I would greatly appreciate if anyone could give me any advice.  I will try to be as clear and succinct as possible while explaining my situation.

&amp;nbsp;

I am in an Dual-Degree Engineering program at a large school in the midwest.  Essentially, in the DD program, you spend your first 3 years of college at a liberal arts school, and in your 3rd year, you can apply to an Engineering program at my current college.  You complete your engineering degree in two years (Bachelors) or alternatively you could be accepted into the 3 year program that includes a bachelors and a masters.

&amp;nbsp;

I was accepted into the masters degree option.  The master's degree option offers a scholarship of 50%&gt;55%&gt;60% off tuition.  The percentage the scholarship covers increases each year you attend.

&amp;nbsp;

Everything was fine and dandy until I did abysmal my first semester at the new college.  I was diagnosed with ADHD in the beginning of my second semester, and I did not receive full treatment and accommodations until the second semester was nearly half way completed.  I did better this semester, and my GPA increased nearly a full point.

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, during the first couple weeks of my classes during the second semester, I had an altercation with one of my professors.  I sent **all** of my professors an email detailing that I was in the process of receiving a diagnosis for ADHD, and that I would be receiving accommodations shortly as they were going through the process of being approved.

&amp;nbsp;

One of my professors decided it would be appropriate to explain to my entire class the next day that anyone who receives testing accommodations has an unfair advantage, and that if they need extra time, they should reassess their ability to become an engineer.

&amp;nbsp;

I was floored, but I ignored what had been said.  A class period or so later, the same professor singled me out in front of the class and breached confidentiality of my disability.  I immediately left the class, and reported what I had experienced to disability services.  They recommended I should speak to a Dean within the engineering school.  I spoke with the dean, and per his request, I wrote a report of the events that unfolded in the class.

&amp;nbsp;

In the end, the Dean and I spoke, and both agreed that it would be best for me to drop this class.

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, this class was a prereq for all of the classes I needed to take in the next semester.  I was told my path to graduation would be a little bumpy due to this, but in the end, things should be okay.  

&amp;nbsp;

I went on to substantially increase my grades this semester (my final grades aren't out yet, but I am expected to be on dean's list).  I don't know what came of the situation with the professor, but I have been told by multiple sources that the professor has repeatedly made comments about people with disabilities in front of the class.  He has clearly not learned his lesson, and as far as I know was not punished.  This is very discouraging because this man set me back an entire year due to his actions.

---

Today I received an email that my college will not be providing any scholarship for the final year I need to complete my degree.  I had dropped out of the masters program option because it did not feel feasible for me to stay yet another year, since I was already set back a year due to the situation with my professor.

&amp;nbsp;

I was told I need to pay the entirety of tuition either with loans or to essentially just *figure it out*.  (Cue me sobbing uncontrollably on my bathroom floor)

&amp;nbsp;

I am completely taking aback for what I can do here.  I cannot afford to take out nearly 60K in loans to finish one more year of school.  I am starting to look into scholarships I can apply to now.  I emailed another Dean in the engineering school and explained all of the events that lead to this moment.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm just beside myself right now.  I have worked so incredibly hard to fix all that my ADHD destroyed in my life.  This semester was such a turning of events for me, and I am so incredibly proud of what I have done to have control on my life.

I thought maybe I should go into community college right after dropping out so I did, for two semesters, in which I left with a 0.0 gpa (no, thats not a typo).  I dropped of course and then I eventually found a great job to get me started out in life. A restaurant job. I started out at the bottom working part time as a host, and over several years worked my way into part time management and bartending.  I was fed up with it though at that point. I didn't want to spend my 20s working in a restaurant and then getting drunk at the bar next door. I wanted to do something and have a more predictable career (also wanted to get as far away from an ex gf but thats a different story for another time).  

I moved back in with my parents and started attending community college again. I chose Computer Information Technology w/ concentration on programming. It's not a traditional CS, It's more like a bootcamp, but with accreditation and my credits will transfer to most in state universities. 

My first semester was... average.  I passed and that was just a big enough milestone as it is.  

My next semester was my first successful semester. I didn't get below a B.  From then I knew I could do this, and started taking school very seriously

The following semesters till now I've taken rigorous schedules in order to repair my GPA.  

As of now, my GPA stands at a 2.97, and if my last class I'm waiting on ends up being an A (Which it should be) I'll break the 3.00 threshold, the highest GPA I've ever held in school ever.

But even better news, I just received my first internship offer! I'll be interning at a company I've always dreamed of working at.  I'll be doing software development. The company is no google or facebook, but you've heard of them.  

It's been a journey and a half.

My first year here my GPA tanked, had a mental breakdown, dropped all my classes. Took summer classes - got sick and failed the one desperately I needed. Started fall out fresh, determined to succeed. Decided to go to CAPS early this time to get some help but it didn't help; I quickly was overwhelmed, had yet another breakdown and dropped half my schedule. I need to figure out a new major because with all this failure the path I wanted to take has been made impossible, yet I have absolutely zero interest in anything so that doesn't help anyone help me and I'm terrified to speak to my academic advisor. 

I guess I like this place because it's far but not too far from home. My family always kept me on a short leash, basically holding me by the collar, I wasn't allowed much freedom or independence. Even when I was going to community college and living home that's how things were. I couldn't leave the house alone, seriously, my father would not allow me to take myself to class, someone had to pick me up and drop me off and he knew my schedule so no sticking around after class to study or participate in clubs or anything. It's a breath of fresh air to be able to just go for a goddamn walk if I want even though my dad still calls and wants to know where I am/what I'm doing etc. 

I do hate that I'm still completely and utterly alone but that's my own fault. It's my fault I'm alone, it's my fault I'm failing, and it's my fault that I'm in a massive amount of debt but at least I'm not stuck at home feeling like a slave. I love being here for my independence but I also reeeaalllyy hate it because of the failure and isolation and guilt and all of the things  I've missed out on and because I'm not graduating this spring like I was supposed to.

I've  been reading posts of people asking about getting round-ups and I've  seen a lot of mixed answers. I took my final exam last week, and had  about a 90 going into it. I got a 92ish on the other two unit exams and  quiz grades in the mid-80s that were quizzes on different novels. This  is a history course btw.

&amp;#x200B;

Thing  is, I had some stuff happen with my family (parents divorcing, brother  probably flunking out of college, parents upset with me for wanting to  leave my school, realizing i didnt get to really live a normal life just  now) that started fucking with my mind during and after thanksgiving  break, making it harder for me to focus. I'm not trying to use this as a  lame excuse, but it really did get me upset out of nowhere sometimes  and i truly believe it affected my schoolwork.

&amp;#x200B;

In  this class, I ended up doing pretty badly on the final (worse than my  other unit exam grades) and I really do blame this. It was super hard to  actually be able to study and focus, but i just told myself id be fine.  My grade dropped from an A- to a B overall, missing a B+ (87.51) by  about .2%.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm  not going to lie, I never went to my professors office hours (literally  had class during all her office hours), so I really dont want her to  get a vibe that im just trying to make her feel bad and that i dont care  about the class. However, I've done all the assignments that were  assigned (which dont count toward our grade but she expects us to do  them), took the only extra credit opportunity of the semester, and have  emailed her a few times about questions about quizzes/tests. Infact, I  just emailed her recently about the latest test, but didnt realize that I  didnt get a B+ at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore,  what would be my best approach to ask how her rounding policy works?  Due to my extenuating circumstances, I feel like my grade didnt show  what Im really capable of, and my grade drop was basically out of my  control. Im worried about sounding like a suckup or a bs'er, but I  really feel like this is something that I deserve due to these  circumstances.

1078,Forevershadow1,1544592842,/r/college/comments/a5f8kg/the_pressure_of_college_why_is_it_worth_it/,"I am 25 years old, and I had a good run the past year through community college. I proved to myself and family that I could get straight A's in subjects like math. I never knew what ""I wanted to do"", and in fact I still don't know. 

I struggled with the whole ""going no where"" thing, ever since I was out of high school. I did not do a single scrap of work, ever. In my early 20s, my only interest in college was science. So I started to major in Chem.

After several developmental math courses up to precalc, I did very well. This fall semester, I took 3 courses: general chem 2, physics 1 and math. As time went on, I started to fall behind. I noticed that I would do whatever it took to forget all of the work ahead of me, and how impractical life and the idea of careerism is. I abuse all types of ways to relax and forget that I exist. I drink often, drugs, etc. just to try and forget the fact that I need to do all kinds of monotonous studying  for the next 4 years to *maybe* get some career and or prove to others that maybe I'm not a loser. I have no sort of solace, and I learned that I am overall not mentally healthy being a college student on top of not being mentally healthy in the first place. 

These discoveries happened this particular semester, although when I was 19 I dropped out of community college with the same story. I thought maybe this past year of short success was my savior. 

I hate college, I hate the customs and I just hate the general idea of it. I hate the feeling of intense guilt, that my parents support me and pay my tuition, while I just sit and read books at 25. I always get the urge to just drop out, run away and start my own life somewhere else. What ever happened to just opening up your own mom and pop shop, just living a simple life?

I've heard it all ""well it's worth it in the long run"", ""do you want to scrub floors for the rest of your life?""  Also things like, ""well, that's life.""  Here is my answer to all of this: I do not care anymore. I would rather be homeless, I would rather work a shit job, I would rather lay in bed all day until I die. It has taken me almost a decade of brainstorming to tell you all this. I am so done with college and it's gimmicks and it's expensive necessities. They say ""maybe college isn't for you"". Honestly, I don't know what is or isn't for me anymore. 

But why do we pressure people so hard? Why does society perpetuate the idea that college is for the winners, the ones who succeed? Why does it seem  that college is the only way to have an interesting career? I know this may all be debunked by someone- but let's be honest: media, parents, teachers, etc. all perpetuate this. 

So, when you drop out of college and pursue some certification program, a trade of some sort, or anything else really: why do we subconsciously consider that to be a downgrade? Would your parents at a family gathering be happier to tell everyone that you attained a degree, or that you're in a certification program? There's this degradation behind all of it, but at this point, fuck it.  

I am still enrolled and have a shit load of work to do this week. Me getting through this semester is looking extremely slim. I just wanted to express my thoughts and opinions on here. I'm sure a lot of people here are meant for college. For people like me, it's complicated. I like the idea of learning and becoming more intelligent. I just hate everything else about it.

So, I attend a good university in the UK. Top 1% in the world. I found my last year's in high school easy enough and managed to get into this good uni. 

Now, I have never had a good work ethic and am a serial procrastinator; this along with the fact that I have become a mild alcoholic, has meant that, on an purely academic level, my first semester has been incredibly poor. 

I started with 6 modules, I now do 5 (dropped one), am certainly going to fail one, will probably pass 1 and the other 3 are on dodgy ground. I have attended around 20% of lectures. Around 35% (give or take) of my seminars/tutorials and have got my first exam on Tuesday, which I have not opened a book for. I have consistently put off essay after essay and have even gone to less than digniful lengths to get extensions. I hand my essays in two weeks late (-4 grades) just before the last deadline for acceptance is. For some essays, I just straight up didn't hand them in. 

I wasted my student loan, nearly £2000 all in all, on expensive food, clothes and lots of alcohol, all within the space of less than a month.

I understand my problem is procrastination, but I just can stop being lazy. I am undisciplined.

I guess this is more venting than anything, but has anyone else been in this situation? Do you guys think I can salvage college in Semester Two? What steps should I take over my 3 week Christmas holiday? 

Thanks.

I would say I have it relatively easy. I have a full ride to my university, minimal loans taken out. Parents cover the rest of my needs such as food and housing, but I just hate it. 

My first semester of uni was a disaster. I slacked off hard and spent a lot of time making friends, and no time in class. Through highschool I didn’t have many friends, and moving into college I gained a bunch. The attention got the best of me and I ended my first semester with a 2.1. Problem was my scholarship requires a 3.0 by the end of the summer. Parents were insanely mad since they don’t have the money to cover my in state schooling. Which I totally understand. I too was disappointed in myself. 

Come second semester, I grade replaced some of my failing courses from the first semester and was able to finish off my 2nd semester with a 2.9. A couple of summer courses later I was at a 3.1. 

I had done it. Now for the easy part, maintaining my gpa. Probably way easier to maintain it than to drag it up a mountain. 

This semester I had a change of heart with my major, and dropped out of 2 of the courses, got a major change, and I’m looking forward to next semester since it seems more up my alley. Problem is that this semester I slacked off a lot. Not to the point where my gpa will drop, but more so to the point where it will be hugging a 2.95 come the end of this semester. And I am stressed having to deal with my parents.

Currently living with my close friends just off of campus. Parents are going to pull me out if my cumulative gpa drops below a 3.0. What they fail to realize is that this will only further demotivate me. I really don’t want to have to commute from home, over 30 minutes away. Every day. And miss out on every social thing that occurs. 

Currently I think I am struggling with depression/lack of motivation since even though I’m surrounded with opportunities and friends, I just feel so alone with my thoughts. I am also very unhappy with going to university, despite the fact that my second semester seems to be more in line with something I would enjoy, I just don’t like the entire environment of school. I just feel like a robot and in my eyes there is so much more to life than sitting around studying for hours and attending classes for years.

My question is; is their any way I can minimize this semester when applying to another college? I entered it with a 3.6 but have no idea what Ill have after, do you think this one semester totally sunk me?

TL;DR: Had a 3.6 and was done my AA. Made the foolish decision to pursue an AS before moving onto a better college.

1094,Guts1019,1542088825,/r/college/comments/9wmfh3/looking_to_go_back_to_community_college_after/,"So I am 22 years old and I used to attend community college. I was doing about 2 classes per semester while working a small 30ish hours a week and I would pass one then fail one. After a few semesters of my shenanigans I got put on academic probation, and the last semester I took(fall 2017) I had to drop my classes to avoid being put on suspension. Afterwords I decided that college wasn't for me and haven't gone back.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm in a situation where I work 60 hours a week doing manual labor. I absolutely hate it. I have come to realize doing school would of been a hell lot easier. The reason I did so shitty in community college if you already haven't guessed it was poor work ethic on my part. I was more concerned with smoking pot with my friends and video games than I was studying. After the first few months of the semester I also picked up bad habbits of skipping classes. And looking back at it I'm just so mad at myself for being that stupid. When I was in class, I was taking notes, participating in discussion, ect. and was doing everything right in the classroom. But when I left the classroom I put my head up my ass by not doing assignments, being a regular skipper of reading my textbooks that I spent money on, and overall just not being on top of things. 

&amp;#x200B;

After dropping my last classes, I one upped my stupidity by getting a DUI. However it has been a little bit of a blessing in disguise. By being on probation I was forced to quit smoking weed and after awhile of being sober I realized how much it was holding me back. I know I'm still going to have to fix my work ethic, but I think getting off pot is a decent start. I have contacted the community college I went too, since I dropped my last classes I am OK to return and take classes again. My community college also has grade replacement so if I retake classes I failed in the past and pass them, the passing grade will replace the fail. So I know if I do go back I'll be in great position to fix my academic career. I'm planning on working this job I hate for the time being until I pay off my medical debt and have some money saved for my outlandish insurance cost for when I get my license back.

1096,frenchclassthrowaway,1541801560,/r/college/comments/9voufl/consistently_late_no_active_syllabus_lack_of/,"I've been taking this French class since August. I could have dropped but didn't (totally regret it) largely because I had an expectation that things would get on track and we would follow a standard syllabus despite the professor being an adjunct.


As it turns out, after day one two people dropped. We had switched bookstores a few weeks before classes started and had been notified of the change long enough to get our books in order. We learn that the online portion for our books requires more than what the new bookstore is selling (due to the adjunct apparently not checking- blamed it on the prior prof) and so we will need to purchase an extra component that costs anywhere from $25 to $150. 


There was talk of getting a refund for people who paid more than they had to (since the new site conveniently left out a rental option and only had the option to buy new) but I genuinely can't tell you how I would go about accessing that and getting my money back. The professor briefly mentioned it, but again since there's near-zero paper trail with this person and people can't be expected to remember every little detail I feel like asking them will only set them off and get them mad at me.


September turns into October and they consistently shows up late, to a point where a class going for 1 and a quarter hours only runs for an hour. In practice, you'd have a contingent of commuter students come in ten minutes early and not get to see the professor for twenty five minutes. The professor has been getting better, but at one point they came in for every class that wasn't their evaluation **at least** 5-10 minutes late.

Looking at the syllabus, we should have at that point in September/October been on to Chapter 4, yet we're still getting through Chapter 1. It's only now in November we're finishing up Chapter 2. We sometimes use the online book but just barely. A few weeks ago we had a massive glut of assignments (something like 10-20 assignments per day that were just cycling over each other since they called on the same chapter) and then nothing since then. 


I've mentioned this previously, but we have no concrete syllabus to draw on. It's to a point where I'm having to message classmates the night before class to figure out what if anything is due or if we have any exams. We haven't had anything that resembles a midterm. The syllabus we do have is from the old professor (who we never met) and we haven't been following it whatsoever from what I can see. 


There's a general lack of communication. At one point this professor left a note for us on the room without any email or semblance that they were going to be out that day. The class is majority commuter, I think I might be the only person in that class who lives on campus. A few times this professor has put notifications on Canvas but the last one is from a solid month ago. 


There's a sense of apathy within the language department that I've noticed just through brief interactions. If another school nearby us (and there are a few high profile colleges) offer a language ""Why should we? The majority of our students commute in."" If a class doesn't have at least 4 students (even the more advanced classes like 201 which I could have gotten placed in due to prior French experience) it isn't allowed to convene. 


In a similar vein, we have no tutoring program for this class. I know a fellow student who has been learning French for 6 years who has tried to get a program set up, but I haven't heard anything about the program existing outside of an email they sent me in late October.

I am strongly considering (for the thousandth time) transferring from my Florida university (first semester at USF for bachelor's, got my AA from PHSC.) to a school in New York, or D.C, maybe Chicago? My heart is mainly set on New York, as it is where I am from. Got my AA from PHSC, took a lot of science courses, and at one point I was taking 18 credits (human anatomy/physiology 2 with lab, bio 1 with lab, public speaking, english 2, intermediate algebra) because I have no life. Anyways, I am typically an A/B student, though that changed over the summer when I took FOUR classes (2 math, 2 electives. A/B in elective, C in both math). 

 I thought transferring to USF would be lifechanging and be a huge step up from PHSC, but it is the same thing on a larger scale. I initially wanted to major in Criminology, but a lot of people (including an advisor) steered me away from that and into Political Science.........signed up for four classes and now I have dropped to just one because a) I hate the major/classes, b) not a fan of the school, c) I really feel like Florida just is not for me, and I have always wanted to move back to New York. 

Right now my GPA is at a whopping 3.15, which is super low for me. I love school and usually have a 3.8 AT LEAST. I am looking into majoring in criminology or sociology (some schools don't have an undergrad crim program) and I submitted my FAFSA to five schools beside USF 

1. NYU 
2. CUNY- Brooklyn
3. Georgetown 
4. St. Johns
5. University of Illinois at Chicago

I would more than likely be taking out (more) student loans, and I would get a job. I am not sure if I would live on or off campus.  Careerwise, I would like to pursue criminal psychology and eventually work for the behavioral science unit within the FBI as a profiler. I guess I am not sure what my next step would be, as I really dont know what my chances are at getting accepted into any of those schools (esp NYU or Georgetown...looooool) are. I would like to start Summer or Fall of 2019.

1100,MononymousAnonymous,1541423011,/r/college/comments/9udbhf/trying_to_better_a_bad_situation/,"Hey, everyone! I would love to receive advice on this as it's been eating me up anyway, but lately it has been on my mind. I haven't even slept all night. So background on me, I graduated high school in 2012. I knew I wanted to go to college afterward, but because my parents were spending big on my sister at a privately owned college, I had no problems whatsoever going small at a community college. I would have never expected the outcome. I know college was a whole other monster, but I struggled most of my way through even with attempting. My first semester at college, I flunked 3/5 of my classes. Although I did not brush off my classes, there was so much drama involving my life that I internalized it and it would take residence in my mind, space that should have been fully dedicated to strictly academics. At this time, I was living a poor lifestyle. Parents were struggling financially, so we ate what we could afford. I had trouble keeping up multiple deadlines. It was like the amount of dedication to each class was so much for me that I couldn't keep up with deadlines even with a planner. I would start projects; take a reasonable rest, complete said projects and then have near panic attacks because I had not started the other projects, ones that might have been due earlier. It was a mess. During this time also, I had people that I met through college that I found fairly quickly were there to make my life hell. They were juvenile, petty, and all around started unnecessary high school-esque drama. Needless to say, grades dropped and academic probation started and financial aid rescinded. During that break in semesters, I gained a job and paid for classes out of pocket. Since then, grades have found ups and downs. Starting the next semester, I realized I could take a lower amount of credits. Doing that helped greatly! Grades were better. The downside comes in because some classes I needed to withdraw before failing or others I tried to see it through and ended up failing. My GPA is not stellar, but it is fixable with proper diligence. Work started taking precedence because I need to help family finances as my other siblings were not working. Then work kept taking precedence, pushing my progress further... Now my youngest sibling at this point will graduate before me. The year 2015 was the last time I attended classes and I'm trying to get back. The only issue? Math. Math keeps holding back my success. The SAME class. The course uses the infamous MyMathLab. Yeah... The first time I took it, like all MyMathLab courses, it counts you wrong when you're right. I took to writing my homework instead after explaining to the prof. Still failed course. Huh. Second semester, tried again. Same result. I even emailed the professor for an explanation. Didn't help. I'm trying for this class again, guys. I need this. I've been given the whole runaround about seeing advisor A/B/C then back to C then being told I should have went to Q. 

My plan is to just transfer myself into another community college for that math credit as a new student as I'm afraid this past will hinder my progress for college altogether. I want to make it. I want to do what I'd love to pursue in life. I don't want to feel trapped, but that's all I've been feeling. Please help. What's your best advice for me, Reddit?

Starting the semester, I had a 3.8 GPA (unweighted), but now it has dropped to a 3.5. This is because I chose Honors Precalculus this year.
   
     I had Regulars Algebra 2 last year so the transition was difficult and I found myself behind everyone in the curriculum. Trig. was torture for me, but we have moved on to easier concepts like a review of Compound-Interest and Exponential Equations. The problem is that now I have a 73% (C) in the class. 

     I’m stressing out about how I can explain this to colleges when I apply. My friends are all bragging about having 4.0+ GPAs and they literally have no idea how to respond to mine dropping. Will competitive schools still look at me? My teacher doesn’t care and says that as long as we learn, he doesn’t care if we get a fail. 

     I tried to leave the class into Regulars Precalculus, but my counselor said it was too late to switch (as it was almost halfway through the semester). My other grades are all good: 4 A’s and 1 B (AP Chemistry is challenging, but fun). Is there a way that I can not have my transcripts ruined? Any advice at all?

1.

2. My previous college, on top of mental illness at the time, wasn't a good fit for me. Is there any chance another college (preferably out of state) would actually accept me? This has been a pretty big source of stress for me since I dropped out 

3. Is just ""starting over"" at college something that's possible to do? I'd rather just have a clean slate since I only went very briefly and I've been working on sorting out my life since then, but I feel like that's not something that can be done.

So I graduated college this year with a bachelors of science in finance and a minor in information systems. The jobs I worked after graduating have been a multi level marketing sales job where I did well but burned out cause sometimes I made great money and there were times I made zero money. Then did a temp job at KPMG as a tax processor for a month and now I'm at best buy working in inventory. The biggest reason I regret it is because of my student loan debt I owe about 35 thousand and that was with a scholarship for swimming (that payed 25 percent) and financial aid cause my family is poor. So I was brainwashed in high school by guidance counselors and advisers saying we should go to college. So I did and graduated with a 3.4 gpa. What pisses me off so much is that the high school counselors hype it up so much when you aren't guaranteed shit afterwards just a mountain of debt. I mean I would have been better off if I just started working at an amazon warehouse for 15 an hour (I live in jersey). At least I would of had no debt.

I should start this off by saying that I am a nontraditional student. I started working at 13 (cleaning houses with my landlord and getting paid under the table if you're curious), dropped out at 16 when both parents were too sick/lazy to work and we were facing eviction for the third time, and began courses at the local community college around the same time because I was terrified of ending up like my parents- poor, uneducated, and unfulfilled. I have paid every single penny out of pocket so I have no student loan debt, work full time to keep all of my bills paid, and bring home about $85k/year after taxes (new job- been an accountant without an accounting degree for about 2 months now). I'm 22f and have 84 credits out of the 128 I need to graduate.

Recently, I deferred for a semester to ""focus on work and my relationship""- but really, I just don't feel motivated to do school anymore. I've already switched majors once. I'm tired of having to do ""group projects"" FOR adult children with no sense of responsibility, who completely disgust me. The subject (accounting) no longer really interests me.

My brother recently dropped out of college, really no reason why, a week before class was gonna start he came to my parents and I and said he doesn’t want to go anymore. He’d rather be a claims adjuster (this was all very random and just came out of nowhere). My parents, myself and a few others tried to understand why but I guess the idea of college to him is a scam and doesn’t like it. 

We are coming up on November and he still has made zero progress to try something else. Whether it be a trade school or what have you. He hasn’t done anything in the meantime to find something else. 

We’re 22 and he’s in this idea that his career will fall outta the sky in front of him. My dads a barber and owns his own business and we even tried to talk to him about going to barber school and no. 

He wants to sit back, make money and not really “work”. 

I’ve heard the cliche of “college isn’t for everyone” and that’s fine but you have to find something else right?

Is college really a scam? He’s been listening to countless number of people who sort of feeds this notion into his head as well.

My first year I stayed on campus and came in with the wrong mindset. I used to go to a top three school in my state for 8th-10th grade until my grades were so bad I was asked to leave. After that I went to my local high school for 10th-graduation where the curriculum was very behind and catered more to trying to keep students in class being that it was in a bad neighborhood with a high dropout rate and as you could guess high crime rate. I breezed by and nearly had straight A's my time there except for a couple high B's, but the classes were just so dumbed down compared to what I was used to. I graduated with I'd say a higher end 3.0 GPA around 3.7 is my guess, but it didn't mean much considering where all the grade inflation came from. I entered college with the mindset I could just breeze through it as well so my first semester of college was spent partying and going out 90% of the time with guys who aren't even enrolled any more as you could guess. You could say I fell into the wrong crowd where I was influenced to go out every night instead of completing my math homework due by 10 PM. It didn't help that I had a weak mind who wasn't good at making decisions for himself and an addictive personality that thought I needed to get drunk in order to socialize. So I basically failed three classes in total my first year of college and ended up with a 1.7 GPA to show for it causing my state scholarship to be suspended with a two year probation period for it to be reinstated that I just barely missed so my scholarship was permanently cancelled this past May. It hurts my heart having to type that part out still knowing I had my tuition fully paid for compared to now where I have a grant, but I still end up paying money out of pocket to cover the remaining tuition which is a burden compared to going to college completely free. My second year was spent trying to bring my GPA up to regain my scholarship all the way until now. I can't believe I typed all of that out, but I guess it won't matter considering I typed my question in the title. 

TLDR: So I'm in my fourth year now with a 2.5 GPA trying to bring it up to a 3.0 still and just had to drop one of my core classes for my degree because I did bad on the tests so far and my lazyass always comes to class late so I've ended up missing three quizzes which count for 15% of my grade so it's a permanent -10 to my overall no matter what. I didn't take school serious my freshman year and I feel like after three years I still haven't learned my lesson so I feel really down right now and was wondering if anybody improved after doing horribly their first one or two years of college. Dropping that class also dropped me down to only three classes this semester so this is my first time being a part-time student and I feel bummed knowing I'm barely taking any classes, but still ended up almost failing my core class if it wasn't for me dropping it.

I’m a nontraditional undergrad student- I do distance education with some courses on campus. I’m 22 now, been in college part time since I was 16 after I dropped out to start working full time. I’ve got about $20k into my degree, no student loans, and 80 credits (need 128 to graduate). I’m a Business major with a concentration in Finance, and I haven’t really struggled with the difficulty of my courses or anything.


However, I am horribly depressed and it’s making it very difficult for me to do anything related to school anymore. Every penny to pay for school comes out of my own pocket, so I am super scared of wasting a bunch of money and having to take a course twice, but even that isn’t enough to make me keep up with studies. I’m starting to wonder if maybe college just isn’t for me. I’m definitely no idiot... it’s just getting harder and harder to push ahead, and I’ve been doing this for so long now that it feels like it’s never going to end. I get the sense, more and more, that I’m spinning my wheels and wasting my money. Like is there any point if I’m already making $80k+ at my current job...?


Anyone else going through this? What do you do to keep yourself moving? Should I just save myself the money and drop out? Pls help friends 😢

I transferred to uni from community college last year. But uni is turning out to be more difficult than community college. 

First off, I’m a communication major and my major classes, I’m doing amazingly in. All A’s. Biology is online and a lot of it is literally all online (answers and everything). A for that class. My Spanish class grade is abysmal. Just found I made a 46/100 on our first test. Which dropped my overall grade to a 60, which as most know, is failing. 

My bio lab is trying to creep up to a C. So I hope that that class will be a passing grade. But now I’m slightly freaking out that I will fail this Spanish class. 

It kinda aggravated me because the classes that will do nothing for me but are simply academic requirements are the most demanding. While the ones for my major aren’t nearly as bad. 

On top of all of this, I really freaking hate my job. I work in a brass factory part time as an assembler and my boss is bipolar as hell. Half the time, he’s joking around with me and being funny. The next he has a major attitude with me and gets very smart with me. Which has gotten to the point where I’m afraid to even come up to him and ask questions because idk what kind of response I’ll get. 

My schedule is very busy. Work at 7am, leave at noon, get to class at 1, stay until 4:45 on Monday and Wednesday, Tuesday and Thursday are my work days where I work all morning and afternoon from 7 or 8am until 3. Friday’s, I have Spanish from 1 to 2 and that’s it. But I have to take into consideration that homework plays a large role as well. What sucks is a lot of times when I get home, I’m so exhausted (physically and mentally) that i don’t feel like even doing homework. Which I basically force myself to push through it anyway. Despite me being 100% drained. I’ve forgotten to do assignments here and there and almost forgot to write an essay worth 50 points of my grade yesterday. Had I not skipped Spanish class and done it in the library, my grade for that class would’ve dipped badly. 

Being that I’ve been in school collectively for six years, I’m tired. I just wanna move on and start my career. Lots of people tell me don’t rush it. But it’s hard when you’re so mentally fatigued from being in school for so long and you probably have about two years or so to go seems like hell. Especially if I have to take BS classes that cause me to have unneeded stress.

Way back in 2013 I dropped out fo high school. This was due to a combination of things, for one, I was homeless at the time, and sleeping on friends couches, but also I have two learning disabilities. The combo of audio processing disorder, and dysgraphia. Meaning that my brain is shit at listening to things, and I have a hard time transferring my thoughts to paper. Thee public school system refused to do much for me, and most accommodations I did get where ignored by instructors. 

in 2015, I got my GED, and started at the community college planning to get a history degree. At this time, I had my own place and was working \~30ish hours a week. After a year I switched to a Computer Science degree. Failed Pre-calc the first time around, and then took it again the next semester and passed with an A. 

This year, I started at a university. I'm a little behind schedule, but no biggie. Most of my classes are going well. But I'm still shit at Math. I can't figure out why. I take as many notes as I can on my laptop, and generally the concepts I have fairly down pat, but there's so much that I just can't for the life of me figure out. I'm failing horribly at this course. Worse, I'm broke, but not ""dorm life so broke haha"". Like I literally am starving myself because I can't afford food, and my power is getting cut off next week if I can't find money to pay it. Worse, in march of this year, I went through some shit and figured out that, contrary to popular belief and despite having a penis, a woman. So that's also seriously eating away at my mental health. I've cancelled my last three therapy appointments because I can't afford them, and my last batch of hormones was $202. I have no support system whatsoever, I work a shit ton, I have a shit ton of homework, I'm trans, but am so cripplingly anxious that despite actively growing tits I can't present female and actually try to pass as cis, which makes me worry that I'm not actually trans, which stresses me out more, and scares the shit out of me.

I don’t even know if it’s possible transfer credits that way, when I try to look it up all I see is articles on transferring normally(CC to Uni) 

I want to transfer because the work is really hard and stressful even though I’m only taking introductory classes at the moment. I don’t know if I can handle it for 4 years. It feels like it’s gonna take everything I have to just to get through the semester. Also I don’t feel invested as I don’t know what I want to study and I have no interests.

Some Background (sorry if it’s too long): After high school I went to a college that specializes in Criminal Justice, I wasn’t particularly interested in that field but I just went because I didn’t know what to do otherwise/it was the best school I got into. I only went one day, then dropped out(don’t even know if that counts as dropping) mostly because I didn’t want to put in effort for a degree I didn’t care for and I knew the quality of my work wouldn’t have been great either. 

After that I tried to apply to community college and try to become a paramedic. Got accepted but then I found out that I couldn’t apply for classes because I still had debt from my last school(schools here in nyc are cheap and the financial aid covers all of the tuition but since I dropped out I had to pay some of the aid back.) I also talked myself out of being a paramedic because the my anxiety is so bad that I wouldn’t trust myself to handle injured/sick people.

So I ended not going to college at all in that time and did nothing for 3 years. Staying at home mostly. My mom was reluctantly supportive, she didn’t want to push me to do something I didn’t want to. I was(still am) dealing with all sorts of health issues, mostly mental. I couldn’t take not doing anything anymore, seeing all my high school friends doing meaningful things with their lives while I did nothing was killing me.

Now I’m in college again, still without clue of what to do. The work is really hard, tedious and time consuming. The commute to my college is an hour and a half, and I have an 8am class Tus/Thurs because they didn’t let us pick out classes and times just for this semester. Lab class for physics is a disaster as my instructor is crap and I’m just a dead weight lab partner. Took my first exam today for physics lecture and felt like I was gonna vomit in class because my anxiety was so bad.

I was a nursing major going for a bachelors that a university does a partnership with my school to offer as my school mostly offers associates. After deciding the degree wasnt for me I switched to business administration. Reason being the competition made getting into the program unreasonable at best. Ive always been a C student. B if im lucky. The program in the last 5 years only accepted people with a 3.8 gpa and above. If you had to retake a class your chances of getting in where slim to non.
 
So before it was too late I switched to a business administration major. I had been toying with the idea of starting a small business while in school to make some extra cash. If im changing my major I midaswell go into something that fits. 

So here I am taking a computer litteracy class, intro to business class, a supervision online class, and principals of accounting. 

The computer litteracy class is so boring I stopped paying attention. I do the chapter work and tests to maintain a passing grade, dont do any of the labs. They are too confusing and I hate them with a passion. The supervision class is online and I didnt even buy the book until almost the halfway point in the semester nor have I looked in it for anything other than the one assignment that was due. 

The intro to business class is by far my favorite. I wouldnt miss a day even if I got shot in the foot. I do all the work. 

The accounting class started easy. Accounting is basically some simple principals and formulas that work for everything. The hard part is that you have to learn to apply them to everything so they work. It gets quickly confusing to the point you just have no clue what you are doing. On top of that mt teacher litterally has 16 assignments for this chapter alone. Each one probably takes anywhere from an hour to complete, to 9 hours. 9 HOURS ON ONE ASSIGNMENT WORTH 370 POINTS ONCE A WEEK OR 2 OUT OF 15 OTHER ASSIGNMENTS

So Ive stopped paying attention. I got the basics, how to make sure everything is balanced, thats about it. Stopped paying attention after that. 

So my point is, my family would kill me if I dropped out, I would kill me if I didnt. My only logical answer as to what I can do is stop going through the degree plan and just take the classes I think would help me the most and just never take the rest. That way Im still getting the education that I care for, without the nonsense of the rest. 

Problem is that I wont get the degree and that is about equal to just dropping out. 

Id rather go to school less and have less pointless work so I can focus on building this small businees. I just cant get around how much I feel like im wasting my time. 

I have 15 assingments due at midnight tomorrow or I will surely not be able to dig myself out of the hole. Im toying with just dropping the class and focusing on the other 3. This month is advisor month and I want to explain my ""fuck your degree I want this class, that class, and that one or im dropping out"" shpeal. 

Part of me feels like its the only answer, part of me is scared. I feel like I would be better off forgoing the degree, taking the classes I want that I feel would help me best, and getting a practice run at running a business in person. 

I feel having some classes and actually having expirience would help me rather than stumbling my way through a degree and taking the risk I might not make it though at all. 

At this point im so depressed and unwilling to hear anyones bullshit anyway that I just want to become what I want to become the way I see it. Im just not built to sit infront of a computer and try to understand new concepts when I can just go out and build it myself and gain my own understanding. 

My parents would kill me though. I think they really would. They wouldnt let me live here to save money if I dropped out. They say they support me but only when it comes to doing what they want to see me doing. 

I almost feel like I just need to get the ball rolling. Being able to say ""I ran this business"" has to be better than ""I went to school to be taught to run your business""

If anyone has any pointers please let me know, thanks

1127,quadrobomber,1538439989,/r/college/comments/9klyin/21m_left_school_after_rough_junior_year_what_now/,"So I was studying Geography at a relatively large out-of-state school. At the time it was the second half of my junior year. I had switched to the major midway through my sophomore year after starting in Business classes. I thought it was interesting enough, but I was starting to struggle with some personal problems which eventually led to me having to withdraw from the school. I wasn't forced to withdraw, as I had a 2.5 GPA by the time I left, but my GPA had dropped drastically from before junior year. I knew that if I was staying at that school, it only would've gotten worse. Moving back home has been tough but I've been working while taking a semester off to go back at a local school in the spring. The problem I'm having is that the nearest school that has a Geography program is much more expensive and a much further commute than my other options. Another school that's closer to me is a satellite school of a well-known university and fits with my budget, but their programs are limited and I'm worried about the reputation of the school. I'm not too sure about going back into business but their communications program looks good. Money isn't really a concern for me. I have grants that pay up to 20k a year for schooling. I'd really like to not have to take out a loan for a BA in geography, though. So I have a few questions with all of this in mind.

1.) What's the likelihood of my gen-eds transferring? Both schools I'm looking at are in a different state than my first school. It's gonna suck if I'm gonna have be living at home while in school until I'm 25. 

2.) What might be some other majors that I should know about? I've never really had a strong interest for any major I've taken so I honestly just want to get a degree in something broad and start looking for work. I can't change my major again though, as I've already done it twice and I'll most likely reach the time limit on my grant if I do.

3.) What can I do with a communications degree? I may still be interested in going back to business school but I originally dropped the major because of problems in my accounting and database management classes.

4.) Is a geography degree worth it in my case? I'm interested in it but I feel it limits my job prospects.

I feel like I should know by now, but nothings stuck with me. I was always interested in math and science when I was younger. I went to a STEM Academy in high school because I was interested in engineering, but I dropped out after my first year. I didn’t really feel like I belonged and the social aspect was heavily detrimental to my studies. Then I pulled an interest in Physics, but ended up dropping AP Physics because the difficulty outweighed my interest to learn more about it.

I’ve been exploring Architecture but have never really designed or created anything, so I lack any type of portfolio that’s required for applying. I’m also somewhat interested in Psychology and Philosophy, but don’t see potential future jobs in those. They’re also mere interests of mine and I’m not sure I’d actually enjoy learning more in depth about the subjects.

I’m fairly defiant on going to a trade school, so that’s not really an option. I have nothing against trades. I understand we need them, but I’ve worked jobs like that and they just don’t do it for me.

1130,Alex1398,1538092285,/r/college/comments/9ji0qj/looking_for_advice_on_how_to_move_forward_long/,"Hi all, so this is going to be a pretty lengthy post because I've been very stressed out for the past year trying to figure out what I want to major in and what I want to do in life in general.

I'm currently a sophomore at a pretty good school, but I want to first give you some deep background on myself to explain where I'm coming from when I say that I feel completely lost.

Back when I was a little kid in elementary school (this will sound ridiculous) I was an extremely good student despite having a lot of health problems because of my asthma. I'd been hospitalized multiple times each year, but I still did extremely well in school.

This then carried over to middle school where I was especially strong in math and science, at least in the beginning of middle school. I switched schools before 7th grade and began getting bullied for my weight. I'd been teased in the past, but this was when it began seriously affect me mentally and emotionally. My grades started dropping and although my health issues weren't nearly as bad as previously, I missed as much school as I could because I hated going. Ultimately, this became a habit, even when the bullying subsided during 8th grade, and I became that kid that is barely in school.

Then comes high school. My freshman year started with the death of a close relative, and then shortly thereafter it was discovered that someone in my immediate family had an opiate addiction. This destroyed my family for pretty much the rest of high school, and my parents were simply absent for that time. All of this, plus my poor eating habits (that had formed as a child), resulted in weight gain of 75lbs from the end of my freshman year to the end of my senior year.

Obviously, this significantly impacted my academics. I hadn't even looked into colleges until my senior year. One thing that I do want to emphasize, is that like in previous years, there were moments in high school when I had consistent attendance, I was driven to do well, and I was almost effortlessly succeeding in my class. And when I say effortlessly, I mean minimal studying and no struggle in learning the material. This was not the case for the majority of high school, and I ended up graduating with a 2.7 GPA.

At the end of my senior year I'd decided to get my shit together and was going to go to a community college so that I could transfer to a top school. For the major I'd wanted, I needed to complete calculus 1, but that meant I would have to place into it. The last time I'd taken calculus was my junior year (got a C), and I placed into something like algebra 2 when I initially took the test. After two weeks of hardly rigorous review, I jumped from placing into algebra 2 to placing into calc 1. And then in my first semester at community college, I aced my Calc course with minimal effort (showed up, took notes, studied a little). I finished that year with a 4.0 in courses that included religion/humanities, calc, stats, history, nutrition, human bio, geology, sociology, and writing. I successfully transferred into the school that I'm currently in.

I began in the business school last fall, but due to a low self esteem from all of my previous experiences, I was quickly overwhelmed, so I panicked and switched majors. I ended up finishing the semester with a 2.86 GPA in only 3 courses and no clue what I was doing moving forward. The spring semester started and ended pretty quickly because I nearly dropped out due to the anxiety I was experiencing from my rather traumatic experience in the fall (there was more to it) and the fact that now, I was taking courses that I hated and I still had no clue what I wanted to do with my life. I took a leave of absence to try and figure things out, which certainly proved to be helpful. Ironically, during my leave of absence, I had another traumatic experience/encounter with a different person in my immediate family abusing drugs. Nonetheless, I'd been seeing a counselor and so I was able to work through those issues with self esteem and I was able to let go of the past.

That brings us to this semester. I should note that I'm down about 100 pounds since I left high school, so I'm feeling pretty great about that, but I still have no clue what I want to do with my life. I've switched a ton of shit around this semester already and I'm super annoyed because I literally have to declare my major next semester or else I could lose financial aid in my last few semesters.

&amp;#x200B;

There's my background, but here is what I'm getting to. High school is obviously a very critical time in which kids are supposed to give their all in their classes so that they can get a feel for their strengths, their interests, and maybe even their passion. My experience was a whole lot different than that, and while I'm very serious about living life with no regrets, I can't help but admit that if I had the chance, I would do it all over again so that my life would be moving in some sort of direction. 

I mentioned that when I did make a conscious effort in my classes, I did very well. I'm currently stuck trying to decide between a social science or humanities major (probably economics unless someone changes my mind). However, I truly feel that if things had gone differently in the beginning, I'd be doing something super interesting in tech like robotics or AI or something of that sort. Maybe I would've ended up on the med school track. Maybe I would've ended up on the law school track. Maybe I'd be killing it on my way to becoming an successful politician or businessman or entrepreneur. And honestly, some of those paths aren't necessarily closed. I could still major in math or physics and go on to get a masters in computer science or robotics or something of that nature. I could still switch to human bio and go to med school. I could still switch to philosophy or history and go to law school. Or I could stick with economics and go off and become an entrepreneur in some field after I graduate.

The problem is, it is A HELL of a lot scarier now. This diploma (with my work/effort of course) is my ticket to move from lower class to upper class, to get access to places and people that I would've never had access to otherwise, to live pretty much anywhere and have job opportunities available. But, I don't know what I like, what I don't like, what I'm good at and what I'm not good at. For me to move into a serious field like tech, medicine or law would be a big jump to make. I still feel very confident that I can succeed in whatever I put my mind too. But if I don't like it? Well then I'd be screwed. But I can't help but wonder what might've been had I taken advantage of high school. So I guess what I'm asking is, practicality considered, is it too late, and if not, than when is it too late?",college,"Looking for advice on how to move forward...

There is a basic course that everyone has to either take or test out of; I tested out. From there, if you're taking a social science or occupational certificate, you take the math class for that path. If you're taking business or STEM, you take the other math class.

I'm going into the social sciences and they signed me up for the STEM/business class.

After the first day today, I asked my instructor why I'm taking this class when the requirements flowchart says otherwise. She told me that I'm taking the wrong class, it will be worth nothing to my degree, and that I should talk to enrollment.

Enrollment told me that **they intentionally sign you up for the wrong class on the assumption that you'll change your major to that path later**. I promptly dropped the class. The best part? It's a late start class with long class times, which means that I couldn't take another course necessary to my degree. Also, the late start math classes that I actually need are all filled now. So instead of taking 5 classes required for my degree, I'm taking 3.

**TL;DR:** CC intentionally signed me up for the wrong class, resulting in me only taking 3 classes rather than 5.

I don’t know how to keep a consistent schedule. I don’t know how to stay organized. I don’t know how to prioritize work. I don’t know how to not get overwhelmed. I don’t know how to work with others. I don’t know how to ask for help, I’m on like a 4th grade math level (I literally have no clue how I passed the math portion of the GED. If I had missed one more point I would have had to retake it.), my English and grammar skills, have deteriorated, etc.

After I got my GED I tried and failed 4-5 different semesters in college. I felt stunted. I wasn’t able to keep up with everybody else. And my embarrassment and lack of confidence instigated my depression and anxiety and would always end up with me taking a leave of absence or quitting half way through and getting horrible grades across the board. I’d asked the accessibilities dept for help, but that mostly resulted in me being able to sign up for classes when the seniors do, because I was having a hard time getting good classes with teachers able to help struggling students.

I know I’m better than this. I know I can do school. It’s just hard because I’m having to make up 12 years of education and habit building in one semester of college.

I checked out my college's clubs, and I don't see any that I'd be interested in. I checked out the gaming club online hoping it was just a casual thing like kick back and play a casual game like Fortnite or whatever is popular and chill, but it turns out that club is more of a competitive club that plays league of legends and stuff like that(not my style at all). Most of the organizations are greek life(not interested), major-specific clubs(not interested, I think a club should be an escape from your major), and a few things I wouldn't be interested in. I'm not really interested in much(I don't have many hobbies, yes I know I'm boring).

1151,new_passion,1534959963,/r/college/comments/99fgsx/got_caught_accidentally_cheating_a_decade_ago_and/,"This happened a decade ago in my college algebra class. The teacher passed out a 5 problem worksheet (not a test). She had handed out a reference worksheet right before. I was the naive 17 year old girl (think “homeschooled”) in the class already nervous as could be. I must have missed when she said “no notes”. 
Basically, she screwed me over. Glared daggers at me, stormed up, and wrote in red ink a big zero and an x on the paper, writing so hard that she ripped through some of the paper. She stormed off with the paper and made a big scene. I was horrified and embarrassed and felt like crying. I sat there shocked for two minutes and then got up and fled to cry in the bathroom and then go home. I was able to withdraw from the class because it wasn’t very far in the semester so it’s a W on my transcript. 

I don’t think that worksheet was even worth 1% of my grade. Could that incident be in my file and come back to haunt me? I dropped out of school over the trauma! I didn’t go back to college for a year and when I did I had no confidence in my algebra and had to do the class below it. When I took college algebra again, I couldn’t stand to go to the class everyday and ended up taking it online!

Now I’m finally pursuing what I really want to do as a more confident and mature adult a decade later. If it’s still on my record and it’ll affect my degree or future job prospects, I’d like to challenge it.

My real passion was to become a vet, but that dream went down the drain because it's too hard to get into vet school and I don't get good enough grades. Mostly B's &amp; C's, a few A's, and a lot of W's because I've withdrawn and dropped out from community college multiple times because I just couldn't handle it. I'm not that motivated and do not want to dedicate so much of my life towards academics. Is that so wrong? Am I bad person? What do I say when others want to shame me for my lack of paid education? I say paid because when I'm not in college I do try to learn things like foreign languages, coding, sewing, and whatever else sparks my interest. In fact, I'm more motivated to learn when I'm not going to college.

I dropped out of college after my first year about a decade ago, leaving with about $20k in debt for my trouble. It's taken me a long time, but I've been able to get myself into a decent position in my life, but I feel unfulfilled and driven toward something else... namely, being a teacher. I've been taking classes here and there and have 41 credits to my name. I want to start taking things to the next level and complete my BA so I can work toward become a certified teacher, preferable as soon as possible. By my reckoning, taking 10 classes a year would get me there before the end of 2021. 

My issue, however, is paying for this. My work offers $5k a year in tuition reimbursement, but that would only cover around 50% of the cost of such an aggressive timeline at my chosen school. In order to complete the degree at the speed I'd want I would need to take out \~$14k in additional debt. This scares me quite a bit, I am terrified that this is throwing good money after bad. I know $34k in student loan debt isn't a huge amount and it's likely better to have a degree with some more debt than no degree and slightly less debt. But still, the fear. 

Can someone offer me some advice or at least some soothing words to stop me from racking my brain on this every few hours?

I live in Australia, so I'll give you a little info on how things work here. I dropped out of high school, so right now I'm doing a diploma in counselling and that gives me entry into psychology at my university of choice.

Basically, I'm crap at maths and I'm not saying that to be cute or modest. I was mentally ill all through high school before dropping out, so I didn't give a shit about the classes or maths and I failed the lowest class. 

I'm great at English and would get A's in the highest class, this year I've surprised myself as well as I'm the top of my class and passing the diploma with flying colours. Now I'm motivated and focused on my education, it seems I can do more than I thought I could.

HOWEVER. I know there is maths involved in psych. I'm a bit terrified of this. I don't want to let it hold me back from doing what I want to do, but I also don't want to pay thousands for a degree I won't be able to pass.

Right now I don’t have enough financing towards my upcoming school year. In terms of a full school year, I only have a couple scholarships worth a total of $2,000, I am only eligible for $5,000 with FAFSA, and $3,000 for work-study. In order to attend college this upcoming year I will need approximately $10,000 ($9,000 if I want to struggle a bit more). I will be working part time but I will only be working 10 hours a week, as it’s all my work-study job offers, and I only make $10 an hour; so I will only be making ~ $360 a month after taxes, which is enough to cover my gas and groceries for the month. In order to fund my education last year, I very reluctantly took out a private and had my grandparents co-sign on it, since they were the first to offer. However, their credit score dropped quite a bit from co-signing and they have said that they will not be willing to co-sign any more. My parents are also refusing to co-sign after seeing what it did to my grandparents credit score. I could also take a year off to work, even I would hate to postpone my education. However, if I’m not mistaken, I’m pretty sure the grace period on my loans would kick in as soon as I drop below half-time enrollment, let alone take a whole year off. Do I have any other options? If so I would appreciate any feedback and advice.

Thoughts of homelessness have crossed my mind but now it´s moving into serious consideration. Is it realistic for me to consider living in my car for a semester? Has anyone here lived in their car or crashed at someone else´s for any amount of time during college?

Here's my deal. I´m moving to attend a CSU in California this fall. I´ve taken out a loan for tuition and between working minimum wage, rent at my parent’s place I have around $1500 in savings. I have a 10 year old car that runs very well. About 100K on it. Rent where I'm headed is $450-$700 mo if I´m lucky. Not that the area is expensive to live in, but housing is super competitive, especially for students, and housing and employment I've found are a huge problem in the area. It´s just insane to me how I´ve found myself in this situation. I was a decent student at my HS, good student in community college, a 3.3 GPA, good credit, never had any scholarships, passionate about the field I´m entering, of course people that doubt it, I work, pay for my own shit, take responsibility for everything I do. Not usually one to play victim but it’s all kinda catching up with me. Irrelevant, but anyway.. I have about a month before school starts and I want to know if I´m crazy or not. I came up with a budget. For 12 months, August 2018-2019, not including tuition I would be paying $600/mo in rent plus a $1k deposit, $130/mo in car insurance, $50/mo for my phone, $150 in food, and let´s say $100/mo for everything else.. Books, gas, etc. might be underestimating a little bit, but that´ll cost me around $11k for the entire school year including summer. Let me repeat, this isn´t including tuition. $6K-$7k of this would be for rent!! Am I batshit crazy for thinking I don´t want to pay for this? I´d never see this money again. I´d much rather invest this into something that I´ll see later on. I´m not interested in taking a year off, always been afraid of dropping out and finding myself stuck in a job I hate. I clearly don't want to wind up in a spiral of debt. My parents are a whole other issue.. Long story, but they cannot help me. My dad is old, divorced from my mom, financially irresponsible with nothing left from a high status government career, got scammed, now has hand tremors and showing early signs of Parkinson´s, which has done a lot of damage to me mentally and emotionally trying to care for him. I developed some pretty bad anxiety over there with only him. My mom is in decent financial shape, she bought the car that is now mine, but has been loaning my financially insane sister money for her rent. My father was supposed to help me out… he defaulted on loans after my sister dropped out of school. I´m a dependent of my mother, for financial aid as well, but I don´t have the best relationship with her. Long story too.. But she might be my best bet at help. It´s all complicated and I feel like it´s all my fault. Should have worked more in high school, figured things out earlier.. Sigh. But now I really need to find a way out of this mess. Back to this fall. Again, theoretically it sounds reasonable because I´m a backpacker and have slept in my car some nights. I don´t know anymore. I feel crazy for all of this. I thought about it all day. I can shower at my school for free, use the wifi and library for free, work out at the gym, work would be super close to campus, and there´s a laundromat in town. But practically speaking, there are huge questions for me. Storing food, parking, privacy, a buttload of more issues most likely. I´m typing this as if I believe in what I´m saying but I´m really just trying to hide how crazy I really feel for actually believing in this all. Is it possible? What should I do? I really don´t want any hate, should´ves, or negative criticism, I already do plenty of that on my own. But I really want to change my life around financially, mentally and go on to do some big things for myself and others. This is the first time truly and honestly reaching out for some help… so I´m just looking for some guidance, support, ideas, someone to tell me I’m overthinking all of this, anxiety getting the best of me, and need to just take out a loan, maybe even a good kick in the ass might help.

Everyday more and more events began occurring that proved to me that I could succeed without a diploma. I looked at it as a fun challenge to purposely make myself become the underdog.

My dad told me that no one would want to work with a dropout. My mom cried everyday for a little while. I understood where they were coming from, but I also knew I had a mission of my own.

If you’re going to school to procrastinate coming into the real world (which is way more fun by the way) with an imaginary safe space, stay in school. If you want to live life to the absolute fullest and do what you want to do, leave school.

School has no relation to how much money you will make. All of the careers you think will make you so much money are going to soon be automated. You need to follow a path of creativity if you actually want to win.

Your ex-classmates will always be there if you need them. Networking is way more effective in real life than meeting people in school or university. The parties in the real world are also way cooler than college parties.

You’re only holding yourself back from your true potential by staying in school. It is not a backup plan and if you make that excuse you are lying.

Dropping out of school will help you get over your fears in life. You’ll realize that dropping out of school won’t actually kill you and that life will always guide you down the right path. You must have absolute faith in yourself and your future.

Here’s what will happen when you drop out:

You will lose your fear of failure. You will learn that everyone starts from the same point even if it doesn’t look like it from the outside. It’s a lot easier to succeed than you think. You remove excuses and begin going toward your goals like never before. You’ll realize that you are extremely creative once you no longer have significant external pressure.

1174,JereBear_2281,1531151641,/r/college/comments/8xcy1m/any_advice_on_my_situation/,"Hello everyone,

Not sure this is the right place for this but I'm going to try.

I need some help, and it's a long story but I'll keep it as short as possible. 

I just finished my freshman year of college, and now I'm worried that I won't have enough financial aid to ride out until the end of my education. I come from a family that is very mixed in it's financial status, as in my father was making absolute bank until he lost his job in 2009 due to mass layoffs which effectively ruined my parents lives, but he's also in consideration for a job that'll pay around $85,000 a year, so that would put them, and possibly by extension me, in a very good financial situation. But I've learned that when planning things it's always best to prepare for the worst, so let's just forget I mentioned that potential new job lol 

Anyways, the college I attended for the 2017 - 2018 school year cost roughly $22,000 a year with room and board, which is a necessity as it's a three hour drive from where I live. So, considering that my degree would require me to attend for five years, that'll roughly be a grand total of $110,000, and I just found out that an undergrad, who is still a dependent, can only take out up to$39,000 in government student loans. About $11,000 of that was used this past year, with grants/free aid covering the rest besides another $5000 that slipped through the cracks, which my parents ended up covering by taking out a loan that they can't afford. So that leaves me with a maximum of $28,000 in government loans and whatever grants and other free aid I get offered to cover $88,000 of college tuition. Now, looking back at how my financial aid for 2017 - 2018 worked out, and considering that my EFC went up a ton just because my sister moved out, my Higher Education award, which everyone gets, has dropped from $5000 to a little over $2000, things aren't looking very good there. Oh, and there's also the issue of your student loan eligibility decreasing every year that you're in school(I haven't fact checked that myself, buy I remember a financial advisor telling me that). 

Also, I've also been an average to slightly below average student when it comes to subjects that aren't within my interest, no matter how hard I work. All the way from 1st grade to my freshman year of college, if it wasn't related to music, art, writing or history, I would suck at it. This left me with a rather mediocre high school GPA, and things only improved slightly during my first year of college. So because of this, my odds of getting scholarships are slim to none, not to say that's kept me from applying, though. Oh, and because I'm a white male from an all white family, it seems like the entire college system assumes that I don't need any help and that I'm already at a much higher advantage than everyone else. Lol. 

So in terms of financial aid, things look pretty damn grim. There's also the option of using as much financial aid as I possibly can, and then applying for private loans, but there's no guarantee I would even get approved for them, and that would leave me at an absoluye, best situation, bare minimum of $50,000 in total debt, if I'm the luckiest person in the world. In reality it'd probably end up being closer to $110,000, maybe around $80,000. And I'm not sure that I want to take on all of that for a career that could write possibly pay sub-$30,000 a year starting out in a seemingly dying field. 

Which segways me into informing you that my current degree path is for a Music Education degree, which I would use to become a high school band director. As far as I'm aware, the only true passion I've ever had was for high school marching band, and to a lesser extent concert band. I never really had any other activities or groups where I felt like I belonged. I tried a couple different sports and a few different clubs, but none of them resonated with me. But I loved marching band and I excelled there, having earned the highest ranks in student leadership within the program. Marching band gave me the same competitiveness factor that you could get from sports, taught me valuable lessons, and gave me an overall sense of purpose. That's why I want to become a high school band director; so I can keep doing what I love while also helping new young people find a passion for it.

Now that all sounds fine and dandy, but when you realize that a high school band director will probably make scraps starting out, sometimes even less than other new educators, and the fact that school systems have been cutting music programs from public school curriculum for a while now, and are still doing so, it starts to seem like a much less viable and worthy option to out $80,000 worth if debt towards, even if it is my passion. There's also the fact that my main drive for this is for the love of the music meets competition aspect, and I'm not sure if someone who is only in it for the competitiveness should be teaching students. 

Although this is my only passion that I've discovered, I'm aware that it's not my only option. Hell, I never even considered that a life-long career. My plan was to ride that out until I was 50 or so and then start my own instrument sales and music lesson business. So keeping that in mind, I've also been toying around with the idea of going to a more local college that I can drive to everyday and pursuing a business management degree with a minor in music. Other interests and skills that I'm not sure what to do with are good-great writing skills, pretty okay visual art skills(mainly drawing), and being totally okay with doing hard work with my hands, getting dirty, and just doing ""tough guy"" work in general. I've also always enjoyed creating things and using my imagination. 

So what do I do? Do I follow my only real passion and try to attain that, even though I know I could be cut short and ruined financially before even attaining my goals? Or should I look for something else that I can pursue that matches my other skills and interests? I just feel so lost and confused right now.

Thanks for any help! 

Edit: Should probably mention that less than 10 colleges in my state offer Music Ed, and they're all at least two hours away, and none of my family leaves near any of them.

Edit edit: Just found out the maximum a dependent undergrad can be offered is $31,000. Yay, even worse.",college,Any Advice On My Situation?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8xcy1m/any_advice_on_my_situation/,1531169641.0

I recently applied to the same school after not finishing following 5 semesters when I was a teen.  I was a Deans list student for 2 of those semesters and then started making horrible life choices and dropped out and didn't even bother actually dropping the classes before the deadline.

I am inclined to think that since I am no longer young and I will not have trouble starting on probation since I am not making the same life choices that I will refuse the amnesty and just let the GPA gradually come up.  Taking this route I will just let my explanation of my final GPA come up in interviews since I am not ashamed of choices I made 25 years ago; I am no longer that person.

Backstory:  I went to college just after high school.  I was optimistic and hopeful.  Honestly though I was terrified.  Young 18 year old who lived what I now know is a sheltered life leaving home for the first time.  I had no idea what I was in for.  The first year I kept my head above water pretty well.  Not the greatest but I feel I did well for all the crap my freshman roommates put me through. (Mini tl;dr: lots of sex with me trying to sleep on the top bunk, lots of alcohol and parties in our apartment. Etc.)  After the first year I should have stopped.  But at the urging of my mother I kept at it.  My grades and my overall wellbeing slowly fading into the abyss.  After my 3rd year I dropped out.  I couldnt take it anymore.  I felt like a failure.  I was so ashamed.  Why could everyone else do alright at college but it was so hard for me?  What was wrong with me?  Nearly a decade later I came to realize that I want to go back.  This time to a community college instead of a university.  I have a therapist and a set of medications as well as a strong support system.  I was on academic suspension which I read means I am no longer eligible for financial aid but I am confused.  Forever? Or just until a certain time? If I cant get aid  Thats okay.  I intend to pay 100% out of pocket.  My only problem os that I won't be able to get my old transcript because of an old loan.  I would pay it but I can't get a hold of them to pay and the school won't release my papers until I pay it.






So my questions:
1. What is an academic suspension?
2. Do I have to give my new school the old transcript? (I had shit grades so id have to retake the classes anyway) 
3. Am I allowed to just start over?

First year, first generation student here. I started my first year of CC, and fell in love with it. On September 30th (mid 1st semester) I was in a semi severe car accident that left a small financial burden on me. Luckily insurance covered a fair amount, and I even called my mom to take me to the hospital because ambulances were expensive. Well I lost my job because of the incident, so medical costs were handled by my savings. The injury kept me out of class for 3 weeks, and with no internet/computer I had no options of viewing online lecture slides. I dropped 2 of my 4 classes because I knew I fell too far behind. I have a documented email to one of my professors detailing the injury, and my struggle to make up for lost work. 

Second semester rolled around and I had no money, and no job. I enrolled for classes because I was too prideful to take a semester off to find work and save up, and it killed me. I couldn't pay for books and again, I dropped classes stupidly, not knowing I was on probation. 

That leads us to now. I plan on appealing it. I am motivated and love school. There is one problem though. Obtaining my medical records will take up to 30 days. My registration date is the 26th, and would love to get the classes that offer me the most success. So I come to you reddit. Do appeals ever even work? I have billing info of only my physical therapy, an email detailing the injury, photos from the scene, and my notes and essays (showing I am an engaged student). Should I go now, and inform them of that any awaiting medical information can be provided, or do I wait until I get it?

I’d really appreciate advice. So here’s the situation. I took the California High School Proficiency Exam which basically gives you the equivalent of a high school diploma, so I was able to start college at 15 (nearly 16).  This was great and gave me a huge head-start, but I  didn’t have any AP credits and so I had to take a lot of lower division classes like College Algebra and Trig (I’m currently a computer science major). 
So my first year went really well, thank God, but here’s where it gets tricky. Since I have to take a bunch of lower division classes, I’m on a really tight schedule and I have to take like 18 units a semester. I was enrolled in Calculus 2 for summer session, but my professor was ridiculous. I spent 8 hours a night on homework, minimum, and he gave me 0s for leaving out irrelevant notation. No partial credit, whatsoever. Needless to say, I realized this class would ruin my GPA, so I dropped it(luckily, it was right before the “withdraw” period began!). The problem is, Calc 2 is a prerequisite for my other math classes. 

Now I’m confused on wether I should stay for an additional year. If not, I could still apply to UCI which only requires up-to Multivariable Calculus, but I wouldn’t be able to apply to my dream school, Berkeley. Don’t get me wrong UCI is a great school, but I really want to go to Cal. If I stayed for an extra year at CC, It would allow me to apply to UCLA, and Cal’s CompSci programs. The problem is, I’ve heard certain schools don’t accept you if you go over a certain amount of units. And most (prestigious) privates don’t accept transfers who’ve stayed in CC for more than 2 years. It’s not like I’m in a huge rush, since I started college early, but I feel like I’d rather spend an extra year in university and minor in something than spend an extra year in community college completing (semi?)useless major requirements.

 Before the body, I'm sorry for my poor English.  


I'm a south korean, male, 21. I finished my mandatory duty a few month ago. So I has been idle now.  
There was a college I attended, But recently I dropped out of this school for some reason. I really didn't like that school, so I only finished one semester of freshman before being drafted.  


Lately, I got a new dream: studying in the US and eventually emigrating to US. However, as you know, US college is expensive and it's hard to afford; my family isn't wealthy. Moreover, I don't have anything to apply: SAT/ACT score, mediocre GPA \(my mental problem and korean secondary education is oriented final college exam\), mediocre English ability \(perhaps influential to write an essay\) and decisively I don't have any good EC and strong relationship to get a recommendation letter.  


Thus entering as a freshman in the US college is impossible for me. so I decide to set plan like this:  
1. Taking korean college exam to attend korean university.  
2. During my korean college life, Growing myself as far as I can. \(Getting a perfect GPA from tough/core course and recommendation letter, Writing strong Essay, Building many good EC\)  
3. Applying to university as a transfer applicant.  


Of course, I know that universities whose need\-blind policy for international student are Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT.  
I'm going to apply these schools and also know that these schools are very very competitive. Transfer application as an asian\-international is even more competitive.  


But I personally think that chance for me to upcoming decision is literally zero. My plan seems rare and unlikely, but not zero, I guess.  


If my plan would fail, I'd consider to enter PhD program in the US with funding. My goal is to be a researcher on economy or cs. So even if I'd get failure, I believe I can endure it.

I enrolled in a program at my state university that advertises being 100&amp;#37; online. It's not. 

My first class was amazing, it was actually 100&amp;#37; online and I aced it. Which would be the first time in university history I've aced a class \(I dropped out of college twice previously\). 

This upcoming class said in the course description that it was 100&amp;#37; online, but it's not. The tests are required to be taken on\-campus. This is okay, but I'm also kind of annoyed and nervous because:

a\) I have a habit of getting lost on college campuses

b\) Which then causes me to be late to class 

c\) I get terrible test anxiety

d\) I haven't signed up for accommodations yet, and the class starts in 2 weeks 

e\) I work full\-time

f\) I'd be taking off 2\-3 hours of work every couple weeks

g\) I'm paying an extra $200 for the class because it's ""100&amp;#37; online""

h\) I'll be spending extra money on gas on top of the '100&amp;#37; online' fee 

So it's not a HUGE deal, I just wish I would've known about it before signing up for the class \(because to be perfectly honest, I probably wouldn't have signed up for it\). 

I'm discovering a few of the classes aren't offered online at all. So I'm not sure whether or not I should drop this class, drop the whole course and transfer to an actual online school, stick it out for this semester and then transfer, or stick it out for all the semesters. 

I'm just really nervous because I've failed before and the last class I took was the first one I've done really well in. Online courses are SO much easier for me and I'm way less distracted when I'm in my own quiet house with my own strict routine.

1189,comprehensivepeak,1527434447,/r/college/comments/8mielg/changing_major_from_anthropology_to_a_stem_major/,"-English is not my native language and I wrote this in a hurry, please excuse any mistake-

I'm 19yo. I started a physical anthropology major this year. The college system is different here, you pick your major before starting it and changing it is nearly impossible. I also have ADHD, and I feel like my poor coping mechanisms during high school led to a skewed image of my abilities. I was always the 'humanities' guy, and my environment was highly supportive of that, even my teachers. They used to regard me as smart but uninterested on the hard sciences. My chemistry teacher told me to avoid any degree with chemistry in it, for my own good. She said it in a jokingly manner, but I kind of took her and other's advice very seriously. I was just 'not interested', I supposed. Turns out I do enjoy chemistry and mathematics, I took a linear algebra and a chemistry class this year and really enjoyed them.

I've already dropped a major before, and I feel very tempted to do it again. The problem is that this time it would take a greater effort to do so. I would have to take the admission tests again, do REALLY well on them, and hopefully get offered a new scholarship/loan. I would lose a monthly payment I'm currently receiving from the government, so that probably means I would have to seriously consider a part-time job. I would also have to move from my current apartment. My parents would get very upset, and I don't blame them.

The change I'm considering is from physical anthropology to a hard science major. Probably biochemistry. I got into my current major because of forensics, archaeology, evolution, linguistics, and cognition. I feel like I would better understand most of those things with a strong biology/chemistry background rather than the classes I'm currently taking. Linguistics and the cultural aspect of it makes for a way better hobby than self-studying organic chemistry and calculus. I'm seriously considering pursuing neuroscience after I'm finished, and it would be way harder to do it with my current major (though still possible). My current major does have a couple of hard science classes (general chemistry, cellular biology, molecular biology) but I feel it's not enough.

My dad told me last year that this time I was 'not allowed' to drop the major again, and that I could study something else after finishing my current degree. It's not that crazy to consider it since I do enjoy this major. But getting a second bachelor's once I'm 23-24 years old sounds highly unrealistic.

Lastly, my constant changes of mind really frustrate me. I'm the typical jack of all trades, master of none. The reason why I'm asking this here is that I'm not 100% sure of this interest shift. I feel like spending 4-5 years in a hard science degree would be way more valuable than a physical anthropology degree, but at the end of the day I enjoy both (from my limited experience, though). Unfortunately, I will always wonder 'what if'.

First Field: I have a longstanding interest in psychology, as Aspergers caused me to develop social skills by reading technical articles. I also have a fascination with psychoactive drugs and the effects they can have on minds, bodies, and groups. This makes my first interest in the field psychopharmacology/psychiatry, with the goal of being able to run or participate in research on legal and illegal substances to create recreational safe use guides and search for more medical uses of the drugs. This would take 6-10 years of schooling and a lot of in-field establishment before being able to work on projects of my choice/design.

My second interest in the field is addiction therapy, as it fits the interests above, and I’ve both been around and gone through addiction myself. This would take 2-6 years of schooling, and likely end up being a stepping stone into the above career.

Second field: I have some training and freelance experience in computer science, an easier field in terms of schooling/starting/progressing by far, but not exactly my ""passion"" anymore. I have about even experience in web design/development, game design/development, cybersecurity (penetration testing), app development, and home automation.

I only went to the college I went to because it was legit in my backyard by hopping a few fences and my buddy convinced me to go to college with him since it was a cheap community college route for a couple years (he dropped out since). 

Took me 6 years to graduate and I’m not even remotely interested in what I went to school for (Public Health) but I landed a job in social work as a Clinician Assistant and I really enjoy it, I’ve only worked with Drugs and Alcohol clients but it’s really interesting to me. I’m not looking to make 6 digits. I would rather be happy with my work than make 6 digits and hate my life climbing the corporate ladder like some of my friends. 

So I was thinking of going back to get Masters in Social Work because I can make enough money for what I want in life hopefully, which isn’t much. 

How do I decide what school to go for Masters in SW and how do I decide what route to take because it looks like there are different Masters I can get in SW?

I make 32k a year and have zero finical support from my family, so money for schooling would matter because it would be more debt I would go in and I don’t want to have 80k in loan debt by the time I get my Masters. I have 50k now because of accumulating interest.

1195,jgh713,1526326466,/r/college/comments/8jf595/an_education_in_shambles_please_advise/,"Hi.

So, I'm not going to sugar-coat it. I fucked up. Big time.

Lets start in high school. Graduating with a 3.8+ GPA, 2180 on the SATs, breezing through classes, taking career prep (engineering and CS) courses. Not a care in the world. Took a trip Junior year to tour Stanford (as well as my #2 and #3 choices, CalTech and Cal Poly), and everything seemed good.

Fast forward five years, I'm sitting at home, unemployed, my education in shambles, struggling with mental illness, and have no clue what to do at this point.

It started when I missed the application deadline for Stanford. I probably wouldn't have gotten in, but hey, it was my dream, and at least I could have said that I tried. After that point, I decided to go to a local 4-year university (U. Texas at Arlington), as they're a decent school, not too far of a commute, and not ridiculously expensive. I commuted for a year, then lived on campus for a year. At that point, everything fell apart.

*Fall of 2013*

My first semester. Things were fine. I commuted to classes, got my ass kicked by a few professors while trying to come to grips with the transition from high school to college. Ended up with a 2.0 gpa my first semester. Not great, but not unheard of, and still passing.

*Spring 2014*

My second semester of commuting. I flunk one class, then get Cs across the board, bringing my gpa down to 1.85. 

*Summer 2014*

I take some summer courses at a local community college. Get the easy courses out of the way. I'm still slightly together at this point, and these classes are basically show up and pass, so I A/B/B across the board. In hindsight, I should have waited and taken them at the university, to have some hope of pulling my GPA back up, but we're long past that point now.

*Fall 2014*

I move into the dorms. Start living on campus. At this point my ADHD and severe depression kick into overdrive. I stop attending classes after a point in the semester. Stop tending to my health and hygiene. .462 gpa for the semester, bringing me down to a 1.4.

*Spring 2015*

Still living on campus. My roommate is the nicest guy, but probably thinks I'm horrid to live with. Not because I'm an asshole, just because I don't take care of anything. Most of my waking hours are spent wasting away on the computer, either watching endless tv series or playing video games. I fail every single class, mostly because I've stopped caring. My gpa is now at a 1.077, and I am put on dismissal for a semester.

*Summer 2015* 

Take four summer courses at TCC (the aforementioned community college). Withdrawn from all but one for non-attendance. Get a C in the one class I'm not withdrawn from, because I actually enjoyed the teacher. It's somewhere around this point (give or take six months) where my already very very part time job starts to go downhill, and my hours worked go from minimal to nonexistent.

*Fall 2015*

Still on dismissal (one long term, i.e. spring or fall, not just one term), so I take some more courses at TCC. Four courses. Pass three. Fail one (but this one's due to the professor who threatened to file a police report and haul me down to campus police for correcting him in class. no joke. but that's a story for a different time).

*Spring 2016*

Hey, a fresh start! Not really though. Once more, I fail every single class, bringing my gpa at UTA down to 0.848. Aaaaaand, I'm on academic dismissal for a whole 'nother year. So now I'm three years in, on dismissal for the next year, and have completed a total of 28 credit hours at UTA, with some additionals from TCC. Lovely.

Silver lining, this is the semester during which I actually seek help from a medical professional. I've spoken to those close to me (as few as they may be at this point, as I've neglected my social life as much as the rest of my life at this point), I'm on medication to help manage my issues, and I'm also eating less and getting back towards a healthy weight (slowly but surely). But we'll come back to that.

*Summer 2016*

Welp. Back to TCC I suppose. Start working towards that 2-year degree during my fourth year of schooling. Take three classes. Pass two. PhysEd instructor has a thing for pilates and the class starts at 7:30 in the morning, so I said fuck that. Sue me.

*Fall 2016*

Slowly struggling to come to terms with what's happened. Take two classes, pass one, fail the other. Don't even remember why.

*Spring 2017*

Three classes, all passed. Only two courses away from an Associates. Things are looking up!

*Summer 2017*

Took my last two classes. Realized I only needed one of them. Thought I dropped the other, turns out I didn't, so I failed one. But hey, no biggie, summer's over and I've finally got a degree after four years and three months!

*Fall 2017*

Was too late at this point to return to UTA for the fall, so I took a semester off. And by that, I mean I fell off the bandwagon. I stopped taking my meds for several months, and most of my waking hours were spent trying to kill time until I finally got back to the blissful release of sleep.

Towards the end of the semester, I get in touch with UTA, preparing to return in the spring. Am given the runaround for awhile, but finally set up a meeting with a counsellor and talk in person. He basically tells me that at this point, I'll be returning on a provisionary basis, if I fuck up one semester I'm out for good, which I expected. However, I'd also have to go through the University Studies program, which (in his words) is a program for people to get degrees who otherwise wouldn't be able to get those degrees. I'd be spending two more years struggling to pull my GPA out of the trash so that I could even graduate (which he said would probably be possible, but incredibly difficult), all to graduate with a generic degree that's really not going to help me at all. So at this point, what little remains of my plans is just shattered.

*Spring 2017*

So here we are. Me. A several year gap with no work experience. Nothing but a two-year degree and two shitty GPAs to show for it. No clothes for a professional work environment. (That's not entirely true, I have one suit from goodwill with patched holes, and one white dress shirt that you can see through and that's so tight No clue what to do now. I barely have $100 in my bank account (taking into account credit card debt totals me out at about -$1100, actually), so I can't do as people keep telling me and just apply to whatever colleges will take me ($75 application fee on a Texas CommonApp college, seriously UNT?). Hell, even online universities have turned me away out of hand because of my GPA, despite being in direct contact with advisors and filling out supplementary application information and forms to explain my situation and the troubles I've gone through, and honestly I just don't think I can handle much more rejection, be it for schools, jobs, personal interactions, or what have you.

So, yeah. Long story short, I'm a self-taught programmer who can type at 90 words per minute, am a fast learner with a thirst for knowledge, have above-average skill in writing, mathematics, and logical reasoning, and utterly fucked my life up with a 4-year university gpa of 0.84 before being told to shove it, a 2.3 gpa for my Associates from a community college, a multiple-year gap in my employment history (none of which is really applicable to any place I'd ever possibly hope to work), and absolutely zero idea what the fuck to do. I'm so tired of filling out job applications, putting in (sometimes, depending on the job) upwards of an hour just modifying resumes and writing cover letters, and not even hearing back from a place, or getting a two-sentence generic reply. I've spent the past five months sitting at home going back and forth between filling out applications to places I've never heard of and trying to kill the time until I get to just lay down in bed and not worry about things for awhile, mostly either through video games or shitty tv shows. All I want is to be able to support myself. That's all I've ever wanted. Well, that and maybe a dog someday. But, jokes aside, I really just can't do it anymore, and I don't know what to do. If you're still reading at this point, by some miracle, please advise. At this point my post is devolving and like 90% of the reason I'm writing it is just for therapeutic value, but I need something more, man. I just don't know what to do with myself.

I know a few people who frequent this subreddit. If you know who I am, idk. I suppose you deserve to know as much as anyone. I'm just tired of telling everyone around me that everything is going fine because 99% of the time if I don't it's either my fault or it comes off as whiny (varies based on which person I'm talking to, not the situation I'm talking about). But yeah. Idk. Here I am, most of my family estranged, social interactions are down to two or three friends I speak to on a regular basis, and basically terrified of meeting new folks because of how absolutely embarrassed I feel talking about myself (What do you do? Oh. Well, where did you go to school? Oh. Well, do you have any hobbies? Oh, etc etc). I've been hanging by a thread for years, and I've been here for so long that I just don't know how to pull myself up anymore. I know this probably feels like a pity party at this point in the post, and I'm sorry mister or missus internet stranger that actually took the time to read it, I just needed to vent, I guess.

I was very ignorant at first about how financing an adult life, let alone an education works, but I've learned a lot in the past 3 years. My mother has her own debt, yet no degree, so she wanted me to figure it out on my own like how she had to. ***

My 1st go: Went straight out of HS to community college at age 18 as a Linguistics major, death in the family mid-semester, I dropped out due to depression, earned 4 Ws and $2.5k of debt that was sent to collections in 2016.

2nd go: Age 19, I started an out-of-state community college as a Math major. I completed 1 online English class but dropped an online Precalculus class because the textbook and materials were too expensive. It was too late in the semester to add another class. I earned a W in Precalc, a C in English, and because I dropped below 6 credits, I lost my financial aid and earned $2.8k in debt to be paid back immediately and could not enroll the next semester. 

3rd go: Now at age 20, I'm currently enrolled in a different, out-of-state community college as a Computer Science major. I took 4 classes online (2 Computer Science related and 2 Humanities classes) this Fall 2017-Spring 2018 year. Earned 4 Cs and $5500 in Federal Loan debt. 

My 4th go is coming up. I'm about to pay off the $2.5k debt from my 1st go to my local community college pretty soon. I'll be using federal loans to pay for my classes (and at some point in the next year, pay off the $2.8k debt from my 2nd go). 

If I decide to start this Fall, I'll be 21 and still a freshman. Whatever ego I have left is really damaged by this. However, because my friends don't even have to work and take 5 classes a semester while still partying weekly, I have an inferiority complex about not being in college, which is why I keep enrolling. Also, deep down, I just don't want my family to be ashamed of me if I don't get my Bachelor's.

My community college has a transfer agreement with a top ~60 university for any major. So I feel like if I did do the 4 years, I would get a good degree, some version of the ""college experience,"" and the opportunity to study abroad. But what if I can't handle the workload and/or the finances, end up dropping out again, and with even more debt. What if I graduate and can't find a good-paying job and I end up living as a slave to my debt like my mother? I've changed my major every time I started a new school and I honestly don't want to be a CS major anymore (I hate programming). I've taken over 100 career tests and still don't have an idea of what is the right educational plan for me.

Military is not for me,
I'm not the entrepreneurial type either,
Currently working part-time at a daycare and its made me realize I'm not cut out for ""people-facing"" careers.
If I didn't feel like I was so dumb/horrible at school, and it was free, I might consider a PhD because I love doing research. Besides that, my only true skills (literally the only 2 things I'm good at) are learning languages and listening to music. But I wouldn't study language/music because I'm terrified of struggling to get by every payday like my family members.

I don't have another adult in my life I can have deep conversations with anymore, so any advice at all is welcome. 

TL;DR: Horrible track record with (community) college and I'm starting to think college might not be for me. I'm starting to feel like my time is running out but I don't know what other options are good for me (not interested in military, entrepreneurship). What would you say to a 21 year old who isn't yet progressing towards a career?

1197,TeufeIhunden,1525885243,/r/college/comments/8i7ki7/dont_know_how_you_guys_do_it/,"Dropped out for the third and final time today. I’m officially done with school. Can’t do it. I’m 28 and it’s taken me 10yrs and 3 attempts to make it through one semester of a community college. I just don’t understand how people do this shit. Or even enjoy school, how is that possible? School legitimately makes me want to kill myself. I even planned it over a few classes. Thought about what I would write in a suicide note. What accounts I would need to close. I would just hop in a shower, close the curtain, lay down and put a bullet in my head. Suicide seriously seems like a better option than sitting in classes to me

The only reason I even stuck it out this semester was because I have the GI Bill which is paying me $2,000/month to be in school. Some people say you couldn’t pay them to go to school, that’s actually the case for me. Blows my mind that most students actually put themselves in massive amounts of debt just to be in school. I can’t comprehend doing that

Also pretty sure I have ADHD, I don’t like to self diagnose but there’s something wrong with my head. I just can’t pay attention to anything. Physically, I’m in class, but mentally I’m in another universe. I day dream in every class to the point where I don’t respond if the teacher calls my name. Every time I walk out of class, I just think, I have no fucking clue what we talked about in class. Even reading books I usually read only 2-4 pages at a time. That’s about how long my attention will last before I start dreaming again. So I usually read a few pages, take a break, and then repeat. Sometimes I just close the book, stare at the ceiling for a few minutes and then get back to the book. I don’t know how people sit down and read all day.

It kind of blows my mind how 18 year olds can go to Ivy League schools and be fine. I’m fucking 28 and can’t even hack a community college. Hell, one of my classes is a remedial math class where I’m learning elementary/middle school material and I’m not even doing well. What makes it worse is that both my two siblings have 4 degrees between them from 4 really good (and expensive) schools. How can they manage school so easily but I can’t?

Not sure what I’m going to do from here. Already done the military, schools a big fuck no, I guess that leaves trades. Although none of the trades even remotely interests me. Might just have to suck it up and do it for the rest of my life. I think I’ll give myself until 35 or so.

I'm good at math and am currently majoring in general mathematics, but I'm not really sure that I love it. I'm not sure what I really would love to do tbh. I was considering accounting but I'm just not sure.

My overall GPA is a 3.243 because of the low grades I received in my CS and Spanish classes(I originally was dual majoring in CS and Spanish, dropped Spanish to focus more on CS).

Our TA grades like she is a fucking medical school applicant reviewer or something. Its infuriating especially when I've heard the other TA's are really lenient in their grading.

My lab sessions average grade on our midterm paper was like a fucking 72, but the class average as a whole on the paper was like an 88. Our labs grades were significantly lower than like whole entire class and there is no curve.

We just recently did a group presentation for our project in our class. The other TA's gave out like 100's and 90's left and right. Our TA gave us a fuxking C and idk how. Like I looked at the rubric and compared it with our presentation and we literally ticked all the boxes to get an A. I checked her grading remarks and she took off like 3 points (out of 30) because in one of our slides we said ""effect"" instead of ""affect"".

One slide on our 15 page PowerPoint presentation had an incorrect word and she dropped out whole grade down to a 90.

She dropped 3 more points because there was ""an uneven amount of presenting between group members"". I did most of the presenting because my group members did not like to talk in front of others. So we compromised and they made the PowerPoint and I did the presenting. It was equal amounts of work, but apparently that didnt float her boat. So now, just on those two minor things, we dropped to an 80. She took off two more points because we accidentally didnt italizice the t-test values on our results slide. Like duck you lady.

It is so goddamn frustrating. I am now at a C in the class because of how significantly harder she grades than everyone else. I've gone to every class, done well on every quiz, have done all the homework, got an A on the midterm, but since our paper and lab grades are worth like 40 percent of the class I am at a C because of how much of a nazi she is with grading

Back story:  
I came to the US in order to get into NYU, which always been my dream school. 
I worked very hard at community college &amp; ended up applying to NYU Arts &amp; Science for Econ as a transfer with a 3.8, a tech start up internship, involvement at NYU itself, and a lot of ECs related to my major. I speak 5 languages and my English is now fluent (I believe). Along with that I submitted 2 letters of recommendations, one of my finance professor and one of my advisor/faculty mentor who wrote about me leading my schools team for the Fed Challenge.  

I talked to many people, professors, NYU transfer &amp; Econ students, literally everybody told me I’m a shoe in and i shouldn’t “stress”, that i would get in so I was pretty positive.

I got rejected and did NOT expect it. NYU was the only college I applied to. (Dumb I know, don’t tell me)

My lease is up May and I have a flight to Paris May 28 so I’m VERY stressed about what’s next. 

Now my alternatives in the US are, since most deadlines passed, either 
1) stay at my community college and finish to get my associates (I got one last semester)
2) going to Baruch (automatic transfer since I go to CUNY) or Fordham which I’m not fond of. 

That would mean I’ll have to come back to the US, reapply for a visa, find a place, get a storage etc etc. which is basically annoying. 
I’m not even sure that I can transfer if I choose 1) because I been at this community college since Fall 2015 (took me longer to graduate because I had an F and dropped a class)

I recently started reevaluating staying in the US. 
I am thinking about going back to Paris to transfer my credits to American University of Paris so I would’ve not wasted my time and money. 

The main reason for me wanting to go back home is, in the 3 years I’ve been living in the states, i been very depressed and alone. I have no family members, relatives or friends in the USA. I know some people from school but I don’t have close friends. I truly miss my parents and home in general. I basically feel like I wasted my time living here but it is what it is. 

My main concern is, is it a good idea?
I plan to go to grad school in England or the US.

Should I transfer to American University of Paris (which is waaaay cheaper than a low tier US college AND I get financial aid since I’m french, also I’ll be rent free) or stick it in and go to Baruch/Fordham?
Would I be able to get into a good grad school if I get my bachelors from American University of Paris ? 

I was seeking prestige when coming here but at this point I need to pick the best option for me &amp; my career goals. 

My parents can’t give me advice or connect me to opportunities like some kids so the school I choose is kinda a big factor that’s why I’m so stressed out. 

Thanks a LOT for any advice. I love Reddit it feels like a family I can reach to.

I started out undeclared just doing the gen eds that everyone needs. I did enjoy my sociology class and my psychology class but I don't see myself as a social worker and I remember the psych professor saying you need a masters to really get anywhere in that field. In Spring 2015 I was finishing up gen eds. In Fall 2015 thought I would try Information Systems. My Sister died in the summer of 2015 and in the fall of 2015 i dropped out after about a week due to not having the motivation for school for obvious reasons. I went back spring 2016 and went for bussiness managment /marketing degree because I thought I didn't like the computer classes. I didn't really enjoy the business classes and lost the motivation again. I moped around depressed for about a year doing nothing.

In the summer of 2017 i regained my motivation and took summer business classes. After not really enjoying those I thought I would try to go back to Information Systems because I never really gave it a proper a try. I talked with my adviser and since business and Information majors have classes that overlap I took a little bit of each for the Fall 2017.Because I thought I worked better with machines than people I settled on Information Systems. This spring after taking java and not doing well nor enjoying it I do not know what to do next. Finals are next week and I have not decided for what I'm doing next semester.

I went to my schools career center and after taking a test and talking with the counselor she suggestion a Mass Communications major. But I'm very unsure about this as it didn't sound too appealing. 

Also I should add due to my social anxiety i have never had a job. This summer I wanted to get a job any job so i could have something to do. However academically I do not know what I should do next. The fastest way to graduation would be just go back to business and finish that.

In highschool some of the classes i enjoyed more were history, digital art,English and mainly humanities type stuff, Science was cool too but I am not very good at math. My interest are music, videogames and creative type stuff(I'm not an artist).

I’m 24, a college student in Louisiana, and have just recently began my first semester back at college. 
I went to a small local college in my hometown after I got my GED, but unless you wanted to be a nursing student (I had no interest in that) you were basically SoL at that school. It was cheaper than a larger college, and I did complete enough courses to be a sophomore before I quit, because my father was very ill, shortly after he died, and I never really got over losing my best friend.
From there I worked a couple jobs for years. (I.E. Walmart, Lowe’s, and the like.) 
I even got a job all the way out in Northern California for about 4-6 months for a family friend. Which went well until it didn’t anymore.
I had a pretty terrible relationship that ended in me feeling lost and out of place.
As if that weren’t enough of my bad luck, a guy ran a red light a few weeks back and totaled my truck that my dad left me. It wasn’t anything shiny and new, but that old yellow ranger had a lot of sentimental value to me.
So I started back at a large 4 year university to get a CiS degree.
I’m constantly feeling like I’m an idiot now that I’m starting back at school. I had to drop a math class because it was like gibberish to me, and I’m trying to study everything he covered before I dropped so that next semester I have a chance of passing.
It’s like trying to think through molasses sometimes. I’m a pretty bright guy most of the time, and my biggest issue is that I never had to study in high school, I just got it. Now it’s too much information, and not general knowledge.
I’m trying my best to keep it all afloat, but it still feels like I’m sinking. If that makes any sense?
My savings are rapidly depleting, but I know if I go back to working full time somewhere I won’t be able to concentrate on schoolwork. 
I’m a smoker, and I’m pretty sure I’ll get flak for it, but I just gotta. 
I’m also trying to learn coding as I can through code academy, but it’s slow going until I can get my grades under control.
I’ve got a bad back, or I’d have just kept on throwing boxes and hating it.
It’s just starting to feel like no matter what I do something goes wrong. 
Also I’m not very social. I have a few good friends out of town I see every so often. And the thought of just talking to people in class who don’t start a conversation with me seems terrible.

I’m sorry, this might get long. Currently, it’s 1:40 in the morning and I feel like blowing my brains out. I’ve been working on an essay/presentation for 5 hours and am nowhere near done but I’m so stressed I just want to give up and take the zero but I can’t. 

A little background: I’m in the honors program because it’s the only way I can afford to go to my community college. I’m taking four classes and on top of that working full time for my families vending business.

Life fucking sucks right now. I have to perform well in school to stay in the honors program or I won’t have enough money to pay the tuition fees which wouldn’t be a problem for me if it wasn’t for my parents. Last semester I didn’t have to work much and breezed through my four classes without a grade under a 96%. This semester I’m struggling to get just one A. My parents are struggling financially and it’s completely their fault yet they’re blaming me.

My parents fucking suck with money. They will sit me down and tell me I’m not working enough and the family is struggling financially and it’s my fault but that same week take a trip to California. My mom doesn’t have a job and offers to get one but my dad won’t let her because that extra $1000 a much in his words, “Won’t help with shit.” So while I’m trying to help with bills, I’m also taking a full schedule at school, trying to pay for my car, and trying to find insurance for my car because they dropped me from our insurance. My dad also hurt his back a couple weeks ago and still can’t do almost a thing so now I’m the only person that can work the business which involves servicing vending machines at over 450 locations across three states.

Isn’t this just fucking fantastic? I feel like I’m actually losing my mind guys. I’m sorry about ranting so much but I don’t have anyone I can talk to about this because my problems are my family.

1211,CarpeDiempreecha,1524459635,/r/college/comments/8e90oi/i_dropped_out_of_college_with_a_terrible_gpa_with/,"TL;DR After dropping out of university, I applied for the only local school in my area that I felt had a program both suited to my career aspirations and was well within my level (at least by my high school transcript's standards), but was rejected today. I am completely unsure of how to proceed from here.

Here is my situation (everything up to the bulleted list can be skipped if you don't care):

5 years ago, I was accepted to a prestigious out-of-state university after high school. Following a fairly typical pattern of laziness, procrastination, stress, depression, and anxiety, I had put myself into a corner by the end of my 3rd year. My grades were awful and I was put on academic probation, but I was afraid to completely change my major because it was still ultimately what I was interested in. Additionally, there were not that many other majors offered at my school that would lead to career prospects I would be interested in pursuing. Wasting time, credits, and money was also a big concern, but in retrospect that should have been the least of my worries.

By the time I was halfway through what should have been my 4th year, the academic probation had become suspension, and I had been halfheartedly attempting to follow a readmission program, being unwilling to accept that I needed to take time off and thus alienate myself from my peers. Ironically, I had wasted far more resources than I already had by refusing to give in and attempting to pivot to different but similar majors, as well as taking then dropping classes I needed to do well in to be considered for readmission. The situation had reached critical mass, and I realized that there was no chance that I would be able to salvage the situation the way I was at the time. I finally decided that no amount of counseling sessions or self-motivation tactics would be enough for me to turn things around all at once, and that I should cut my losses, drop out, and move back home to give myself time to reevaluate myself and my situation.

At home, I spent several months almost entirely lazing about and attempting to recover from the mental trauma accompanying the decision to drop out and all that followed. I wasn't ready to apply to schools for the following spring semester at the time, so I didn't even bother. Eventually I decided to collect myself a little bit and consider my options for the fall application deadlines. The thought process went roughly as follows:

- Moving back to try for readmission at my school again is a last resort option. Though I do want to stay on the same major path, doing so at that school would be near impossible, as I would be unable to retake classes that I passed, despite my working knowledge of those classes being shaky at best, nonexistent at worst. The insurmountable gap created by 3 years worth of compounding ignorance had been one of the primary reasons I gave up in the first place, after all.
- I could try reapplying for a completely different, ""easier"" major at my school, but that would be a massive waste of resources, including having to move cross-country again, for questionable return, especially if it was a major I did not have any interest in. And that's assuming that I am confident that I could even excel in that ""easy"" major in the first place.
- The best bet would probably be to go to a local or semi-local school, such a state school, that offers a program in the major I am interested in, and is feasible to get accepted into.
- Unfortunately, it seems that all schools would require me to apply as a transfer applicant, and despite having a promising high school application, my college transcript does me no favors.

With all this in mind, I found one state school within driving distance of my home that had a promising program perfectly suited to what I was looking for. This was the only school that was conveniently located, had a suitable program, and was of a level where I believe I would have had no trouble being admitted out of high school, but was still fairly well regarded. After talking to my family, I decided that I would solely apply to this school, as no other school I could find fit all of those needs. If I got rejected here, there were certainly no better or comparable options that I could count on. I emailed the admissions office with various questions and explanations of my situation, and received several informative replies, as well as one rather curt response saying that if my GPA was that bad, I should try to get my GPA back up at a community college before applying.

I didn't, and still don't, consider this a viable option, as the sheer amount of failed classes on my transcript would mean that I would have long since graduated from the community college before getting my grades to an acceptable level. The response worried me, and I understood that there were no guarantees, but I couldn't think of any better options, so I put my application together, replete with a suggested letter of appeal explaining my situation and a letter from the counselor I had to see at my previous school as part of the readmission process, and sent it in.

That was several months ago, and I waited until today, when I received notice of my rejection. I had really hoped for this not to be the case, but it was not completely surprising either. The problem is that I now have no idea how to proceed, as that was by far and away the best option I could think of. I've looked up many posts and guidelines for applying to college as a drop out, but none of them addressed the issue of a tragic irreparable GPA that can't be fixed with a stint at community college. Apart from attempting to return to my old school, with the issues mentioned above, the only other thing I can think of is going to a local community college with the intent of graduating there. It's not as though I have anything against community college (in fact the local one is quite nice), but it is so frustrating to have my college transcript work against my high school achievements to the point that it feels like my application prospects are worse than if I had never gone to high school at all. I can't even apply with just my high school transcript as a new applicant and start over, as all the schools I checked consider me to be a transfer applicant only.

Hi. 
So I know, high school drop out I must be a complete loser who can't stay committed to anything, I must be extremely lazy, a delinquent. 
Well maybe all stereotypes aren't what people think.  
Through my high school career I was a good student. All of my classes were AP and honors. My future looked bright, everyone had faith that I'd someday make something of myself someday. What could go wrong? 
Well everything was good until the middle of me junior year. 
My dad passed away. My dad was my rock when it came to my schooling, my biggest motivator. So when he passed away I fell into a extremely (and I mean extreme) depression. I stopped going out, barely ate or showered, and most importantly I stopped caring about school. 
Senior year came around I finished my first semester and dropped out of high school in the middle of my 2nd semester. I only had 3 months of school left and I would have walked away with a diploma. 
I realized now what a mistake that was but I know with my mental state i would have failed the classes anyways. 
So here is where I am. I only needed half credits in 2 classes English and a economics class that my school in that state required (I no longer live in that state). 
To graduate you need 22 credits I dropped out with 28 credits. 
What is the best way to receive my needed half credits. 
I want to go to art school and start back in life and make something of myself still.

1214,ShoutingAtToday,1523565171,/r/college/comments/8btex1/seeking_advice_dropped_out_of_college_at_19_im_22/,"So long story short, when I was 19 I made the horrible decision of quitting community college to move 2 hours away from my hometown with my at the time girlfriend who was just starting college. Even reading over what I've just written makes me cringe...

But anyway, fast forward a few years later: I'm 22 and living on my own, working full-time, and making a little under $15/hr. in the aforementioned city I moved to a couple of years ago. I like it here and will be living here at the very least for another year seeing as I am bound to my apartment lease.

Thing is, I realize just how stupid of a decision it was to abandon my education. Don't get me wrong, it's been a good experience living away from home and having to support myself. Eye-opening even. I enjoy my independence, but I definitely want to challenge myself and get an education rather than be bound to my retail job indefinitely. Of course it's partially about money, but I genuinely want to learn and explore academics. Can't stop kicking myself for abandoning and not to mention neglecting that outlet in my life. Truly a lost opportunity. 

What's tough about the whole situation is that being a student as I once was feels so distant to me. I mean yeah of course, cause it's been a few years. But it's a weird feeling. Almost as if I never lived it. And of course most everyone my age that I meet is finishing college. Then again I do live in the heart of a bustling college town. It takes a toll on my self-esteem and I feel less equipped socially and mentally. I definitely feel like it is a crutch now that I'm almost 23. And not to compare myself to everyone else; the sheer fact that I've missed out on and deprived myself of furthering my education is something I view as a personal shortcoming. But I want to forget the past and my horrible decision and go back to school once and for all. I want a quality education. It's just when I was 18/19 I didn't care at all. My parents practically had to drag me to the local community college for a tour, and getting me to apply to college was likely akin to pulling teeth for them. I was such an idiot...

I don't wanna sound like that guy, but honestly I've changed considerably and I feel ready to take this step. But I also feel so lost in trying to figure out what my options are. Like I said, I'm living on my own and working full time, so life is already pretty busy for me. I should mention that I would prefer to try and go for a bachelor's rather than do a 2-year program at a tech school.

I mean, do I move back home with my parents and go to school while perhaps working part-time somewhere instead? It's a tough choice because I do really enjoy the city I currently live in, and I have to be here for another 12 months. Do I try and go to school here? I'm doubtful and feel like applying anywhere would be futile. I mean my GPA in college was not good, and on top of that I am of course a drop out. Not looking for sympathy, these are merely two things causing me to doubt the viability of even going back.

Really didn't intend to ramble on, and apologies for any grammatical errors or confusion. Kinda just pounding away on the keyboard as quickly as I can since I'm at work. But any advice would be greatly appreciated!

1215,f0sters5,1523489981,/r/college/comments/8blqbt/trying_to_get_my_life_together_at_26_and_fear_i/,"Hey guys. This might be a long story so I apologize, and thank you, in advance.

Anyway starting in high school, neither of my parents ever went to school, and neither really believed in it. I was never pushed to do good in school, and never encouraged to pursue higher education. Just before I graduated, the two of them had a very long, drawn out and dramatic divorce. I had just gotten out of a relationship where I had been cheated on. I stopped caring about anything and lost myself in mindless things like video games.

I bounced around from pointless minimum wage job to the next, while also bouncing between parental households as they each kicked me out repeatedly, seeing me as a failure who would never amount to anything. I began to believe they were right.

Eventually I met another girlfriend, and got a decent paying job netting me about 20$ an hour. I was still unhappy, but things felt like they were starting to look up. Until I realized this was just another dead-end job in a warehouse that I was miserable breaking my back at everyday, and even that girlfriend ended up having cheated on me for over a year of our 2 year relationship. I went into a slight depression, stopped working hard at work, and lost that job because of it. Being a dumb 20 year old at the time making that sort of money, I got a credit card thinking it would help build my credit; and it did - until I lost that job and could never pay it back. Now I'm pretty sure my credit is abysmal and I'll never be able to buy a new car let alone a house.

After I lost that job, my mom kicked me out yet again, calling the cops and having them throw me out. I lived in my car in the freezing winter for almost 2 weeks before my dad let me come stay with him again - on the premise I enroll in school, which I did the next week. I was accepted soon thereafter, started working at my dad's business, and started going to school and doing well. I felt like my life was finally going somewhere.

Those first 2 semesters, I held a 3.8 GPA going for a business major. However there were still some things that were getting at me - I had little to no friends, my dad's new wife hated me and made me feel worthless all the time, and because of that my dad told me I was ruining his new marriage, and to top it off I didn't even know what I was going to school for outside of my parents telling me to so that I would simply have a place to live. I started skipping class, which was infectious and go to the point I would only go on test days. My GPA dropped but I was still passing my classes; until in the latter part of my second year, my dad's shop started to do really poorly - he couldn't afford to buy new supplies or things to sell, and he somehow blamed me for it. I was doing the best that I could. I still to this day don't know how he thinks it was my fault. He didn't even pay me to work for him. So thinking that it was my fault his shop closed down, he again kicked me out.

I used a bit of my financial aid loads to move into an apartment on the school campus. But again I became depressed, thinking my whole family hated me, I couldn't get a girlfriend that would ever love me and not cheat on me, that I would never have friends or a good job or even be able to get good grades. I started skipping to the point that I just stopped showing up to class altogether, and needless to say, failed most of them. My last semester there, I stopped going altogether and never went back. I ended with a sub 2.0 GPA and multiple failed classes. I now have about 25k$ in student loan debt without even having a degree to get a job good enough to pay it off with.

During the time I was at school and working for my dad, gave my mom a bit of time to realize I really was trying, and she began to become much more caring. She understood that I was really struggling and once more let me come stay with her. Thankfully she did, because while there I met my now fiance who went to a school nearby there.

Fast forward a few years, and me and her have decent stable jobs in a new town, in a new state. Along the way, I've found an all-encompassing passion for physics and astronomy, and feel for the first time actual drive to finish my schooling. It makes me regret everything I've done along the way besides meeting my fiance, and wish that I could do everything all over, but I can't. And now I sit here, wondering if its even possible to get a PhD in physics and astronomy with all the things I've done wrong compiled into my now life. Thinking that I might not ever to achieve that dream because of my many past failures makes me sometimes want to just end it all.

I don't even know where to begin to finish my studies - I know credible schools won't take me with the grades and attendance record I've gotten, and the community colleges around here either don't have the programs I'm looking for and even if they do, I don't know if they'll even add up to me getting a bachelor's from a reputable school since by next year I'll have 3 years worth of credits amounting to nothing; I have a sum of 2 years of business classes combined with extracurriculars, so would going to community college mean I'm starting all over? Let alone going on for a PhD somewhere even better. Why would anyone ever accept me with my record as a PhD candidate when as of now I'm pretty sure no one reputable would even consider me a BS candidate. Even if it was possible to line everything up perfectly, I wouldn't graduate with my PhD until I was almost 40. That in itself is discouraging enough.

So here I sit, lost, depressed, in debt with no degree and no foreseeable future that I can see lining up for myself because of my past mistakes and failures. I really need advice from anyone who can offer it.

I am currently a freshman and need some advice on my request for a late withdrawal. I am a good student but this January, my dosage for Concerta (a timed-release stimulant similar to Adderall that I take for my narcolepsy) was changed for 36 mg to 54 mg. My appetite was essentially eliminated and I didn't even notice.

From mid-January to late March, I had severe hand tremors, blurred vision, fainting spells, and gigantic gaps in my memory. I did not even notice I wasn't eating due to my memory issues and I assumed everything else was a side effect from my medication. I went to a sleep specialist and she noticed that I dropped to 89 pounds in this period and helped me create a new dietary plan. 

Needless to say, my grades suffered. Two of my classes are essentially screwed. One of them - my science credit - I plan to retake as a part of our Freshman Forgiveness Policy. However, that policy only allows you to retake one class. My other course is an elective.

I am about to submit a request for a Late Withdrawal due to medical reasons. It requires a personal statement (which I have drafted), confirmation by a doctor (my doctor wrote a letter about my weight and side effects from my medication as well as my plan to fix my health, and medical documentation (I am including my MSLT which diagnosed my narcolepsy). But I do have a few questions for strangers on the Internet.

1. Do you think that my request will go through? My boyfriend said yes because it is medically documented and the school could risk litigation if they rejected it but I'm not 100% sure they'll accept my petition.
2. Does your school put a W on the transcript if you withdraw late for medical reasons? My school does not specify on the registrar guidelines and my academic advisor is not sure either.
3. Has anyone else gone through a similar experience? How did it turn out?

I'm super anxious right now and don't want to have a W on a transcript. In my personal statement, I even noted that my first test of the semester was a 19/20 and then it plummeted.

I went to my local community college and dropped out after the 2nd semester with a 2.6 GPA. I had passed 3 classes first semester and dropped my pre calc class. I struggle with depression so it was hard for me to find motivation to study. I ended up dropping out 2nd semester due to finding out about CompTIA certificates and personal issues.

Now my current plan is to get the A+ certificate and just go straight to the IT workforce but I'm also considering going to an out of state university to get a bachelors degree in CompSci. I really do not like it here due to family issues and I'm trying to get out as fast as possible since my depression is worsening. I don't mind being 100k in debt if I'm making 70k+ straight out of college. The only way I'd go back to college is if I prove to myself I can study and finish what has to be done. I've set a couple of hard to achieve goals for myself to finish within 3 months to kind of motivate me and get me ready incase I do decide to enroll.

Do you guys think I can even get in to a decent out of state of college? Or should I just stick to my current plan of getting my certificate and starting out at the bottom of the IT totem pole?

1218,ayylmaos17,1522795348,/r/college/comments/89jjy6/should_i_push_through_calculus_or_drop_altogether/,"So this semester was a semester that was supposed to be easier for me, as although I'm a math/econ double major, I took mostly economics classes with Calculus 3 as my only math course. However, the class has gone significantly worse than expected, and I found out today-the day of the withdraw deadline for classes- that I'm in danger of failing after my last exam. I'm extremely on the fence about what I should do, as the class has taken a large toll on me, and several of my classmates have already dropped the class (a third of the class is failing, yet my professor doesn't see this as an issue). Thus, a large part of me wants to give up altogether and ask for an extension for the withdraw period (I go to a small school, and this is possible). My professor is also extremely unaccomodating, and despite the high rate of failures and withdrawals in the class, she is adamant about not curving the class or any exams at all due to the class somehow remaining a C average (due to outliers). I also have class during her office hours and mandatory sorority events during her study hours, making it extremely difficult for me to receive extra help in the class (if i do choose to push through, i will get a private tutor). 

However, dropping the class comes with its own set of issues as well. As I am going abroad next semester, and am already taking summer math classes to catch up on my major in order to do so, given that I drop the class, I have three options: to not go abroad, not graduate in time, or to switch my major altogether, which are all quite unappealing. But if I do choose to stay in the course, which seems like the riskier but possibly necessary option, what should I do to at least get a C in the course, or is it a better option to drop altogether?

I would say I have worked moderately hard in the class, but due to personal sickness (I've struggled a lot from both physical and mental health this semester), along with family tragedy, my first exams have been pretty rough. I also have a busy courseload at school, work part-time, and am in a sorority, which are all significant time commitments as well. I'm at wits end about what to do if I do choose to stay in the class. My professor is of little to no help, and despite doing all of the necessary work for the class, I grow even more lost. I know that calculus 3 is a HUGE time commitment and I don't even know where to fit the time to study tirelessly, especially since my final is nearly 40% of my grade and again has no curve whatsoever. Any advice would be extremely helpful- I'm so lost about what to do regardless of which option I choose.

I dropped out of school in the ninth grade, 20 years ago, got married to raise my son, and got my GED. Since then I've worked and have never had time to go back, as I worked multiple jobs, got divorced and remarried, and now I've driven a truck for the past 12 years. However, my wife is almost finished with her doctorate and will possibly make enough money to support us and allow me to go to school, which is something I've dreamt of for the last 15 years.

My wife is a lmft, and I love the thought of helping people in that capacity, so I'm thinking to peruse my own degree in mft, but only as far as masters.

However, to cut down on costs, I'll be starting at a community College to get the core stuff out of the way way. For admissions, though, there's the tsi test I'll need to take. I'm not worried about reading/writing, as I'm an agented writer along with the driving gig (ignore the auto corrects) and I aced the practice questions for those, but it's the damn math. Even in high school my math teacher was more interested in my female classmates than he was in teaching.

So, on those notes - Do I stand a chance in going back? I know I'll need remidial classes, but will they look at my grasp of fractions and go ahead and waterboard me? (it's Texas)

TL;DR - I tried to go to a 4 Year State College. 
First semester, 3.8 GPA. 
Second semester, &gt;2.5. 
Third semester, 1.3-- a letter stating that I am in terrible academic standing and that my FASFA has been revoked.

I've been out for almost a full semester and now I want to go back to a community/online college to get a nursing degree. What do I do? 


Long Version: 

I graduated high school in 2016. I was in the top 10% of my class, graduated with high honors, and an overall GPA of around 3.9. I went to college directly after high school and drowned myself in my degree, which was Music Education. 

At this college, it was recommended first-time freshmen take no more than 18 hours a semester for the first two years, and first-time first-generation freshman take no more than 16 hours a semester for the first two years (this was me). 

Due to being a musician, this was overridden for me and I was enrolled into 23 credit hours my first semester--not including 15 required hours of solo practice a week, 3 hours of practice with my instructor, and the 8 hours of marching practice a week that also accompanied a football game every Thursday and every second Saturday or so. The second semester, I was enrolled in 25 credit hours--marching practice now replaced with concert hours, which equaled out to about the same. Then there's the usual college things, such as homework from gen-ed's and attempting to have some sort of social life (my whole time there I made three friends because I just didn't have the emotional strength to add partying/hanging out). 

And I KNOW this may not seem like a lot to some people, but it killed me. I'm a perfectionist and I try to be the best I can be, and I wanted to live up to the standards that were expected of me as a musician. My first semester I was told I was the best freshman the college had seen in years. Then I lost my grip on what mattered, and I just stopped caring. Stopped going, stopped trying, stopped playing. Something in my brain just snapped. I still can't listen to classical music without feeling sick. I tried to switch majors to Gen Psych my third semester there, took all online courses so I could stay away and work at my own pace, but there was a bunch of external things happening at that time and college just wasn't in the books--so, I left halfway through the semester.  

However, this isn't the point. I want to change my life around now and start looking towards something that is better. I want to get my LPN licensure and eventually my RN. But, I'm afraid that I may have ruined my chances. I still have a $10,000 hold on my account at the previous college, plus about $10,000 in debt to the government. I never officially dropped out of my college, but they sent me an exit package just a couple days ago. 

What are my best options? What're my next steps? Do I have to pay off my debts first? Could I possibly write a letter to someone, somewhere, explaining what happened and provide them with my high school transcripts and maybe just have those semesters... removed?

1223,bludarling,1521661343,/r/college/comments/8654gx/cant_stick_to_a_major_to_save_my_life_should_i/,"I initially wanted to be an artist, but started school as a music major, then switched to gen ed, then considered journalism or technical writing, nursing, psychology, then switched to computer science/software engineering, then dropped all my engineering classes and went back to music. I really have no idea what I'm doing. 

 I was super interested in music theory and composition at the beginning of this term, so I thought maybe  I could do some less performance based stuff (my stage fright's a bitch) in the music business, but now I can't seem to even look at my theory homework no matter how hard I try.

I was enrolled in Calculus 1 and Intro to Java, and although the emphasis on creative problem solving and the logic behind computer science fundamentals was really easy for me to absorb, I struggled with the huge workload of calculus. On an impulse fueled by fear, deadlines, and probably sheer laziness, I dropped those classes and stuck to my music stuff, which was going okay until it started to become boring. 

I know, school is not supposed to be fun, and we all have to buckle down and do things we don't want. But, I'm prone to existentialism, and recently I've been thinking about how futile music is. It's literally just vibrations that we somehow enjoy listening to. Plus, it feels like every song has already been written. Boring is probably not the right word to use, it's more like a profound emptiness and uselessness I feel after doing something for a while, which is often accompanied by a nearly manic, obsessive need to learn something else.

That's kind of how I got into computer science. It was a perfect contrast to the intangible aspects of the arts that I don't enjoy, and to top it off, the degree is reputably lucrative.

Becoming massively interested and then suddenly uninterested has been a big struggle for me my whole teen and adult life. I'm immensely under qualified in every possible thing, yet I have a vague understanding of a lot of concepts. This has led me to even consider joining the peace corps, police force or the army, someplace where my future is in someone else's hands where I can become part of something bigger. Realistically, I know I'll resent giving up my individuality just out of mere indecisiveness.

I know this may come off as really off-topic and rant-y, but I really mean to ask for advice and possibly begin a discussion about similar experiences. I guess my problem is that I am so interested in the idea of so many things, but my resilience is so low and I get discouraged very easily. I don't know who I am or where I want to go. I'm sure I have the capacity to learn some sort of discipline, but it's the fear of learning one I hate that holds me back. 

 I don't know what to do, and it embarrasses me to be so back and forth with what I want to do. I've recently thought a lot about dropping out, or even just taking a break, but I know deep down that it's a bad idea. I'm really apathetic about my future, but the only thing that keeps me going is that I don't want to feel dependent on someone in the future, like a spouse or my parents, and I want to travel and see parts of the world that I may never be able to afford on a minimum salary. 

I feel like I have a war between my right and left brain, and I'm not sure if I want a free-spirited, low income, yet spiritually fulfilling lifestyle, or an accomplished, secure, financially independent and respectable one. I'm tired of waiting for my ""life purpose"" to show itself, as people so often say it does. I'm tired of wasting my life, just because my brain is so flaky and undisciplined.

1224,Xenatian,1521184031,/r/college/comments/84tlmp/need_advicehope_im_not_the_only_one/,"Hey y'all. So I'm a sophomore Mechanical Engineering major at a big college, but I'm an out of state student. Which means most of my ""friends"" from high school are back a in-state schools. I ha a rough time socially in high school due to health and because of my health, I didn't smoke or drink, and I think my friends though I would snitch on them if I as around them doing that, so I lost pretty much most of my friends my junior year. Didn't go to parties, everytime I tried to hang out, I get rejected, and all the party kids were my teammates on the baseball team. I also barely played any baseball, the thing I love as much as my family, because of my coach though I hate become weak after I was sick, and didn't think I could play anymore. Long story short, high school sucked. So I was kind of glad I went to an out of state school so I could no longer be around that cancer, started a new life. I was really excited to rush and join a fraternity to be part of the party life, make new friends, and compensate for what I missed out on in high school. At the same time, I was experiment with adding and dropping classes, and dropped a class for my major, Chemistry 1, on accident and couldn't find a time or days I could take it that semester, so I was already behind in my schedule before I even started college. I also didn't get into the fraternity I wanted a dropped, which I regret not being more open minded and just choosing one. To add insult to injury, my roommate facetimed his girlfriend every night, and went home weekends we didn't have home football games. I thought college was, or specifically my college, was going to be easy because its a school in the South, so you know, not much intelligence. I was wrong, and ended up with a 2.6 GPA. I was devastated, and sort of got a wake up call. The only good thing about that semester was my joining a club and finding a community through them. The next semester wasn't any better. My friend wanted me to rush so I could be in his fraternity, and didn't get a bid from them or any other frat, so another semester of no partying, making friends, or girls. I was jealous of all the guys having fun of the frats having fun an I couldn't have that kind of fun as well. Also no fun Spring Break plans. My GPA was a little better, only because I only had two classes to my degree plan, which I ended up having to dropping a class again, Calculus 1, meaning I was now a semester and a half behind in my second semester of college. I just had a bunch of electives to boost my GPA. By May, I was so glad to move out, but I couldn't transfer to my dream school, The University of Texas at Austin, because my GPA was too low. My summer was ok. I tried to take summer classes but that ended up not working out, so I couldn't catch up and that bummed me out so much because I couldn't imagine any of my friends already being behind by the end of their freshman year of college. I moved into an apartment this year, and even though I have friends, I didn't really consider too many of them as close enough friends to be roommates with, and those that I wanted to be my friends already had arrangements. So I had to roommate match, which they've, until recently, have been better than last year's roomate. Rushed again, assuming I was going to be in my friend's frat, because he said I would be a shoe-in, and not only did I not get a bid from them, but none of the other frats here. So another semester of no fun, no friends, and no girls, whereas freshman are getting into frat with no problems because they know people and get to live the life I wanted all 4 years of college. I, at most could, only be in a frat for 2 1/2 years, (probably going to be a 5, maybe 6 year student so maybe 3 or 4 years after all). Classes this semester were fine, but I tripped up on some tests and ended up with a 2.8 GPA by Christmas. The club I was part of started to drive me crazy, but at some point that half the classes I scheduled for this semester go toward a minor in Business Administration, so I thought that was cool, and am now pursuing that. I also realized that it would be easier for me to get an MBA at my from school that a Master in ME from Texas. So now, here I am, having signed a bid to a frat but not being able to do anything  or meet any of my brother's or pledge brothers because of the school's President cancelling then deciding to do Spring Rush, but not having decided when, and because it's halfway through the semester, I'm assuming they won't do it, so 2 years wasting my college time not being in a frat and having a small social life and group of good friends. I did make it a resolution to be more outgoing, which did work, but not to the amount that I wanted, and I haven't really studied or hungout with these people, just good friends in my class. So here we are today, after dropping another class that I need, Physics 1, after I, and everyone else bombed the test Monday, and just signed a lease at another complex without any friends to be my roommates, so doing roommate matching agin, only praying that my future roommates are close to my preference, let alone guys in my fraternity, so I already regret signing it, and not staying at my current complex  in another room or another complex because their closer closer, and a number of other reasons. I'm also upset that I keep dropping classes and wasting my parents money, as well as not progressing a my degree plan and getting closer to graduating. I'm upset that I don't or haven't had any of my friends become my roommates, I'm a pessimist and depressed because I always think that nothing will work-out for me since nothing has since my junior year of high school. I know that I'm depressed, everyone does, but I refuse to see a therapist because I know that I'm too stubborn and pessimistic to listen to their advice because I don't possible see how it'll improve my life. I don't go out to the bars on the weekends because I don't really have friends to go with. I tried going by myself a few times because of my resolution, and it's intimidating going by yourself, especially if you don't have a fake, because, for me, it's easier to talk to people, especially girls when I'm buzzed. Also bars quickly get expensive, are loud, and without being in a frat, I can't drink, so I stay in on the weekends, which upsets my parents. They want me to be more social. I know my priorities are out of whack, and I wish I could change that, but the party scene is so big at my school, that it's hard to not think about it. I could motivate myself with the money from my future career, which ironically, I know what to do, Reservoir Engineer, but it hasn't. I also want to get into McCombs School of Business at Texas to ge my MBA so it makes it easier to go up my future company's chain of command, which is hopefully Shell, ExxonMobil, or other big name oil companies, but for those companies I need at least a 3.2 GPA, and to get into McCombs, a 3.4. I'm also afraid about life after graduating because it seems so monogamous, waking up, go to work, go home, eat, sleep. I've heard that the social party life gets better after college because now you have money to do what I want, but I find that hard to believe because I'm no longer around college girls, and there aren't frat parties to go to anymore, only bars, an even that, to me, starts to look monogamous. That my pessimism showing again. I've heard to slowly become an optimist, I should write down at least 3 good things that happened everyday, but I can't even think of three things.I just want to hear what yall have to say, but typically when I post stuff, I get negative comment from people which is extremely unhelpful, so just advice or, hopeful stories that hopefully I'm not the only one facing these struggles.

Edit:Most of my friends are in Greek Life, and seeing everything that they're doing on Snapchat and Instagram makes me feel bad because I know that also should be me, but it isn't me, and it gets me really sad that I'm not spending my time in college like that. Another thing I worry/get upset about is that freshman, who are taking Calculus 2, Chemistry 2, and Physics 1, are making these classes look easy, or aren't struggling nearly as hard as I am in classes that I'm currently in, and it urks me how they get it and get better grades, and I don't. Another thing is for most engineering students, it takes 5 years on average to graduate, but I feel like it'll take me 5 1/2-6 years to graduate, whereas my other friends, college or high school friends, even those who are also engineering majors, will have already graduated and have a job, while I'll still be in school, making me feel like an idiot compared to them. Now I've heard you shouldn't worry about what others are doing or thinking about you, only worry about you and yourself, but for me, its a lot easier said than done because I want to impress and outdo other

I was lucky to have a pell grant and a bright futures scholarship (i’m from FL) so I didn’t have to pay for school which was extremely helpful as my family isn’t very well off. Long story short, my loss of motivation led to me overall just skipping class and eventually dropping out. My parents were furious, and said that the only option I have left is the army. I’m well into the recruiting process and am pretty close to signing my contract but i’m having second thoughts. Is it really my last option? If anyone was a college dropout and went back, how did you get back into school? I would like to go back to a community college and get back at my degree but my parents seem to think I won’t even get into any community colleges, and if I did my grant and scholarships won’t work bc my dropout made me ineligible. If I were to apply to any community colleges, would my HS academic career help now or just my college?

Now Im going back to school (about 5 weeks in) and its getting depressing/overwhelming again. I get the feeling no one really understands what im talking about. 

Anyone feel like this? Should I drop out again?

Edit: I should also mention that ive been feeling like this for 7ish years. The only times when im happy are when im not in school. Also let me try to explain it like this....... 

So doing assignments are extremely draining on me, it feels like torture. Not in a ""Im brain dead from studying"" way, more off a ""I want to die because feeling nothing at all is preferable to what im feeling like"". Some times I can tolerate that feeling, sometimes I cant. But regardless its always there and always as strong, im just tolerating it. Then the teacher will say something like ""Ok, your assignment needs a bit more work"" or ""Ok class, I need you to read an extra chapter this week"" and it seems everyone (except me) is fine with this. But like I said, its torturous to me. And it seems like no one gets where im coming from, its always ""So, just add 2 more sources. Whats the big deal?"" or ""Just read the chapter"". 

Ive tried to talk to people about this but they say ""Go ask someone else"", so I asked someone else and they said ""Go ask someone else"" (I think you can tell where this is going). But in the end it dosnt matter who I talk to because I still have to do the assignments and the feeling is still there. But thats not exactly the truth, I dont *have* to do the assignments, I could drop out and the feeling will go away.

I'm a 24 year old (turning 25) college student looking for some advice. I got accepted into college at 18. 

A short little backstory:
I abused and was addicted to a couple of different prescription medications during my early years in college. I somehow managed to go to school/class while being high off these prescription drugs (I lived on campus). I wasn't high 24/7 but was frequently taking medication recreationally.

I got into a big car accident and it changed my life. I took a leave of absence from school for two years, left the country, and recently came back. 
I deeply regret the decisions that I made but now I've got to live with them. I've made peace with my demons and have salvaged a majority of the relationships I destroyed. 

On the bright side, 
I’ve come back to the states with a new found motivation in life and wanted to continue my education at my college! The thing is... my overall GPA is horrific and I've been on ""early academic warning"" since the end of my 2nd year of college (low gpa warning). You can only imagine the amount of studying I was getting done with the amount of partying I was doing. I'm not proud of it. 

I only have a couple more units to take to graduate..but school is harder than ever. I find myself struggling and having a difficult time understanding some of the material. I honestly don't know how I made it this far and am quite surprised I hadn't dropped out of school while I was taking all those drugs. 
I'm in a sticky situation now. I'm struggling in my courses right now and have no margin for error left. I have very little leeway when it comes to failing another course... I'm honestly even too scared/nervous to talk to advisor about this. 

Can I salvage anything? Am I just wasting my time? Should I just drop out? Can I ever go back to school even with my horrific transcript? 
Please help me sort things out in my head. I feel like I've got to make a decision very soon as my tuition is due early next week...",college,Trying to fix damage done from the past,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/80gx8z/trying_to_fix_damage_done_from_the_past/,1519700286.0

1232,KickzNGigglez,1518515687,/r/college/comments/7x8dsd/got_accepted_to_my_university_of_choice_but_may/,"I'm not going to lie, I was a pretty terrible student when I first entered college. My best friend and the person I loved most in the world died because of a drunk driver and I didn't know how to handle it. When my parents heard, they essentially told me ""you're a man, stop crying and get over it"". I was full of hate for the world and ended up failing through 6 terms and leaving with a 0.6 GPA. At this point I spent the next 2 years as a shut in, rarely leaving my room.

Eventually I forgave my parents, the unfair world, and learned to live with the pain. I decided I was more angry that I had lost a significant portion of my life grieving. I got a job, worked on the social anxiety that developed from isolation, and went back to college. The job was more than enough to get me through school, I was opening up more, and my grades never dropped below a B since returning. I eventually received my acceptance into a University and I finally felt like my efforts were paying off. I simply had to make sure I passed 2 Economic courses.

That's however where my problem started. I woke up this morning doing my homework online per usual. It was all great and dandy until I submitted my work and it said I had no permission to do so and I couldn't find my course on canvas. I came to the quick conclusion that I had just been dropped from my class.

I checked eservices to check if my payments somehow got rejected. I saw a transaction where I was charged on the 11th and refunded on the 12th. I assumed this was why I was dropped and probably a result of a glitch as I remember paying on new years. I was annoyed, but sure that I could resolve it easily by showing my payment history.

The cashier's office eventually emailed me back telling me that I got dropped as a result of my professor claiming I no showed. I was so confused as I had been attending every class and had done every assignment. I of course emailed my professor on the matter politely.

The response however was quite rude. It could be summed up as ""I dropped you because you haven't signed up for the software and turned in your work. You'd know this if you responded to your school email. Get a form filled out by the admins office and maybe I'll consider reinstating you"". 

The thing is, I had been going through my Emails. There was never an Email requesting a response. All the emails were deadline notices. Ironically I even received confirmation on my school email every time I submitted an assignment. I was convinced this was a case of mistaken identity and I swiftly responded with my case. I even offered to forward the confirmation of my assignment submissions.

However, its been 8 hours since my retort. I tried to assure myself that everything would be resolved once my professor looked into it. Alas the paranoia settled in. The thought ""What if he got offended and decides to leave me dropped out of sheer pettiness?"" kept running across my mind. I was scared and unsure. For the first time I couldn't fight my way out, I was at the mercy of time. So many emotions ran through me the past few hours. I was obviously worried, but also extremely angry. I spent the past few years fighting and clawing myself out of a hole and this man ruins me, assuming I'm just another unmotivated teen. 

After 8 hours of emotional rollarcoastering during work I feel just exhausted now. I'm not sure how I'm going to confront this professor calmly about the issue on Wednesday. I don't know what to expect about the assignments I'm missing because I no longer have access to the work. That is of course assuming I'll even be reinstated.

1235,TheKandyCinema,1518402485,/r/college/comments/7wxm00/bachelor_of_science_vs_arts_for_psychology/,"So I'm currently in High School right now and I'm going to have to take a Science course this summer because I'll need another science to get into the next Spring program I want to get into, which would be Psychology. I feel it's one of the most versatile and flexible degrees that could open a lot of doors, and I'm extremely passionate about it as well. So I'm trying to get as much information as possible to make my decision on which Science/Psychology course to take.

But right now, I'm looking and I can either work towards a Bachelor of Science or a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology. The costs are nearly the same too. 

For Science, this summer I would need to take a Physics or Chemistry course at the Grade 12 level if I wanted to get in, but I am fucking awful at both of these sciences (I've tried, but I dropped out my Physics Grade 12 class this year with a 36%, and Chemistry is even worse than that. No amount of studying can change how terrible I am at these two concepts). And if I somehow were to pass, it would drop my average significantly. My average right now is competitive for the Faculty of Science at a mid 80.

For Arts, I would need to take a General Sciences course at the Grade 12 level, which many people (including teachers of the course) say it is comparable to a Grade 11 course in terms of difficulty. I already passed Grade 12 Biology with an 85% and I feel this knowledge would help me out significantly, and I could probably get over a 90% in the course. I'm over the competitive mark for Faculty of Arts as well.

So I have a couple questions.

What's the difference between the two when it comes to my future? Is one better by a significant margin or are they both looked at relatively the same by employers? 

If I wanted to get a job out of post-secondary with my Bachelor's, which would leave me with more options?

All I ever feel anymore is either anger, crushing anxiety, or sadness. I feel completely trapped. I've heard so many stories of people I went to school with (and know some of them personally) who couldn't cut it in college because of their emotional issues, so they dropped out and now spend their days working a menial job and pissing away their precious time.

I have totally good reasons for wanting to drop, such as it will actually be cheaper to take the same course at OSU for example.  I suppose what I'm trying to get at is that for whatever reason, I'm actually really hesitant to drop this class.

Any of you ever experience this?  Is it a sort of academic pride or something?  It's almost like a sense of guilt or shame.

EDIT: I think is should have mentioned this before, but I've been in school since 2015.  I still haven't earned my associates degree, mostly because I've changed my majors quite a bit, so maybe it's the slow progress or something?",college,Seeking some insight,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7scg6r/seeking_some_insight/,1516705850.0
1244,StabilizedDarkkyo,1516679448,/r/college/comments/7sbp4z/is_there_still_hope_for_me_to_attend_college_long/,"I have attended three semesters of college as a degree-seeking student. I didn't fuss about it, but near the end of the semester, my family got an eviction notice that freaked me out like crazy, as my step-dad wasn't paying rent and was misusing our money. I was already struggling as these last few years of my life have been insane, but we were able to survive. Around that time my Mom and step-dad started their separation/divorce. It left me frazzled at the end of the semester, and I ended up getting an A, C, and D. Not terrible, but I got an academic warning. I told myself it was just me being lazy, and that the next semester I would do better.

Then, spring semester of 2017 came and life got insane again, even more so this time. My grandfather committed suicide by shooting himself in the face during spring break, my step-father attempted suicide multiple times from the beginning to end of the semester, my brother got put into inpatient treatment for suicidal activity, and we realized how screwed over we were financially from my stepdad's misuse of our money. Things became tight financially, so I continued my student job I started the first semester of school, but I noticed my performance had dropped significantly from the previous semester, both in school and work. I got an academic probation, seeing that my GPA dropped under a 2.0 to a 1.66. But I was able to get an airline ticket as a prize in a lottery at work, so I thought I'd be able to relax by seeing my father and his side of the family down in Michigan. Heck, the next semester would be great if I came back relaxed! So I booked a trip right before the fall semester started.

During summer, my stepfather overdosed on Ambien twice, strangled himself with a belt to passing out and tried suffocating himself with a bag. Finally, he was told to move out after he was hospitalized. This constant calling of 911 and being afraid there would be a dead body in our house kept everybody in the house on edge. Everybody was stressed, anxious, and terrified. Thankfully I was able to stay at another house for a couple days here and there when I needed to, but the stress still got to me. Then, during the trip to see my father, it turned out that he wasn't what we thought he was. I had brought my brother with me, and two days before we left, my father started verbally assaulting my brother over how he'd die if he were ever to be robbed, how my mother raised him wrong, how he would have raised us to be good christian children, how he wanted to take my little brother and force him to stay there. My father mocked him for having an online girlfriend, telling him he should be screwing every girl possible, told him that he was a pussy that needed to learn how to kill, and so forth. I hid in a room trying to stay away from the fight, but my stepmom dragged me out and started screaming at me at how i had told my mom that she was abusing my little brother, how I was totally conspiring against her when I was only 11. We later went to go on a boat ride, but on the way my step father screamed at us for being non-religious, that he was ashamed of us bieng his blood, that I was a pussy-footing failure, that neither of us woudl get anywhere in life, and finally that we better not tell our mother, as telling our mother would get him pissed off, and he told us that everybody that pisses him off would no longer exist on earth. So basically he threatened to kill us. So on the boat, my little brother called my mom while I kept a look out, and the next day our relatives in the town kept us away from our father as much as they could without raising suspicion. Then, past security at the airport we met up with my mother, where our father couldn't see, and went home. We were scarred from that, and we went to school full of stress and fright. I went to the counseling center at the university after breaking down when trying to tell my teacher what was wrong with me, but they said I was a bit too extreme to me and referred me to the psychological counseling center, who didn't accept me as I wasn't suicidal. So, I went to my former childhood therapist. My brother ended up dropping out. I got academically disqualified. 

I for some odd reason thought there was still hope that I could go to school this semester, but I wasn't able to. Turned out they removed me from the degree program, so I tried as a non-degree seeking student. Turns out that as a non-degree seeking student, I had no access to any of the loans or student aid I heavily relied upon, as my family has been spending pretty much every cent on the financial mess we were left in. I called the financial aid center and tried to see what I could do, and they said my only option was to go to class and pay out of pocket or go get a SAP appeal done. So, I emailed my academic counselor about it. This morning I got an email saying that I was pretty much removed from the university. The SAP appeal was only allowed for degree-seeking students, but seeing as how I became non-degree seeking a few days prior, I was disqualified from that. 

I have no financial way to go to college without begging for money from my father or getting a job, which would interfere with university especially since I can't even drive yet. So, I'll have to take the next semester or two off to raise up money to go to college, but my loans only give me a grace period of six months, so I am afraid I won't have enough money to go to classes before that is up. Is there anything I can do to still go to college, or do I have to just drop out for the semester and work until I can afford it again?

1246,AppleWare,1516418586,/r/college/comments/7rnv5s/my_first_week_transfer_student_struggles/,"So I applied to a school that I did not like. I wanted to go far away from the city (I don’t like the busyness of it), but I ended up in the middle of it. My ideal place was some school that is rural.

I chose to go to this school for these reasons:

1. Cheap compared to my other options. 

2. Friend was going to go here, but got extended in the army

I graduated from CC fall 2017, and did not know my next step. My plan if I went here went down hill. I hate commuting to the city, but I thought I might like it more if I lived on campus. Well my grants and loans only covered my tuition. I have not even bought books yet, so I threw my plans of dorming out the window.

Here are my problems:

1. I am just so stressed. Idk anyone in my classes, and I feel like I am alone. I want to meet new people, but I can’t cause of the train schedule. Most clubs start between 2pm-5pm. I just can’t stay that long because my dad picks me up from the train after work. Staying late would not be fair. Also, most homeworks are due by 6pm, so I can’t stay late.

2. The mental stress of commuting is killing me. I wake up so early. 5:30am is not a time I want to be awake. This is another reason why I don’t want to stay on campus for a long time (I need some sleep). I feel like from the time I wake up I’m tied down to a schedule. My class ends at a very inconvenient time for the train, so I end up running to the bus to get home on time.

3. All 3 of my profs want me to go to office hours for good grades. I just can’t stay that late, and they are so stuck up about it too. They don’t like email, and they said they would only suggest an appointment so dont even think about it. They even claim that only 7% of the class gets an A, and those are the one’s who go to office hours.

Idk I’m not even sure if all of this stress is worth it. I sometimes just want to go back to CC and get a certificate in something.

I talked to my dad about it, and he says we are not fortunate enough to rent me a dorm. Which I completely understand. I feel terrible enough of him saving to buy my books/pay for my train ticket (which is $250 monthly).

I can’t even remember the last time I had a good night of sleep. The only thing helping is the benadryl that I take, or else I’d be up at night worrying about this.

I applied for some scholarships they added. It’s only for next semester though, so no saving grace coming anytime soon.

TL;DR: Don’t like school’s city setting, too broke to dorm, to tired to function, no friends, hard to make friends, and basically stressed.

1247,Pepperman94,1516307618,/r/college/comments/7rcpd8/i_have_a_low_gpa_at_community_college_but_it/,"My backstory: In high school, I was a very good student. In a class of 400+ students I was 2nd place. Could have been first too, but that's water under the bridge. I had a ton of AP classes, most with 5s and the occassional 4. I got a perfect on the math portion of the SAT and near perfects on the Reading and Writing Portions, as well as very good scores on the History and Calculus subject SATs. The school I got into was Carnegie Mellon, but unfortunately the difficulty of the classes freaked me out so much that I dropped out after half a semester. I wasn't used to being challenged, and I regret not sticking it out but at the time it was super stressful and I wasn't sure I would make it. CMU was nice about it too, they erased my transcript so there's no record of me ever going there.

After bombing out of CMU, I immediately wanted to go to my second choice school (out of the ones I got into at least): UVA. But my mom made me take a semester at community college. ""Just for practice"" as she put it. Well we found out later that you can't just take one semester at community college and apply freshman to another school. You have to stick it out until you have 30 plus credits then go in as a transfer student. I didn't know this, and if I did I wouldn't have failed every single course I was forced to take at community college. I had to spend several years digging myself out of the hole I put myself in, slowly raising my GPA from a 0.00 to the 2.38 that it is now. The thing is though, if I get As in the two courses I'm taking now, my GPA could rise as high as a 3.74, which is far more than the 2.85 required to go to George Mason. Even if I get Cs my GPA will still be above the requirement. I'm confident I could do it, I got all As my last two semesters, and I want to move out of my mom's house as soon as possible because I'm going crazy living at home. I don't want to wait another year if my GPA will be high enough to apply by the end of this semester. For the record I've taken 19 credits at community college but I have 45 AP credits. It wouldn't be guaranteed admission, but I do feel that because of my stellar high school performance I can make it at a school like GMU.

I emailed George Mason about this and they basically said, very nicely I might add, ""you can try but we may reject you""

I'm almost 24 by the way. I realize a lot of this is banking on how well I did in high school and how much I've improved over the years at community college rather than just the GPA statistic. Should I contact my high school to get them to send my transcript to GMU? It's also important to note I did not attend college every semester for the past 6 years, which will be difficult to explain, since I wasn't working during those years.

Everyone told me I was crazy for wanting to transfer, but I was so miserable that after a year I said goodbye to that place. I dreamed of attending a large catholic uni in CA, and was estastic that I was accepted. However, acceptance came with the price of paying tuition that would put my family in probably our worst financial situation ever, and I would graduate with 40k in loans for a film degree. My parents kindly allowed me to go through with this.

I spent the past week and a half attending classes, orientation, and enjoying the catholic environment and CA weather. I was happy, so happy, and felt like I was finally at a place where I belonged.

So, I've always suffered with anxiety and depression, mainly due to family issues and dropped out of my A-levels due to anxiety and depression but took them the next year independently (I found the materials online, enrolled as a private candidate at a school and paid the money). 

Luckily I'm a really good student having got 6A*s and 4 As at GCSE and I managed to get AAB independantly in my A-levels.

I applied for uni and for the first 4 months it was heaven. I loved my course, was a natural and the people on it were amazing. But I lost my mum to a long, terminal illness and the abuse by my dad escalated during the Christmas break. My dad had always been abusive, but after my mum passed he got worse and worse and I was facing a lot of family pressure to stay living with him (because we'd just lost mum). 

Although my university experience was incredibly positive, I got high grades (all high firsts, one at 82% and one even 85% which is publishable standard) and loved my course mates, however, I was riddled with anxiety due to my personal situation. When I left for the summer my mental health took a bad turn and I became paranoid about my major choice.

I decided to change my major, even though I was really enjoying my course because I was so riddled with anxiety that my major wasn’t practical enough that I wouldn’t find a graduate job with it upon graduation and be able to leave my dad for good. (I had been abused by my dad and never wanted to have to live with him again.)

It wasn't an easy choice because it would mean me having to start again from scratch and I was so happy on that course and I only really made a firm decision at the very end of the summer after having weighed up and debated everything countless times.

I now think that me changing my major was looking for ways to control my life because I felt so out of control in my personal life. It was a really, really bad decision.

Looking back, I definitely should have kept with my course. It was a consequence of my very poor mental health and lack of academic guidance, plus the administrators just dealt with the issue quickly and simply upon me suggesting it (they just facilitated the course change without asking any questions). 

I went from being probably the most able and popular student on my first course to being pretty much bullied in this one (which I never thought would be possible at university level). The first course was mixed gendered, but this one is all girls (perhaps adding to the bitchy atmosphere?) and I'm not a natural in the subject to say the least. All in all it was a horrendous decision and I am performing terribly in my new course (in addition to being excluded by the classmates, I'm not enjoying the subject and I didn’t do anything related to it high school, and despite getting extra tuition from the course tutor/assistants), I don’t understand a lot of the material and only chose it because I wanted to make sure I'd find quick graduate employment and would never have to rely on my dad.

The main professor herself states that the class is a “weird group” in the sense that 90% of them are taking a double-major with another subject (that I am not taking) and they tend to exclude the students that are not on this double-major (it’s not me being anti-social - the professor has even noticed this and told students in other groups (some of which I'm friends with) about it) and so I have no friends on the course and nobody to ask for extra help.
This spell of bad luck sounds too bad to be true or like I'm making it up, but unfortunately for me it isn't.

I am pretty much failing at the moment, after all that I've been through in my family situation, my mental health and even sitting my A-levels completely alone. 

The whole thing has made me contemplate suicide, but then I realised it would be better to give up uni altogether than do that - even though I'd be giving up my potential.

I know it’s unconventional, but I would give ANYTHING to go back to my old course and I know it’s so unlikely that I would be able to, given that I would have to skip a semester, but I would literally do ANYTHING and I mean ANYTHING.

The head of the department was adamant at the start of term (week 4) that it was already too late...

My only possibility would be to ask them if I could try to sit the exams for this semester as well as my previous course during the current exams period (which, having been a natural at my old course and very motivated to study independently I'm sure I could do).

I have felt suicidal over this and can’t forgive myself from leaving such an amazing life situation for such a terrible one.

Would anyone know of ANY circumstances that I’d be able to get them to let me skip this semester and re-join that course on the grounds of personal circumstances, if I agreed say, to take the exams and submit the coursework off my own back? I do have doctors and counselors to back me up as to my personal situation.

My final options in persuading them are:

1. Threatening to leave completely (which isn't a bluff, I'm so unhappy there that I really would rather leave)

- This would only really work if they're more bothered about losing students than about making exceptions for course changes which I guess would set a bad precedent. I'm not too sure how bothered the academic admin are - they're losing out on fees I guess and I had 2 essays graded at over 80% (publishable standard) in just my first year.

OR

2. Getting my counselor involved. She is the only support system I have and quite a forceful character, I know she would be quite stubborn and persistent with them in outlining my situation and my need to be on a course that I'm happy in.

So far I've been there for a year (I transferred in) and I'm considered to be a senior on campus. Last semester (Fall 2017) I was discouraged from taking out the Sallie Mae loan by my father (since its a high interest loan) and told to apply for a federal loan from Canada and that I could pay off the rest of the money in installments since the Canadian loan would only cover half my tuition. I had explained this to my advisor who said that that would be fine. So I go through the semester applying for my federal loan and trying to contact my advisor for when it would be the best time to enroll in a payment plan and I can't reach her all semester. Near the end (like a week before the semester ends) she tells me I can't enroll in a payment plan because I'm an international student and by their policy I'm not allowed to pay in installments. She literally demanded that I pay the remaining tuition around 7K in full. Neither my parents, husband, nor myself have that kind of money laying around. She also told me that she could have worked out a payment plan for me if I had come earlier in the semester (which I had tried doing, I was completely upfront with her about my situation) I was forced to apply for the Sallie Mae loan and my advisor told me that once it was approved I would be re-instated for classes for the upcoming Winter semester (since they were dropped due to the fact that I had a 7k balance). 

However after the loan was approved my advisor was MIA again and the classes were not re-instated. I caught up with her after New Years on Jan 3rd and she basically told me she couldn't put me into new classes unless if I signed up for a payment plan or paid Winter semester's tuition in full. I asked her how to apply for the payment plan and then she got all weird and wen't ""how much can you afford for a down payment"". It was all super sketchy and there was no paper trail of any kind regarding this ""payment plan"". I walked out of her office and applied for Sallie Mae again for the Winter semester. The next day my advisor was MIA again so I had to contact her manager who removed the tuition hold off of my account but said it was too late in the semester to register for classes by myself and that my advisor had to do it. 

 I told the manager which classes I required and she said she forwarded the information to my advisor and that she would get it done. I emailed the advisor for confirmation and received an automated message that she was gone. Her manager then told me that she would be working on my issue from home. 3 days have passed and my classes have not been re-instated. I emailed the manager like 50 times and all I got was ""she is working on it"" or ""she can get you scheduled"". No body is telling me where my advisor is in the scheduling process. No body is telling me when or if these classes can get scheduled. It's Saturday night right now and school starts on Monday. I have no idea what to do.

I have a huge range of subjects that I love and have a knack for, but only limited knowledge of all of them because I have no focus. History, astronomy, physics, politics, philosophy, anthropology, and a bunch of other stuff. Concepts I grasp and can discuss at length, but could never do anything useful with them. I have a lot of talents and not many skills.   
Besides all of that stuff, I think I would want to get a degree in computer science with a minor in philosophy. The end goal being a job developing AI, something I currently have 0 experience in. I've never done any kind of programming or anything, but besides a teaching job it's the only thing I can think of that I would be able to do in the future. Mainly because of how prevalent it'll be in 8-10 years, and farther down the line. Considering quantum computing is becoming easier and more stable, that'll also probably be something I would want to have an understanding of. Does that mean I would need to fit quantum physics in their somewhere?   
Anyways. I want to go to school, and I have a tentative plan of CS and Philosophy. Now what? I've gone to community college 3 times now and dropped out at the end of every semester due to emotional problems. I have almost 0 understanding of how college works in America. It seems like a giant unconquerable beast. How many classes would I need? In what? Where? How do you choose a university? Do you do public schooling first? How do you know if credits carry over? Is there a way to minimize lost time if you switch majors? Where's the sweet spot between quality of degree and price of attending? How do I get grants and scholarships? I have applied for FAFSA before, but the amount of money I received didn't go very far. No one I know has any money, so it would all have to be through scholarships and loans.  
I'm the kind of person who is unable to act without a solid plan. Everyone I know who went to college just sort of ""jumped in"", but I'm completely incapable of that. I need a goal and a piece of paper with that details exactly how, when, and where I'm going to pursue it. Then I can happily devote myself to 4+ years of living, eating, and breathing school.

i f***d it up- 2013 freshman in civil engineering(Which i'm forced into)- didn't make it-&gt; had to do my freshman year again- finally dropped out of college in 2015

since then, I started learning about computers and tech which was my fav since childhood but never got to learn and spent 3 years learning everything unofficially without a single certificate. 

So after 5 years(2 years of failed graduation + 3 years of missing record about the events i did), I'm planning for college during Fall 2018 in US.

As an International student, I have 2 options ahead of me-

1. Go to community college, work hard for GPA to prove good university that i'm still motivated in my genuinely interested field and finally get transferred after 2 years.

2. Write ACT/SAT- apply to mediocre(i know there's no chance for ivy league though my high school grades are very good) universities and start my freshman directly in them but i seriously doubt if any University would be interested in looking at my application after a failed graduation attempt coupled with 5 years of gap.

1263,americanbadger3,1512942707,/r/college/comments/7ix3xx/failure_in_college_isnt_the_end/,"So I hope by posting this, people who are feeling discouraged this week and next week throughout finals can give people struggling some hope. 

Throughout elementary/middle school/high school, with few exceptions, I was a straight A's student. I lettered in academics, mathematics, Spanish, and art, received four honors cords upon graduation, and was accepted into every college I applied to.

When I went to college it was a different story. 

I was double majoring in Psychology and Mathematics, was an active participant in the learning community, and ended my first semester with C's in most of my classes, and failed one of them. My parents chewed me out that I hadn't tried hard enough, and they were right, in part. And part of it was just that I hated class and hated getting up and walking to 8ams on the other side of class. 

So I went back for another semester. 

And came back with more or less the same grades. 

I worked during the summer and took a Calc I course at the local community college to get myself ahead from where I was behind in the math department, and learned how much I absolutely hated calculus. 

I went back to school in the fall and took Calc II, and took the required Stats class for Mathematics, and learned that I actually liked statistics, so later in the semester, after I failed Calc II, I switched to double majoring in Psychology and Statistics, and signed up to take Calc II again. I got elected as an officer of my school's Stat Alliance, and led projects in statistics consultation work. 

Then, I failed the intro Statistics class and Calc II. 

I called my mom up, crying, and told her that I was struggling so much in the things I liked, and she told me that she and my dad had talked and thought I should switch majors, and they had one picked out for me if I was willing to listen to what they thought I would be good in. 

With their recommendation, I went to my university's college of liberal arts counsellor and dropped both my majors in favor of a Communications major and Poli Communications minor. 

Doing so, I was terrified I would be adding years onto my degree, and I was afraid I wouldn't be able to make it to the end. 

As it turns out, not only can I graduate on time with all the electives I had taken, but it's even possible for me to graduate a semester early if I pushed for it. 

I've been in the degree less than a year, but by the end of this week, I will have finished and passed (some with flying colors!) all of the required introduction courses of the major and will be allowed to take any courses that interest me in the department. I'm looking at graduating as early as next December. 

Throughout this entire struggle, I was elected into the position of president of my campus residence hall's student body government, and was able to write most of my papers for my classes about the organization, and received more academic support from my advisors then I ever received from tutors and professors and counsellors. I'm now looking at running for a position on the regional board, but I know even now that my grades might restrict me from doing so. 

And yet, I've never been prouder of the work I put in this semester. I still don't have perfect grades, and there were a lot of assignments I straight up forgot to turn in that could have turned a C into a B, but compared to where I was last year, I'm a different person and I've grown a great deal. Last year I wondered if it was even worth it to finish school and if I should just start working full time at the local coffee place.  Now, I'm excited to finally reach graduation in 2018 or 2019, and actually start a career in something, anything. 

I have career aspirations, and realistically it may take years for me to begin achieving some of them due to academic history. But they aren't completely out of my reach just yet. 

I've got a lot of work I need to put in, but despite all of my failures, I still have a future in front of me. It's just changed a lot over the years.

I just didn't care after my sophomore year and was sick of waking up at 5am and failing tests and forgetting homework and teachers. Really I was just lazy, but high school wasn't for me.  When I was a junior in high school I started working at a restaurant where I was making quite a bit of money as a busser.  When I turned 18 my senior year I got promoted to be a barback where I started making serious dosh, as well as continued working as a busser on weekdays.  It was getting tough to balance work and school life and with how much money I was making I thought I didn't need school and dropped out and immediately got my GED. Dropping out was the worst decision I've ever made, but at the same time I think it was the best decision at the time.

I worked in that restaurant for 2 more years before I got sick of working every single day for very very long hours.  Having had money saved up I put in my two weeks after just being sick of it. The money was good but it was just too stressful.  I called my parents and asked if I could move in with them and go to community college.  They said yes and a month later I moved in

My first semester was a big learning curve.  I adapted pretty quickly thanks to the people I sat next too helping me out.  Before you know it I was taking notes and being engaged in class every single day.  I passed all my midterms, finals, was turning in all my homework.  Classes actually became fun and I enjoyed them.  I finished my first semester with 2 B's and a C.  

Then this semester came along and I took 3 more classes (Java 1, Intro to Networking, Principles of Management)

    Painting the picture..

Single male, 30 years old. Living in central Arkansas. No kids. **No debt**. I went to college when I was 18 years old after being in the top echelon &amp; AP classes in all of my junior through high school years and went to college for 2 years, but only got credit for 1 year of classes cause I withdrew or failed the others. I was always the shy kid growing up and had only a couple of friends. Never went to a party, never dated, nothing. College gets here and I have my first drink. I move in with now 4 friends in a 2 bedroom apartment on campus. I GM a chain of video game stores and rack up a good 50 hours a week, while taking 12 hours of classes. Long story short, something had to break and I never had a direction in school. I was going to do Film, but the school didn't offer that program yet. Admittedly, I just went to college cause I was a dumb 18 year old and we are all sent to college with the idea of ""Figure It Out"". Thankfully, instead of spending more thousands of dollars on a degree that I'm not quite sure would have financially got me anywhere, I dropped out. But, that was after passing all of my classes the last semester to get myself out of academic probation. So, left in good standing.

-
Spent the next few years going from job to job after the owner of the video game franchise fucked up his personal finances with his 8 businesses and had to declare bankruptcy. I paid off the $15,000 I owed the university for my fucking shit up. Found a fantastic bartending position at 24 years old. Started making around $40k a year. Which is a ton for a single, bachelor guy without any responsibilities and in a very low cost of living state. So, kind of partied for the rest of my 20's and went on vacations. Saw a ton of shows, went to Bonnaroo 11 times (couple of times as a teenager), traveled, did cool shit. Had a good time.

    Now..

I'm 30. Don't want to bartend the rest of my life FOR SURE. Hate working until 3AM. I hate most of the 21 year olds that come in the bar. There's no career path with this job, I've been at the glass ceiling for 5 years now and I DEFINITELY don't want to manage. And one day I want to start a family. Also, I'm overrrr the party life. I hardly touch drinking. I went almost a year without drinking recently (damn 30th birthdays). I'm just ready to be..... a 30 year old, I suppose.

* Time to get shit done, son.

So, I enrolled back at my old university. Pretty big school. They accepted me back immediately. I was looking at Computer Science initially after a frustrating 6 month span of redditing and talking to people and pulling all of my hair out. I was enjoying some courses on Team Treehouse. But, I ended up talking to some very like minded friends who urged me to do MIS (Management Information Systems) instead. Same job path, same career trajectory, same pay (perhaps a little lower ceiling on pay, but I don't need to make $200k a year), but wayyy more people skills involved (which I excel at) and business classes instead of advanced math classes in the course. Still learn programming. My buddy's company literally just hired 2 guys for the same job. One was CS. One was MIS. Same job. Same pay.
-
MIS &amp; CS opportunities are growing substantially in Arkansas. If you're not from Arkansas, you probably think this place is redneck and backwoods. But, if you grew up here, you know it's an amazing place with an awesomeeee low cost of living. I love the place. Also, looks like it is very likely an Amazon warehouse will be moving in just 25 minutes away from me in the next few years. Which could line RIGHT up with me finishing up my degree. Could be perfect. 
-
Now, I'm not going to lie. A big reason why I chose MIS, outside of the confidence of succeeding in the field, is the pay. You don't walk off that stage making less than $60k a year. That's almost twice what I'm doing now and that's just starting pay. 
-
I'm going to the University of Central Arkansas. Which has an excellent program for MIS. 
-
    Now, the financial stuff..
My first semester back, I'm taking just 3 classes to get back in the groove. Microeconomics to get it out of the way cause it's required for MIS, Biology for a gen ed, and Nutrition for another gen ed that's easy to pad the GPA stats. I signed up for the best professors &amp; classes literally 2 minutes after the 5 AM window opened for picking classes. I'm not fucking this shit up like my dumb ass 18 year old self.
-
I'm still at my bartending job. Despite wanting to move on with my life, I thankfully work with some of my best friends and I make good money. Also, most importantly, because of my seniority, they can work with my class schedule. So, this is what I have devised:
-
    Class Day Schedule:
    - 9:30AM-10:40AM
    - 12:15PM-1:30PM
    - 2:40PM-3:55PM

    MON: Off
    TUE: Class Day Schedule
    WED: 3PM-5PM Lab
    THU: Class Day Schedule &amp; Work @ 9PM-3AM
    FRI: Work either Double or 8PM-3AM
    SAT: Work either Double or 8PM-3AM
    SUN: Work 8PM-3AM

- I wanted to make sure I wasn't getting off at 3 AM the night of having to get to class at 9:45AM.
- Thursdays are gonna suck, it's possible I can occasionally work those. But, Scott Steiner math suggests I Don't Be A Pussy and just red bull it up and work that Thursday anyways.
-
    Work Info:
    With those 4 days of working, I should be able to pull $600-$700 a week.
    Knock off one night and move it to 3 days of working, $500-$600 a week.

    Utilities
My rent is around **$550** a month after utilities splitting a 1,500 square foot home with 2 roommates. Being older and having experience with having up to 7 roommates at the same time, I just can't do more than 2. Preferably, I'd be by myself, but the world is not perfect. Oh, and I'm a 5 minute drive away from campus.

* ***Food cost is around $400ish*** as I also do some bodybuilding and the occasional dates with the lady.

* The rest of my bills between health insurance, phone bill, gym, netflix, Adobe Suite (sidework), etc is about **$430 a month**. Sooooo..

* Bills + Rent/Utilities + Food = **roughly $1,400 a month**

* Working 4 days with stacking one work night a week on class schedule, I should be able to roughly expect **$2,400 a month.**

**Leaves $1,000 aside** for anything in the world that could happen. Life shit. I also have a girlfriend. She is very supportive and awesome and is more frugally minded anyways. So, we can have just as good of a time hanging out at home vs. going out often.

    But Student Loans Now...my main inquiry..
I'm expecting to be able to get grants and possibly scholarships next semester in the fall after I get my GPA up and I have this time of the year to apply.

* I can get 2 loans with my university. Subsidized which will cover my tuition this semester ($3,100). Along with an unsubsidized loan for $5,300. I obviously need the subsidized loan so I can have my tuition covered. The unsub I'm wrestling around with.
* In all honesty, I'm not too concerned about getting into debt with student loans, because I will be increasing my earnings from **$40k a year** full time before college *(which, the timeline left on that job is probably only 2 years max and I do not want to continue that line of work)* to starting at **$60k a year**. Possibly up to **$80k a year** and then with some years of working, I could get up to over **$100k** easily.

So, $40k-$50k in student loan debt seems more of a Spend Money to Make Money situation to me.

* If I took both the sub &amp; unsub loans. That would also allow me to not worry about work. Be able to give shifts up when I need to for extra studying/project time. As, it has been 10 years since I've been in school. Now, I'm serious about it and want to be at the top of my class in every class. This is my future in my hands.

* Taking the $5,300 unsub loan would give an extra $1,000+ a month during school that could be used to cover all of my living expenses.

Then, the money I make at work? I save.

* Obviously, I'm taking on debt. So, I'm not exactly saving. But, I save that money until I graduate, then I can put an immediate HUGE dent into my student loans. And, I also have the money for anything that comes up, such as moving into a new place. Car breaking down. Etc, etc. Which brings me toooooo...

*      Should I buy a house?**

I currently live in a rent house. It's $1,150 a month before utilities that I split with 2 other roommates. I've already lived in the same city for 10 years. And with school, I'm locked in for another 3 years. 

* My credit score is 717.

Of course, that's before the loans. That's right now. After rent and utlities (I pay more for the bigger room with its own bathroom), I'm averaging $550 a month. Sometimes a little lower, sometimes a little higher. I could see me and my girlfriend eventually wanting to move in together. 

* My lease is up in May and then it moves to month to month. 

My current situation is fine. But, staying here for school the next 3 years, rent minus utilities....just rent, is gonna cost me **$15,000+.**

* Perhaps I should buy a house instead? I could get something decent for around $110k-$140k. That's 1,200-1,500 square foot, 3 beds &amp; 2 bathrooms usually. I could still have a roommate/my girlfriend pay me rent so I'm not eating the whole thing.

If I need to move after graduating, I could just make it a rent house.

However, I ended up hating it, so I applied as a transfer to three public universities in my state (NY). My admission to these schools was essentially based on my high school grades and SAT scores since I'm only a freshman. However, they did require me to send my college transcript.

Since sending the transcript, I withdrew from two classes, which will have Ws next to them because I dropped after the ""grace period"". I was trying my best to succeed in one of them (Calc II), and the other course was supposed to help me with that. Also, my grades are going to be absolute crap. I was in a really bad funk this semester for a multitude of reasons, which I didn't disclose to any of my professors. I didn't want to seem like a whiner. My family is struggling financially, the first anniversary of my dad's death is coming up, and I dislike my college. I'm really worried that the university to which I'm transferring will rescind my offer of admission, and I'll either be stuck at my current college or in community college (which, honestly, I'm not completely opposed to).

If this all seems like a jumble of nonsense, I apologize. I'm pretty stressed out at the moment trying to save my GPA.  Any and all advice is appreciated. 

TL;DR: originally going to attend A college, had to attend B college for financial reasons. End up hating B college, applies to transfer to C college and is admitted.  Accepts offer from C college, but worried offer will be rescinded b/c of shitty grades due to personal and financial reasons. Need advice.

1269,CapableJack,1511774419,/r/college/comments/7ftzad/5_extra_classes_to_take_in_college_that_benefit/,"When you’re in college, it can be really easy to focus on your major so much; you forget to study for the sake of studying. Remember the French classes in high school you took and now hope you had retained just a bit better?

&amp;nbsp;

College is probably the last time in your life you’re in a learning environment all the time. If you can do it, it’s also the perfect time to branch out just a little. One of my favorite moments in branching out was taking a class on the history of Freemasonry, which turned out to be both as boring and interesting as you’d think. But you can do better than that.

&amp;nbsp;

In this blog post, we’ll look at five types of extra classes that will benefit everyone in college. Even when they don’t immediately seem related to your field, they will make you a better student, better thinker, or teach you skills that will benefit you in life overall. Here are the five best extra classes to take outside of your major:

&amp;nbsp;

**PHILOSOPHY (AND ETHICS)**
In a sense, philosophy classes will teach you the art of thinking. Even if you take just an introductory class, you will learn some critical thinking, the structure of solid argumentations, improve your logical thinking skills and maybe even scientific literacy. Aside from that, philosophy is one of the best ways to attribute to your general knowledge, giving you more appreciation for literature, movies, and other forms of culture.
While you may already be interested in philosophy after a couple of beers or when you’re taking an extra-long shower, most philosophy classes will come with reading materials that will take genuine effort to get through. That’s not a bad thing, but it’s good to know up front.

&amp;nbsp;

**MATH (AND STATISTICS)**
With the growing importance of math and algorithms in everyday life, a good understanding of math will help you. Combined with statistics, it will give you a way to quantify more in your life (express in numbers what usually cannot be counted). This may sound a bit cold and robotic, but thinking mathematically can help you make decisions.
Additionally, a good statistics class can help you understand the world better. More specifically, you can better filter how the world is presented to you and use your own judgment when it comes to deciding who and what to believe. We all know how easy it is to lie with statistics, and as with everything, it’s a lot harder to lie to someone who understands the basics.

&amp;nbsp;

**PSYCHOLOGY**
To me, psychology is the perfect second major. It can be a valuable addition to literally any field. At the very least, understanding how we are a product of environmental influences, brain chemistry and group processes will ultimately help you understand yourself and others a little bit better.
A good psychology class can definitely help your soft skills. When done well, it’s the textbook version of walking a mile in someone else’s shoes. Even when you have just taken introductory classes, the concepts behind psychology will give you an edge whenever you’re dealing with people after college.

&amp;nbsp;

**LANGUAGE**
I know, this is a bit broad, but that’s by design. You can either interpret this as a calling to study a foreign language, hone your writing skills, or gain a better appreciation of literature. If you don’t feel a calling, I’d personally nudge you towards improving your writing skills. Even if you think you’ll never write a paper or assignment in your life again, thinking of how to improve your writing will make you a better communicator, which sounds a lot more appealing.
The foreign language and literature ideas are a bit more overall development, but perfectly align with the broader message of this blog post: you’re in college to learn, so make use of that environment. And maybe a foreign language course will help you in your travels abroad. You don’t have to be fluent in Spanish to understand signs and ask for the bathrooms.

&amp;nbsp;

**CLASSICAL SCIENCE (PHYSICS)**
To some people (me), physics ARE a foreign language. In high school, I finished the chemistry class because the teacher pitied me and I dropped all forms of hard core science the moment I could. Late in my college years, I almost enrolled in a class called physics for creative students. I still regret not actually going through with it.
Even when you’ve convinced yourself you only have the right side of your brain, physics will teach you the fundamentals of science and a new way to solve problems. If you want problem-solving on your resume, studying physics will back you up.

I have a low estimate of a 1.5 in chem, and I had a 2.0 in calc, but I got a 47% on my exam the other day.

I just don't know what I'm doing wrong.  I took calc last year, and I studied for 3 days for my calc exam (in addition to review in class)(I was doing really well on all of the practice exams).  I do the homework, get *decent* scores on quizzes... something just isn't clicking.  I emailed my professor and asked him if he could go over my exam with my and try to help me pass with an office hours session, and he said that I can come in next week.  So I will be doing that.  My first exam, I got a 72, which he said was good, so I wasn't as worried.  Now I am very very worried that I won't pass.

With chem, my first exam I got a 76, and my second, a 61.  I studied for a week for the second one and it still didn't work.  I will be scheduling office hours with this professor as well.

I do have a final in calc to take, and my lowest 2 quiz grades get dropped, so that will help.... but a 47%!?!?!? are you kidding!? and a 61 on chem!?!? I just feel very discouraged.  We didn't have to take exams in high school so I feel that apparently I don't know how to study for them, and this isn't helping.

Spring 2017
Dropped out entirely mid semester (Worth 4 Ws)


New Community College

1 W


Why do I have all these Ws? Half of them were me being an immature student, half was just...life.


After all the transferring, I am technically on my 4th year of college and I only have 25 miserable credits to show for it. I am beyond depressed right now. But I have to finish college, somehow I have to. I need to. I will absolutely not be a college dropout. Yet, I hate it with every fiber of my being. I just want to get it over with.


With that said, this is obviously not the mentality you have in mind when sacrificing hours of effort into a degree. But I feel like I can't stand any of the material. It's all just pointless, tortorous dribble to me as a means to get hired at a decent job. I could care less about what I am learning. I just want that degree. And sadly, my transcript shows that.


If there's one thing I learned about myself in college it's that I have a knack for writing and using words. College is an investement and it feels like any degree that isn't something immediately useful like business or nursery is just a massive waste of money and time. So my question is, are there any useful, profitable college majors/careers that are heavy in writing that I can immediately use to find a job once I'm done? Please be blunt with me.

I recently made the decision to change to Business, but enough about that. This will be a bit of a long read, but I'll put a TLDR at the end.

For as long as I can remember, I've had feelings of anxiety, depression, and semi-suicidal thoughts, among other things. They've been building for years now, and I kept quiet because I thought that I would look weak for choosing or even wanting to go to therapy.

I think some parts of my childhood contributed to a lot of my current feelings. From infancy to the age of 7, it was customary for my parents to fight like hell on weekends. Imagine, a young child, supposed to worry about how many pancakes he'll be able to eat on Saturday, having to worry about his mother and father screaming at each other, throwing things, threatening for divorce, etc. It SUCKED. Even now, I still do this thing when I'm home where I gauge how they are with one another. I hated seeing them fight when I was a kid, it really hurt me. I knew and know that they love me, but I was just so fearful of them drifting away from each other. One time, my mom walked out of our apartment, and I had to chase after her, crying. Another time, my dad dropped her off in a parking lot with me in the back, and told her, ""Have a nice life."". I started crying on the spot. My sister never had to see it as much; they really lessened their arguments after her birth.

My main feelings of depression and anxiety started in my sophomore or junior year in high school. I wasn't exactly in the best position academically at the time due to some friend problems that really hit me hard. Toward the end of sophomore year, I started questioning if it was good that I was born, primarily because my academics weren't going well and I had grown distant from people who I thought were my friends. In addition, I asked these questions internally because I felt like me (and my sister being born) were the only things keeping their marriage together. There were a lot of instances where my mother and father told me that I was just a cross to bear, but that was mainly because they were angry for things I said or did.

The summer after my sophomore year, I think I remember June 2015 more for sleeping than anything else. I just felt so angry at myself and tired and lonely that I curled up on my basement couch and snuggled under a blanket. I only got up to eat, shower, use the bathroom, or work out (occasionally). I was a lot more irritable. I was very high strung, due to falling outs that I had with ""friends"" and my grades sinking, and I took out my anger (vocally) onto my family. After a month, I got up (since I had SAT/ACT prep and tennis offseason) and told myself that I had to get my shit together. It worked that year, I moved higher up on the tennis team's ladder, my grades improved, things were good. And then I got one B on my junior year report card. One B out of several As. The depression hit again; I felt like a fuck-up. But I wanted to slay the next year of high school.

My senior year was more known for the extreme falling out I had with a friend. This same friend was a source of anger and trouble for me in my sophomore year. He wanted my help for college apps and academics. Now, me being more of a yes man than I should be, I said 'yes'. But then, I started thinking harder about if it was the right move; hey, he could turn on me, fuck me over or something. So I decided to shift away from him. He noticed, and retaliated strongly. He told ANOTHER friend of mine some lie about me wanting to kill him, and I lost this person's friendship. I had had enough, I wanted to cut him off for good, away from me. But he didn't get it; he followed me around, tried to sit next to me everywhere. Because of this, for most of my senor year, I was angry. I would wake up angry some days, go to bed angry. Wake up sad some days, go to bed sad some days. It grew really hard having to wake up in the morning, knowing I had to go to school and deal with him. All the while, I got into 10/15 schools, got two scholarships to one of them, and am attending that one now (Fuck Michigan. :P). Eventually, he stopped after I raised my voice to him one day. We never spoke again, but after senior year, and even during the summer, I felt really insecure about the whole thing. I thought he was trying to throw subtle jabs and disrespectful remarks my way whenever we saw each other, and I thought he wanted to fight me. So, what did I do but work out like crazy, lose a lot of weight, gain some muscle, etc. I think it was more obsessive than anything, to be honest.
Now, to the main part:

I attend a good college near the Midwestern US. I started school in mid-August. Now, like all freshmen, I missed home a lot. My family built such a good home life for me in recent years, that I was too adjusted to and comfortable with. Now, I say missed, but I mean to say ""miss"". I miss it a lot. I miss driving my car, seeing my friends, sleeping in my bed, etc. It's put me in bad spells this semester, where it's really hard to get out of bed in the morning.

I can't trace back to when this first started happening, but lately, I think I've had more concrete suicidal thoughts. Like, before going to a math recitation, I went to the bathroom, and looked at the courtyard below. I thought, ""Man, it would be so easy to jump down and end it all right here."". Today, after a less than ideal Engineering midterm (probably failed), I thought about how easy it would be to go back to my room, take a lot of pills, and end my life. These thoughts have been cutting into me lately. I had these thoughts when I had my math midterm, when I did my CS midterm yesterday, and even today with my engineering one. They've just been ramping up even more and more with each passing day, and I'm scared now.

I've gone to see counseling, I do group therapy and one-on-one, but it isn't enough. It doesn't feel like enough. Plus, I'm so worried about my slipping grades too, so that's been adding to my self-loathing and thoughts of ending it. I feel like I study a lot, try to learn (not just memorize), but when it comes time to step up to the plate, I blank and mess things up now.

In addition, I may have an attention problem of some kind. I see the tasks I need to do, I make a plan for it, but then the plan goes to shit and doesn't get followed. I get easily distracted by things near me or around me, and it's hard to put my phone away. Plus, I've exhibited some compulsive behavior as well, such as checking my grades over and over to see if assignments have come in, even if they haven't yet or if I just took them that day.

Last, I think another problem is that I just never wanted to study CS. I primarily picked it up to make my parents happy. All I've ever wanted was to make them happy and proud of me. If I had chosen business, I would be a direct admit right now, which makes me regret choosing CS. I think this also adds to my depression, knowing that a better choice existed for me but I didn't take it. CS, and engineering in general here, feels really gloomy. No instructor, TA, or anyone seems happy, whereas the people I've met over in the business school are seemingly so driven and animated in how they do things.

So, here's where my big question comes in: is a leave of absence the right move? If I'm really having this much anxiety, depression, and this many suicidal thoughts, and if counseling isn't helping here, AND if my grades are declining because of these things, would a leave of absence be the right move? I think these things have been building for years, and the time when they burst out most for people (college) is hurting it more. I never talked about it all those years because I was afraid and felt weak for even considering going to therapy, and I feared disappointing or embarrassing my parents.

My idea is to go back home for this semester, and come back next semester with a better handle on my issues. I've called the financial aid office already about how this might affect my scholarship, and have talked to my academic advisor already about it. My advisor has given me the forms needed to petition for a leave of absence.

TLDR: Have had semi-suicidal/existential thoughts, depressive feelings, and anxiety in the past, seems to have ramped up in college as well, but to the point where my thoughts of suicide are more concrete. Have also exhibited obsessive and attention problems that may have gone unnoticed by many. Grades are slipping, and I don't feel happy at this time with what I do or am doing.",college,Is leave of absence the right choice?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7bhkmf/is_leave_of_absence_the_right_choice/,1510118960.0

It’s just a random late night thought I had. Please enlighten me with your wisdom and thoughts on this. It just made me wonder where society would be if we all were able to obtain a college education and what we can do to get there. 

I know financial aid works kind of in this way, but only so much is given to certain people. But for the people who can’t afford school period, who can’t get financial aid and can’t afford school, or ppl who can afford it, for everyone, this could be great. 

Basically everyone would go to school for “free” (aside from supplies and a few fees, or if one chooses to make tuition payments right away for less interest accumulation) and then once graduated or dropped out (aka no longer a student) interest would start building up and they would pay back the loans as usual, making it financially easier with the degrees they earned at the cost of the education. This way higher education wouldn’t discriminate against income or discourage lower class people from obtaining a degree. That way anyone who wants to attend college, can. And this way people wouldn’t have to work AS hard for money for school, and are able to put more focus towards their education and only really work for what they need outside of educational needs.

1282,CaptnCosmic,1509413619,/r/college/comments/79sg8w/certainly_failing_out_of_college_21_years_old_and/,"Right now, I am currently in my third year of college. My freshman year I passed all my courses with A’s and B’s with no issues at all. I got into my sophomore year and failed almost every class I took that year. My junior year (the first semester, which I am currently in) I am on that same track of failing all my courses. 

Let me explain the reason I believe this complete decline in grades happened:

-Going to an out of state school posed many problems for someone like me who has never been good at making friends and socializing to new people. This was an entirely different world for me, I was basically starting a new life knowing not a single person.
-in my time here at my college, my personal life went from being positive to very negative. During my first year, my older brother got into a VERY bad heroin addiction. In and out of rehab, until he got in a car wreck that severely injured him and he had to go back to our hometown. In the time he was back, he relapsed again and overdosed, he fortunately lived even though the doctor said majority of those who have the type of OD he had wouldn’t have a chance. 
-while hearing of my brothers life being torn apart, in the same two years (my sophomore and junior) my parents got a divorce and moved apart. 

in no way, am I saying these things were the SOLE cause of my academics dwindling, but I do feel as if they were factors that lead me to not go to class, hang out with friends, study, do homework, etc. I don’t go out at all anymore to socialize, I literally have not hung out with my friends in so long I can’t even remember. I stay in my room all day, even if my roommates have a bunch of people over and are having a good time, I act like I’m not even there if people knock on my door on occasions...

Right now, I feel as I am at the lowest point I have ever been in my life. I have no clue what to tell my parents (especially my dad). My brother dropped out of his first year of college, and that disappointed my dad more than anything. And now that his second and only son is about to fail out after 3 years of paying, just let’s me know I’m a failure to him. I have been trying to prove to my parents that I am not like my brother, I don’t smoke or do drugs and BARELY drink.  But getting kicked out of school I feel like will just make my parents feel like they failed completely and I don’t think I could stand hurting my parents like this after all they have done for me. Has anyone been in a situation even remotely like this? And if so, how did you deal with it? What makes me just not motivated to do anything at all anymore? Any advice on how to bounce back?",college,"Certainly failing out of college, 21 years old and no clue what to do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/79sg8w/certainly_failing_out_of_college_21_years_old_and/,1509431619.0

I'm a 24 year old Biomedical Engineering student with a full time night job. I work 1-9am and go to school during the day. I'm currently taking 7 credits (it was 11; I'll get into that).

I've found through trial and error that about 9 credits is all I can handle while working full time, especially since most of my classes involve labs, so that's basically like another class. I'm finding it hard to concentrate due to mental illness, also I just moved out of my parents' house in July, so I'm struggling to find a routine.

Hence why I was taking 11 credits this semester, but dropped one class. This particular class is very demanding, and does involve a lab. Also, the lecture portion was from 5:30-6:45, which is normally when I'm sleeping (I usually sleep from 4-midnight), so I was falling asleep in almost every class. I was marked as ""at risk of failing"" due to a low midterm grade. I figured there was no way I could redeem this, so I figure I'll take it next semester.

My problem is, is it worth it to keep working full time if it means taking less classes (and being in school until I'm 30)? I actually like how I'm doing it, I'm not overly stressed, I still get the money I need for rent, food, bills, etc, and I still have a life. I actually enjoy school, so being here longer doesn't really bother me.

But I've had multiple coworkers (who all have degrees) tell me that pushing through, going full time, and getting it done is the best way to go, either because 1) it's cheaper because tuition goes up every year, 2) because I'll start to see the same people in my major and make friends, which is essential to success in college, or 3) I'll get out of my current workplace and make better money sooner (I've been here for three years and there's no room for advancement, plus my yearly raises are starting to get smaller and smaller because I'm making more money and corporate doesn't want to pay me more). A couple of them have suggested multiple times that I should go part time at work and focus on school, but I'm afraid that I won't have enough money to pay my bills (I'm already struggling and I'm still full time, but that could be because of the move and trying to settle into a new lifestyle).

That being said, I also hate my job, and want out of it fast, and the thought of going back for a more practical degree that will get me a higher paying job that will bore me but leave me more secure is both tempting and scary. I am building a portfolio regardless of pay in my free time. Outside of that, I have had a ton of trouble finding writing jobs, freelance or otherwise. 

Are there just not a lot of jobs relating to creative writing out there/the market is too saturated?

Do you think my passion for either English or Journalism is worth going back to school for, despite starting as a comp sci major? Or should I do those on the side and go for something else?

Do you feel like there are other careers that are more practical careers that would “scratch the itch” of writing?

Any additional advice? 

More about me below if you care:

I’m a college dropout.  A one two punch of mental illnesses and not being good at the major (computer science) killed it for me.Thankfully (or unfortunately for my poor, loving parents) they paid for it, so no debt. I dropped out, found the right combo of meds and psychiatry, worked retail for two years, then worked my way around to a recruiting job that pays me enough to be self sufficient and gives me healthcare, but not much else. I also hate it, the exception being when I was writing a guide for new hires on my own (as I felt the training they got was inadequate).

I did a lot of soul searching after dropping out and realized I wanted to do something creative relating to writing. Well, I always knew, but couldn’t accept it, because I always felt the pressure to be the money maker for a nuclear family I didn’t even want. I could never see a creative field giving me that. Also growing up, I had this sort of battle between my more analytical side and creative side, and felt a career purely in writing wouldn’t satisfy me in that way. While I am also a very analytical person, I am not as much so as my former peers in computer science, and in different ways. I was always someone that like thinking about hypothetical cool characters, stories, ideas, or criticisms of movies or games, and never took a lot of the more “practical” things everyone else did seriously, placing more importance on nitpicking art to the bone by myself.

I recently started writing game reviews at a very small gaming site. They don’t pay me, but they do buy me the games, give me an “official” portfolio of online published work, and are all stand up people. Before that (and still currently) I have been writing on my own and not publishing anything in a sort of unique style of content. though I have a blog set up for when I decide any of it is worth publishing. My dream job would be writing/designing games, or my blog taking off, or some type of gaming journalism/reviewing. I don’t want kids and don’t need a lot of money if my hobbies (writing and gaming) come with the job. Honestly I just like writing (and write better when not stream of consciousness typing on my iPhone at work). But I’m a bit lost on how to approach going back to college (if I should at all) after these years, what I should major in, etc. Questions are above.

I would appreciate some guidance here as I'm in a tough spot. This is my second year of college and am a computer science major. I've been having some mental health issues this semester and I already dropped my math class to help ease the burden, however I'm three weeks behind in my computer science class and I feel it's best to drop that as well as I feel I could catch up, but given the current state I'm in mentally, I feel I can't do it at the same time. I started out with four classes (15 hours), now I'm at 11 with math dropped and will be at 8 with my C++ class dropped. I feel it's in my best interest to do so, but I'm scared that I'm ""wasting"" my withdrawals too early in my school career and I'll never be able to get into a good MBA program in the future (not straight after finishing college). I wanted to drop all my courses this semester as the school wouldn't report it as W's but I can't due to my parents pushing me not to and I feel I can still at least do the two other classes I'm enrolled in. I just don't know what to do and I'm feeling truly lost. I feel that it would be easier to just end my life to be quite honest, but maybe that's just me being a ""baby"".

1287,AWittyNuker,1507163620,/r/college/comments/74cgwf/i_feel_stuck_in_school/,"As a precursor to those who are going to read this, I'm going to start off by saying that I've never been a particularly good student. 
I've had basically the same conversation with my mother every year about how I need to light a fire under my butt and buckle down/focus/etc, since high school basically. I focus for awhile, but it never seems to last. Math is not my strong suit in particular.

Where am I now? Well, I've attended a California community college for four years now. My original intention was to complete the CSU general transfer agreement and try to get into a good school, but I was steered into getting an associate's degree along with it by a counselor. She felt that it would improve my odds of getting into Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, where I was hoping to go.

But I've been here for four years, and I feel as if I've gotten nowhere. I've dropped and failed a few courses, but have retaken them and gotten good grades, and I'm just a few classes short of an associates, but I find myself growing weary of school in general.

But I decided I should stick it out and get a degree and work, save up money, etc. I applied to ASU Online, got in, but haven't registered for classes yet. I had a disheartening chat with an academic advisor, who said that even at 12 units a semester, it would take me three years to get through it. Three more years of school just isn't something I want to subject myself to if I can. On the flip side, applying to a state school would mean that I wait a year to get in, if I can.

Should I stay in community college, finish my associates while applying to a state school? Or should I do upper division coursework online at ASU, maybe transfer to a state school for graduation, or finish up there?

The rest of my life has continued to move forward, I've held a few jobs, been in a long term relationship since high school, and that's something that I feel very confident in, perhaps the only thing in my life I feel confident in. But I feel that this relationship and the relationship with my parents is becoming strained at my own inability to move forward. I also feel incredibly dumb and often compare myself to my peers, who are graduated or graduating.

I'm open to any suggestions and constructive criticism really, I feel ready to move on from all this stress. I really do appreciate if you read all this, thank you in advance.

For those 3 years school was simple, I lived my life and went to school. I led an active social life, had a job all that. 

Now I’m away at college have no friends and no job. All I have is school. One thing I’ve realized is that I really enjoy spending time by myself. 

I spend 90% of my free time writing, making art, or making music. 

When I got here I was so lonely that I would’ve dropped literally everything just to hang out with someone. I guess I never really was one to do things on my own. 

Now I cancel plans just to sit in my apartment and write music and make things. I love learning about instruments, and different techniques for my creative endeavors. 


I used to be really sheltered about my projects. I would’ve had a crisis if someone had read or heard my music. Now I actively look for people to read and critique my stuff. I’m getting a lot of positive feedback which is encouraging, but honestly I just want to know how I can keep improving. 

I feel a sense of liberty that make spending the rest of my life in academia seem like a massive disappointment. I hate being at college now. 


To paraphrase a line from a Beautiful Mind, one of the guys tells another guy that the only reason he feels the need to accomplish something academic is because it’s the only way he’ll feel special or worth a damn. 

This struck a chord with me when I was watching the movie, and I turned the movie off and immediately began to stop being like that.


School has been a constant source of validation. You could sit me in a course for just about anything and I’ll be a model student. I’ve come to realize that just because I’m interested in everything, doesn’t mean I should give my attention to everyone. 

I was taught that you can do anything with enough work and I took it to hard. I ignored the signs by just telling myself that if I wasn’t doing well I just needed to try harder. 


I chose science because of two reasons 

1) Security 
2) challenge.


It’s not just about security and challenge. Video games can be challenging, it doesn’t mean I should spend the rest of my life playing difficult video games.

I internalized the challenge that science poses, and used it as a surrogate for my personality..


FOR EXAMPLE: 

When I got to college I LITERALLY could not describe myself past my major. 


The only things I had going for me was I read a lot of books. Books about what? Science! 

Did I read these because it was fun? Fuck no, I read them because I felt I had to in order to succeed. I read them because I had questions that needed answers. 

I’ve read books about Philosophy and Mathematics just so I could answer completely tangential questions.


I couldn’t even name my favorite genre of music until now. I’m at the point where I feel like I’m finally human. I’ve literally been a robot from 10th grade up until now, my fourth year of college. 




Tl;Dr

The best case scenario for the current path I’m on ends with me being a Lab Drone. 

The only thing I want to do with my time is make things. I will work literally any job that affords me enough money to pursue my creative interest.

Upon graduating high school, I decided I had the enthusiasm and motivation to pursue art school, thinking I'd acquire a degree in illustration. Two years in, I lost my love for drawing.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I was pressured all my life into going to college by family and friends. I'm starting my 5th year with only 80 credits to show for it. I've been failing enough that I have to submit another appeal to regain financial aid, in addition to the one I did last year. I'm over $35,000 in debt and at least $10,000 of that is in my mom's name through private loans. My mom has no idea about my failures in schooling or the depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts I deal with daily. The first time I submitted the appeal late and couldn't get aid on time so I told her I needed to get private loans because I registered too late in the semester.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I told her I was depressed several years ago and got a response akin to ""Learn to deal with it/Get over it, it happens to everyone."" I can't afford therapy for both monetary and time reasons at the moment. I tried it many years ago and it seemed to help a small amount but I was only given 6 sessions after my suicide attempt (this was around 5 years ago). And to those worried, while I do still regularly have suicidal thoughts, it won't happen. A very long story short, I made a promise to a girl that can and will not be broken.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I currently work a 45 hour a week job at a gas station, which I really don't mind by itself, though I'm also taking a full 15 credits at school. I hardly sleep due to time constraints and general insomnia, and I can't reduce credit hours without losing the loans I can (potentially) get after my appeal, and I have to maintain the work hours to keep my apartment. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I've been single for 3 years since my fiancée left me after 4.5 years aside from a short fling with a girl for a few weeks, definitely not  relationship. I only mention this as I'm a very physically intimate (think cuddling, not sex) person and it's definitely not helping my mental state. I've got very few real life friends, and all but one I speak to less than weekly. I've got a handful of good friends online, but I don't often talk about any of my issues when we're gaming as I try to use that time to avoid the stresses in my life (not that they wouldn't listen, but I need a space where I can relax). Most of my free time is spent at home, I rarely go out with friends due to a combination of social anxiety, lack of funds, and lack of invites. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I smoke weed and cigarettes nearly constantly as it helps me maintain some semblance of control over my anxiety, and used to heavily abuse opiates, prescription stimulants, and benzos, though I've quit opiates and stimulates completely and my benzo use, while still illegal, has dropped to a minimum. I only use them for unbearable anxiety or panic attacks. It isn't anything I believe I need addiction therapy for, though I'll admit I'm possibly wrong. My usage drops immensely or completely stops when life stresses temporarily fade, and when I do occasionally use benzos I stick to the amounts others I know are generally prescribed, and near what I believe I would be prescribed if I could afford the necessary visits and prescriptions. Another stress reliever for me, however paradoxical it may be, is helping others with their issues. I've always had quite the hero complex. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I wish I had never attended college or at least not an such an early age and just found a job that would let me work a normal schedule and then leave my work at work. My mother would certainly freak if I were to tell her any of this, though with that said she is a loving and caring mother. I'm afraid I'd be excommunicated or disowned, even if that may not be the most likely of cases, I definitely don't enjoy making her upset. Even taking a semester off would require repayment of loans, an amount I likely wouldn't be able to afford. I don't want an extravagant life, just a stable one and I'm just not sure who I should talk to or what I can even do. 


I'm lost, desperate, and scared. Please, I need help.

1296,TheSymposiumGuy,1505259019,/r/college/comments/6zqt7n/question_about_my_cs_degree_financial_aid_ect/,"Okay, well, a little about me.. I'm 28, I started college late after working several years after high school.. I'm about 3 years into a community college, where I worked my way up from the lowest math classes, english classes, ect and have now taken pretty much every computer programming class available at my cc, but I'm still lacking a ton in the math department in order to transfer out.. Here's the dilemma:

I'm currently on FAFSA and depend on the pell grant to go to school (I study all week and work fri/sat/sun but depend on the pell grant for the extra cash needed for school) and I just won my 150% appeal, which was a huge stress for me and put me on automatic probation.. But now, I have a feeling I won't be passing my Calc 2 class so next semester I'll probably have my financial aid once again revoked.. I've attempted calc 2 once before and received a W after I dropped it, knowing I wasn't gonna pass.. I'm doing a lot better in this new Calc 2 class then I did last time, but I'm still at a low C and doubt I'll be able to keep it (although I will try my hardest.) 

So now I'm just trying to review my options just in case I don't pass Calc 2 again... Which are to continue on with my schooling WITHOUT financial aid (which would be damn near impossible for me) and attempt Calc 2 for a third time. Or, to take the LAST programming class I need to take in order to get my AS in computer science and try to get right into the work force from there.. I've been holding off on taking this class in order to keep myself available to receive FAFSA.. But if I lose out on my aid that doesn't matter anymore.

I guess.. In the long run, is it worth struggling (I only say struggle because of the math classes, I actually enjoy pretty much everything else at my cc) through this final year at my CC and then at a university/state college for 2 more years to get my bachelors in computer science? Or would I be better off taking the final programming class that I need for next semester, pair that with some sort of code camp, and then get my AS and head from there? 

I know this is a really specific question, but maybe a fellow CS major has been in my shoes? Or someone can point me in the right direction to ask such a question as this? Thank you all!

edit: Okay, I calmed down a bit.. I realized the semester is still early and the lowest quiz score is dropped, so I just need to switch my focus 100% to calc II (I'm taking a java and history class also, but I know how to program with java already and the history class is rather easy) and just kick butt on the midterm... I can't let something as stupid as a calculus 2 class hold me back from my dreams! Still, the question I had earlier is one I'm curious about.. Any folks out there who shelved their quest for a BS in CS and still made a success with their AS? Or vice versa?

I've spent two YEARS figuring out what degree I wanted, screwed around in school and didn't care about my grades. Now married, I realize I now that I need to get my shit together.

I found a college that's 50 mins away from me where I can get my bachelors in nutrition (my community college doesn't offer any nutrition classes) 

Here's my issue and what has me scared: in order to finish my bachelors, I'll have to quit working part time which makes my husband the only source of income and that has me worried. Another thing is that I didn't qualify for financial aid because again, I screwed around my first year in college and dropped a bunch of courses and made Ds and Fs. My current GPA sits at an 1.89 (that's including dropped courses, not including those I sit at a 2.09 apparently.) in order for me to get into the dietetics program at this school, my GPA needs to be at lest a 3.25 OR i can chose to just finish my bachelors there then transfer to a private school where the GPA requirement for the program is 2.75
My issue with that is the tuition is 49,000 a year. 

I want to fix my GPA, get a good degree and get a decent job but I'm worried it's too late to turn this around but I don't want to give up on a better future.

1298,mushroompizza1,1504993703,/r/college/comments/6z4gi3/dropped_out_after_first_week_need_advice/,"So I need to go on a rant. My first week was awful, I understand college isn't represented by the first week. The annoyances of gitty partying freshmen and boring welcome lectures will pass and classes will start. I was ready for my first day of class and couldn't wait for Welcome Week to be over start learning about my interests and join some clubs. Well the clubs sucked and I was lonely, I knew eventually I'd find my place on campus, no worries. 

Then classes started. The first day I was totally unable to even access my homework let alone do it. My ADD was killing my academics on the first day and creating anger issues. Naturally I got angry that I couldn't do the work but I couldn't do anything about it so the anger would spiral out of control exhausting me. Now I was royally fucked. After day 1 I had to go see a doctor because of it. My routine consisted of poor attention in class, getting immediately confused at homework and then having an anger meltdown. Classes were impossible, my anxiety started coming back because I was stuck. After Day 3 of classes and an anxiety attack that took me to the hospital I was done. 

I dropped out the next day. I realized if college was going to be an olympic challenge for me I just want to be comfortable at home. When Im flipping my shit I don't want to be across the country in a dorm with only my dumb roommate. 

So I guess I'll head back home and apply to a college in town and take it slow. Talk to my Disability Resource Center about how I can make a custom schedule for my ADD. I know I made the right decision, if I stayed there I'd either spend my days sanely playing frisbee with friends while I failed classes or go insane from the studying for classes and become and alcoholic from the extra stress. 

So I need advice. My goal is to leave home (but unfortunately that failed) and become a regular college student. My dream school is Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and get a PhD in Political Science. How do I get there from my current situation?

Private universities, due to their cost, SEEM to be a little more forgiving from what I have collected. The waiting list for most community colleges is just a bit too long. 
  
I guess my question has to do with qualifying for financial aid. While my GI bill will cover most of the cost of tuition, there still will be some money I have to come up with. Obviously right now, due to how much I make, I doubt I would qualify for anything. The problem is, I would be quitting my job to go back to school full time.

Let me preface this by stating that I am 20 years old and go to a local college that is a sister school of a much larger college, tuition is drastically lower but the degree still wears the name of the larger institution.

I started off college deciding that I would go into CIT or Computer Information Technology, fast forward about two years and I've recently decided that I no longer desire to be in this field mainly because I only like networking and dislike programming and databases as a whole.

I've also in this time learned that I enjoy working and interacting with people as well as selling products so I was thinking advertising would be a good place for me to be, given my background in technology and knowledge of how the internet works I figured a job in some form of internet advertisement job or even standard advertisement job would be a valid option.

However at the same time, I can't help but feel like I made a mistake given how far along I was in the tech program (Would've been a Junior this semester). I feel like this feeling might just be the fact that whenever I imagined my future self it would be doing something with computers but, I've changed a lot and I'm just wondering if maybe the nostalgia and 'future visions' of myself are just making me doubt my decision to switch?

Should I just stick it out? I've dropped most of my tech classes for this semester and replaced them with classes that would transfer to advertising? Has anyone else had this feeling when switching majors?

TL;DR: Are feelings of uneasiness standard when thinking about switching majors?

I did not know what I wanted to do in life when I was learning there and never really thought far of the future. As a result, I did not care about my grades, had a GPA from from 1.8-2.0 and thus no college would ever accept someone like me upon graduating senior year. I kinda just knew by junior year I would end up at my local community college but it never quite **hit** me until I got there. I'm not stupid but I won't deny I was lazy and had no goals.

When I started my first semester (around Sept. 2015) there I still did not know what I wanted to do so I decided to major in something random like Computer Science. I then decided to switch to Psychology towards the end of it. Starting second semester I continued doing good in my general ed. classes but horrible in the Psychology classes and it wasn't in my heart to become a Psychologist or anywhere near that field so I dropped the classes. 

After I withdrew the classes, summer came up and I spent my summer break pondering what I truly wanted to do. Towards the end of it, I decided and felt and had a revelation where's I decided that majoring in something regarding the world of Business would be best for me. The next semester rolls up and I switch my major to Business Administration, pick classes correlating to my major and did amazing and had a 3.6 GPA towards the end. I now feel like I have a solid end goal in my life and know that my primary concern should be getting that degree.

Now my second Spring semester rolls up and I am at a point and standstill where I can't take some of my gen end AND my business classes because I don't have the prerequisites done for it because of my remedial math classes (I forgot to mention that when I was a senior in high school I took the accuplacer for the cc I attend and practically failed all of the math section because I suck terribly at math. Did not know this would have future effects.) I can't take these classes without completing my remedial math first &amp; what sucks even more is I can't take the remedial class along with the business classes. I took the classes I could which was like 4.

Now my next semester is coming up. I have 36 credits complete out of the 60 I need in total. Only 24 left and these fucking remedial classes are what is preventing me from graduating and getting this associate's degree. I registered my classes and will be starting soon. This all goes back to my original question:

To make a long story somewhat short, my college career has been damaged and greatly prolonged due to undiagnosed and untreated bipolar disorder. I entered and dropped out twice within two years, and as such, my record now sports a nice host of 7 or so Ws. After my second disatrous attempt at college, however, I took a year and a half off, received my diagnosis and some much-needed therapy, saved up a good chunk of money, and embarked on a bit of soul-searching. I tepidly enrolled at my local community college, frankly expecting little from myself and from the school, but discovered under the direction of a wonderful professor (whose own college experience, I might add, mirrors my own) a passion for philosophy -- and, a year and three semesters later, I'm maintaining a 4.0 GPA and am soon to be inducted into our school's PTK chapter.

As you might guess, I don't intend to stop with an associate's: I intend to work my way up to the PhD level (and, yes, I'm aware of how grueling this will be), but I feel my academic past poses a significant roadblock to this goal. I'm about to start applying to transfer to a few four-years in order to complete my bachelor's -- nothing outrageously selective (The New School, Michigan, Stony Brook, and Indiana, with a few others up in the air) but still selective enough to really make me worry. I further fear the graduate admissions as, even if I'm admitted to and succeed in a strong program, I still have those two huge scars on my record. Despite this, I have some strong test scores from high school (30 ACT and superscored 2200 SAT, if they even matter at this point), vocal support from my professors, and a hell of a story going for me. The experiences of my mentor and Glenn Loury (an academic whom I admire) further give me a bit of hope, but I just can't shake the fear that all the programs will turn me down.

Here is the problem: the new school I am attending will not honor the academic forgiveness granted to me by my previous school. So my GPA has dropped from a 3.1 to a 2.6 and that means not only was all the work I put in for nothing, but my chances of ever going to grad school have dropped incredibly, and I will be losing my $5000 scholarship.

I am hesitant to do this, however, because this will put me a year behind and I had already planned on taking a year off before starting grad school. 

This really puts a dent in my life plans and I don't know how to process all of this. I never wanted my life to turn out this way, and I know that I am to blame for making some of the grades that I did, but the amount of pressure this puts on me is almost unbearable.

I don't socialize well with my peers, and I am prone to depression and social anxiety..I have stopped attending school due to being incredibly overwhelmed three times in the past two years, switched schools twice and tried homeschool for a few months. Between the first and second time, I dropped a couple of AP/honors courses to see if the academics were an issue. I experienced the same thing months later, despite having all As and easy classes. As it stands, I don't see myself dealing with this for another three years (school just started not too long ago), even though I may have to.

I'm about to start applying to transfer to a few four-years in order to complete my bachelor's -- nothing outrageously selective (The New School, Michigan, Stony Brook, CU Boulder, and Indiana) but still selective enough to really make me worry. I further fear the graduate admissions as, even if I'm admitted to and succeed in a strong program, I still have those two huge scars on my record. Despite this, I have some strong test scores from high school (if they matter at this point), vocal support from my professors, and a hell of a story going for me, and the experiences of my mentor and Glenn Loury give me a bit of hope -- I just can't shake the fear that all the programs will turn me down.

I'll be seeing an academic advisor soon to help with applying for my classes but I don't want to look like a complete idiot in front of him/her. So..basically I'm attending my local CC and I'm doing prerequisites for nursing which requires 60 credit hours for completion and my college allows a maximum of 18 credit hours per semester. What do credit hours exactly translate to? How would I be able to choose how many ""credit hours"" I take? For example, I need to take class 2401 and for one of the classes I can choose from, it shows credit as ""4.000"" and indicates the days Monday and Wednesday..so would that mean I'd be getting 8 credits per week for the duration of the fall term? If I were to add additional classes to that same subject, then I'd be getting 12 credits per week? I honestly have no idea, I'm most likely spouting out completely drivel here. Or wait is it 4 credit hours for that whole semester for that class, meaning I'd be attending class Mondays and Wednesdays and by the end of semester, I'd earn 4 credit hours? Would that be the completion of that prerequisite then I'd be able to move on and do the other prerequisites that I have? But that doesn't make sense considering I need 60 credit hours for completion and I only have three prerequisites needed so how would I amount to that many credits?
Ok, I'm clearly utterly clueless and while, yes, I'll be seeing an advisor, I would like to understand at least the fundamentals so I'm not completely dumbfounded by what she's explaining to me.

A little background, I am 22, getting ready to start at a community college. I went to the local university when I was 16 (graduated early). I was working full time when I started going to school and dropped out early in the second semester of my freshman year. Now I'm ready to go back. 

I have a very high stress job right now, but one that would let me do homework at work. My job is not adjustable to school schedules (if I was going to school, I would have to miss classes for work). Classes start on August 23, and I'd like to start taking classes then. I have a little vacation scheduled to end on August 19. I'd honestly like to get a mindless job stocking shelves or bagging groceries somewhere. But, the hours could be erratic, it is minimum wage pay, but I'd have a lot more energy to spend on school.

1315,wytchmaker,1501101113,/r/college/comments/6pqwa7/thoughts_on_taking_12_classes_per/,"Hello all, and thanks for reading this. I've posted on this sub a couple times in the past, but to reiterate, here's my current situation..
I dropped out of college when I was 20 (8 years ago), joined the workforce, and have regretted it ever since. Not a day has passed where I've sat content on my idiotic decision those years ago. These days, I am married and have a 4 year old child who will be starting school of her own next month. I own my home and currently work 40+ hours a week. My wife also works full time but does not earn as much as I do, though it's relatively close in comparison. I want to eventually return to school full time to complete a PhD in Physics, which was my original major. As you can imagine, having the said responsibilities makes returning to college seem nearly impossible. I am, however, determined to leave the blue-collar (read: grunt) style workplace and pursue my dreams of becoming a physicist. 
During the last 8 years, I spent 4 in the military, leaving me eligible to use my GI Bill. I live in Kentucky but would like to attend a University in West Virginia - just about 20 miles away, across the state line. My plans are to obtain my BS from this Uni then try for UK, or another, even more pristegious school for grad work. I already have 4 semesters under my belt, but many of the Math and Physics courses I took in the past are a fleeting memory; I would like/need to retake some of those to be up-to-speed when my feet hit the water, so to speak. I am confident in my ability to self-teach college-level Algebra and Trig, but from Calc I and up, I would feel more comfortable simply re-taking those classes. Same goes for Uni Physics. All of my extra-major electives are already out of the way (English, History, etc.). 
I would like to keep my finances as they are now, realistically speaking. I know I will have to pay to attend, but am hoping my GI Bill will cover most of that. What it doesn't, I will pay for out-of-pocket for as long as possible. But, eventually I will have to stop working full-time to focus on school/internships/research/whatever. But until that point, I need some guidance on how much coursework I can actually handle at once while working full time. My prospective college is about a 30 minute drive (one way) from my house..so that's at least an hour of downtime spent driving. Afternoon/evening classes are my best bet, as I usually work from 6am - ~ 2pm, depending. I desperately want to complete my BS and move on with my life &amp; education ASAP, but I know that going full-fledge, balls-deep right away is a guarantee of getting overwhelmed. I want to avoid that at all costs. This is my last chance to do something with my education; I don't want to spend the rest of my life being a delivery driver. 

So, for someone in my shoes, where should I start in terms of workload? 1 class per semester? 2 classes? I know it will take a while, but when I make it to Junior-level courses, I will look at quitting my current job and getting involved with work related to my major. Until then, I have to focus on keeping my mortgage paid. Please give me some guidance.

I don't regret my time at that school, I learned so much about music but I'm just not sure what to do if my passion never takes off. I don't want to work at Guitar Center or something for the rest of my life. I am pursuing working as a composer for video games (my other passion) but so far every opportunity has fallen flat.

Ive dropped out once when I was an anthropology major then went to my local community college where I recieved my degree in computer science; with a suboptimal GPA of 3.9.

I transferred to an expensive private school which I'm still enrolled in but on a leave because of work schedule conflicts (I work full time to take care of my disable mother while going to school.)

I applied to a state college to ease the financial burden college has brought and got accepted (hooray!) Unfortunately the school will not accept me into their engineering program and has given me a transfer GPA of 3.4 instead of my 3.9. I believe its because some classes from when I dropped out calculated as f's whereas the other school did not count them.

I'm at a crossroads. I can continue with computer science at the expensive school part time most likely; or I can attend the state college and change my major. I'm undecided on what I'll change to but it'll most likely be political science, finiance, or accounting. 

I guess I'm asking for some advice on what to do. I still love computer science even if my passion as dwindled a little because of life getting in the way. I always doubt my math background with the major too. I retaught myself algebra while taking precalculus. 

On the other hand a new school and new major could be just what I need (I wasnt fond of the people at the old school) but the school size is very intimidating. And part time means I'll be in college even longer. (Hooray /s.)

I never had to try hard to maintain my GPA in high school, but I wasn't smart enough to do the same in college.  

Long story short I dropped out, attended a trade school, and am now employed by a fortune 500 company making six figures.  Although I'm making descent money, the opportunities for further growth are limited, and entry level jobs in my field are being outsourced to India.  While there's still high demand for experienced professionals, it does affect my sleep.

On top of that most of the EEs at my current company come in with PhDs, so there's no guarantee I would have that upward mobility I'm looking for.

I should have sought some kind of help, but being a naive fresh-out-of-high-schooler, I didn't. 

When I registered for 15 hours of classes at a local college, my financial aid was still pending. The deadline for the payment passed a few weeks into my courses. Being naive (and dealing with a sort of incompetent financial aid department at a sort of crappy college), the deadline came and went and I still didn't have my financial aid in. 

I was told by my professors that I had been dropped from their class rosters, and couldn't attend my classes anymore because I hadn't paid my semester's balance. I thought ""whatever"", because I wasn't very happy at the college I was attending and I didn't like my classes, so I was happy to stop attending, with the intention of transferring to a different college for the following semester. 

Fast forward to the next semester, and I'm trying to get my transfer finalized, and I was told that I had gotten a 0.00 GPA from the college I was transferring out of, because I ""never attended any of my classes or showed up for any finals"" and whatnot. I was shocked, because I had been told that I was dropped from the classes because I hadn't paid for them. 

As a result, I was put on academic probation at my new college. I managed to get good grades at the new college (and I'm much happier there, the staff is very helpful and really seems to care about the students, I love my classes, all around awesome). I've maintained a 3.4~ GPA there for 3 full semesters, making all A's and B's in the 50 credit hours I've completed there. 

However, the 15 hours of ""F""s showing up on my transfer transcript are weighing my GPA down, lowering my overall GPA to about a 2.88.

But I'm planning on applying to grad school, and every 0.01 point on my GPA is crucial to me. 

Do I have any kind of case to appeal to grad counselors about why my overall GPA is lower?

I would like your input on my current situation and advice as to where to go from here. Before I delve deeper into my current situation, I would like to bullet point everything that led up to it academically:

- Started my secondary education at a tech school. Dropped out of the first 2 semesters.
- I eventually got myself together and went back to above-mentioned tech school. I studied there for 4 more semesters and obtained mostly A's and B's while I was there. 
- Transferred to my current home university where I did one semester. I withdrew from one course during that semester because I wanted to change majors and that course was not related to my major. Got A's and B's in the other courses, though(It was at this time I changed my major from Mathematics to German studies)
- Got accepted study for a year-long academic exchange program in Germany offered by my home university. Finished first semester with flying colors. 
- Current Degree GPA is 3.8

The second semester of my exchange program (which is my current situation) is where things start getting rough. In the last two months I started developing severe depression which eventually lead to suicidal tendencies. This severe depression eventually led me to stop going to classes and eventually lead me to not doing anything at all. I would stay in my bed all day everyday. Eventually, I got sick and tired of living like this and finally decided to reach out for help and I've improved alot since then. Unfortunately, I've missed so many classes from my second semester that I know that I'll have to withdraw from all of them.

These classes wouldn't actually have any affect on my expected graduation date. While all of these classes are German language classes, I still wouldn't be able to apply them to my German major because my university only allows so many courses to be transferred back to them and apply to the major and I already met the applicable transfer course limit when I finished my first semester abroad. It will affect my financial aid though and I'm prepared for that already.

My only question is how badly will this affect my chances getting into a master's program? I will graduate with a Bachelor's in the Arts in German Studies, but I have plans to pursue a master's program which relates to learning how to teach English to Speakers of other Languages (TESOL Master's), since teaching is something I want to do as a career and already have experience teaching English through internships. I don't know how Master's programs evaluate withdrawn courses, so I'd like to know if I still have a chance or if I've completely screwed myself over now. Thanks in advance to those that can help.

TL:DR - Have to withdraw from exchange semester abroad because of severe issues with depression that have been solved. How will a full semester of withdrawn courses affect my chances of getting into a master's program?

We rented a room in her brothers house and I got a part time retail job while taking classes.  A few months in I decided that I no longer wanted to be in the Criminal Justice program at all and decided to take a full time job so we could get our own place and I could help support my wife through school.  My wife graduated a few years ago and I've been bouncing between various jobs (Account exec. for local radio, brand ambassador for a major company, Director of Operations for a medium sized vapor company) for a while and have recently, and unfortunately, found myself selling cars to pay the bills after my last job laid me off and filed bankruptcy.  I don't know if it's the accumulation of bouncing around not finding my home or the fact I'm pushing 30, but I decided I'm going to quit my job and go back to school and get a degree in Digital Film and production, build on some existing knowledge as well as learn some discipline by proving to myself I can get a degree. I applied for financial aid (which I will definitely need) and set an appointment to talk to an advisor at the school this morning.  This is when I was informed that 10 years ago I pretty much screwed myself on getting aid.  I dropped 1 class, received a C+ in one , D in another and E in psychology since I just stopped showing up.  Now I have a .9 GPA from a decade ago that is going to eliminate me from a co-op job as well as (from what financial aid at the college said) eliminate me from aid until I pay out of pocket for a year and raise my GPA.  I submitted an appeal to the college but they said it most likely wouldn't help.  I'm 100% committed to going back to school, but seem to be pretty limited on options.

Any advice on how I can reasonably pay for this through loans without completely burying myself in bills while still in school and working part time, or where I can try to get aid from somewhere? Between paying for a MacBook (which I'll need for After Effects/Motion etc) and other school supplies, I'm feeling pretty hopeless about my ambitions.

1) $232 of it was for remaining unpaid classes, so tuition costs

2) 262 of it is what i received in finalancial aid, which covered the class total.

3) is a late fee of 100

However, they claimed i signed only for 500 later on, no big deal that covers my classes. I was trying to be slick anyway,. 

Out of no where today, it says i need to pay back what is listed above. Despite the campus website saying everything was good so far..

* Had a B in the first semester of Alegbra 2 (9th grade) and another B in the second semester.
* Had an A- in the first semester of Pre-Calculus (10th grade) and regular A in the second semester.
* Had a B- in the first semester of AP Calculus AB (11th grade) and A+ the second. Unfortunately got a 2 on the AP test because I spent more time studying for my other AP test :(
* Currently taking AP Statistics (12th grade) and received an A- in my first semester.
* 610 Math score on the New SAT.
* Currently rank 36 out of 574 (top 6%) kids in my high school and have never dropped past rank 55 (top 9%).
* Have an unweighted GPA of 3.6 and weighted GPA of 4.0.

Firstly, check the requirements for admission/graduation yourself. I ended up being placed in a freshman year program at my school, but I found out after my fourth semester that I needed to take an English Class and a Speech class to get into my major. Also do not rely on your advisor to set up your class schedule. Get a course catalog and plan all of that yourself. Secondly, start well. It'll be much easier to maintain your GPA than try to raise it. My first semester GPA was a 3.33, but two terrible semesters dropped my GPA to only a 2.74 after 41 credit hours. I retook some classes and took several over the following summer and raised by GPA to a 3.61 after several semesters of hard work and careful planning. Thirdly, choose your professors and classes carefully. Use rate my professor to find the good professors for each class before signing up.

I have 100 credits, covering pretty much any general education requirement and consisting mainly of political science, history, and English classes since I was originally pursuing a degree in International Studies. I dropped out after going a little crazy my last semester and basically locking myself in my apartment and avoiding everything (which resulted in more problems than just dropping out of school, unfortunately). Two years later, I'm seeing a therapist and (relatively) mentally stable, I have a full-time job that pays well even if I find it sort of soul-crushing, have some money in savings, and I'm ready to finish that degree! I took two classes at a community college this spring while working, and managed to get A's in both, a success for me since I desperately need to raise my GPA at this point.

However, I'm not sure what to do next. According to the career/academic counselors at the community college, there isn't anything else I can really do there, so they recommend transferring to a four-year university. I can't receive an associate's degree from them even though I've met all of the class requirements because I don't meet the residency requirement (would need to take 6 more classes there, and that seems like a waste of money). However, my GPA is too low to transfer to the nearby state university. Even if I did transfer, the admissions counselor there suggested that it would be impossible to complete my International Studies degree there without quitting my job since they don't have online or evening courses. Changing my major wouldn't fare much better, and would require me to pay more and be in school for longer. Both counselors suggested looking into transferring into an online degree program to finish efficiently and have the flexibility to keep working, but they didn't offer any specific recommendations for schools. There aren't any in-state schools here that offer online programs for a Bachelor's degree.

So I'm looking for any advice or guidance on next steps at this point. I feel pretty lost, even after extensive googling. I really want to keep my job because it pays well enough and I need the money, and coming from a low-income family I've been completely supporting myself for the last several years. I'd also like to transfer to a school that would accept as many of the credits that I have as possible. Which online degree programs through reputable schools would accept financial aid (or at least not be oppressively expensive), have a flexible transfer credit policy, and accept admissions on a rolling basis? I know that even with 100 credits, I still likely have another year or two to complete my degree, but I'm looking to finish it in the most efficient way possible while hopefully offsetting the cost by working.

I emailed my prof asked for an extension and that still wasn't enough. Staring at a computer screen while sick was hard to do. I took that exam and my other ones while not feeling well and on a bunch of drugs. My compsci final was worth so much and I did so poorly, my A dropped to a C. I was getting by with a B in Spanish the entire semester but getting sick caused  that to drop to a C+. I'm worried about my Calculus grade... I aced homeowrk and quizzes but my tests were low 70s. I did pretty poorly on one of them and my prof offered to replace our lowest grade with our final exam grade. Since I wasn't in a good state of my mind, I think I did poorly on the final. if worst comes to worst I can retake the class. But I also don't want to get behind and not graduate on time. This whole situation is frustrating because I've had trouble with schoolwork in the past but this semester I finally established study methods and tactics and was doing well until I became sick and bedridden.

I'm declared as an Economics major but honestly this entire past year I've realized how dumb my major is, while still not getting great grades in it (so far Bs/B+s).  I thought I had to be an Econ major to get a job after graduating, and I realize at a great school like this that it isn't true.  I did well in Calc 2 and 3 and I'm realizing I should've probably been a math major - I took a Calc I placement test coming into college and the professor said it was one of the best grades he ever had seen on it.  Still, I feel like I've always just been ok at math and kept getting scared of continuing it (I'm anxiety-prone), so I jus screwed myself by not taking the right classes at the right time.  I was going to minor in it anyway, and I was in some intro to proofs class for this 4-week term we have but dropped it impulsively to get into a French class (I love French too).  


I want to be impressive like the guys I went to high school with, many of whom are doing Engineering, Physics, Math, Comp Sci, etc.  I was never great at science but I could do Math.  My dad was an Econ major but he never really encouraged me to do Econ, he thinks it's pointless too - he thought math would've been better for me.  Since I dropped that class, I'd have to take decent summer loads or stay an extra semester/year to do Math - I don't even know if it'd be worth it.  Another option was to do a Philosophy major and a math minor - I find myself much more engaged in philosophy classes.  I didn't know I even liked philosophy or was good at it until this year.

I tried going to school a couple years ago.  I didn't do too well and ended up dropping out.  After I dropped out, I went to the local community college and got a Commercial Driver's License to drive trucks and buses.  I've done really well with it ever since, getting offered just about every single job that I apply for and making around $20/hour already, plus I really enjoy the work.

The thing I'm worried about is that self-driving trucks are starting to be invented and I could have a lot less job prospects 5-10 years from now.  I really don't want to give up my current career, but if I'm going to have to someday, I would rather be prepared somehow.

Is it a good idea to (at least try) to get an associate's in something to be ready if all the work I can do does become automated?  I really dread the thought of going back and am going to have to drag myself feet first into it but it would be much easier this time around, at least financially, as I could work my way through it (making no less than $15-$20 per hour) and also, I have BOG waiver so I wouldn't be paying anything.

I went to school for 3 years and in that time just gradually dropped my grades due to some mental health issues, and decided to take a gap year to sort myself out. I've decided that I want to change my major. 

I'm still enrolled in my university, but I'm on ""academic leave"" and with my grades, I can't change my major if I come back. As it stands, I think I have to go to a CC and then go back into a 4-year. 

I'm here to ask questions because I tried to contact my transfer advisor and she ignored my emails (yes, really) and I would really like some advice. 

Basically, here are my questions-

1. Since I do have some salvageable classes that would work for general credit, would it be possible to transfer those to my CC when I go, so I don't have to retake the classes that I did well in? I've only heard of transferring the other way around. 

2. How concerned do I have to be about reaching a unit limit? When attending my 4-year I know there was a maximum amount of units you could take during your attendance, but I don't know how this sort of thing works with transfers. 

3. If I show significant academic progress while at the CC, is it possible to make up for my past mistakes? I'm terrified that I won't be accepted into another 4-year after what happened. 

Thank you for any advice you can give. I'll be talking to the staff at the transfer center of my local CC, but I feel like they won't have time to go over things as slowly as I'd like so I want to go in with some prior knowledge.

Since I started college, I've gone through spurts where I desperately want to quit school, pack all my stuff into my car and just drive. Maybe its just my severe wanderlust. But I'd always end up back in school come the next semester. But these past few months, I've lost all motivation to go to class and do my work. I've skipped class more times this semester than I have in in my freshman and sophomore years combined. I dont sleep much because my mind won't shut off. I've been having to force myself to go to class and do assignments. I keep telling myself that I've got one more year left. If I can just push through and finish my degree, I can take some time before I find a job and do all the things I so desperately wish I could do in college. Then I think about how disappointed my parents would be if I quit. I've thought a little about what Id do if I dropped out, but nothings set in stone. 
I think Im at my breaking point. I want so badly to be anywhere other than at school. I'd love some advice. Anything helps. I just need some guidance. ",college,Advice on Potentially Dropping Out,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/63ce5s/advice_on_potentially_dropping_out/,1491303671.0
1368,jungzedd,1491159750,/r/college/comments/631i8c/i_feel_miserable_in_college_and_depressed/,"A friend left me because I hadn't seen her for too long, because I was too busy to hang out with her. I chose the program that I was pursuing for years and neglected human interactions for months. I meant that by saying all I did was go to school and home or vice versa. She told me to check my health and my lifestyle for the past few months that it was becoming unhealthy. That thought didn't cross my mind and totally ignored her worries. I sacrificed everything only to get a high gpa at the end of the month without anyone to talk to during the break.

Second semester started. I was doing well in my classes, but stress began to sip in. I stayed hours and days in my room coding some application, creating websites, and working in some UI's for my assignments. It felt like I was in a CS degree when I am taking an IT program of 2 years. They try to squeeze in everything in two so the lectures were really fast paced. I didn't have time to do a little studying, because I had to do some other assignments that were due later. The due dates were really close to each other that sleeping was loss and sometimes I didn't eat at all for a whole day. 

At one time, I felt something was falling a heavier weight on me and I was unmoved in bed for minutes. I was overwhelmed with the amount of workload that I was getting at that time. It continued like that until the break of the half semester came. We had one week of break, but I had so many things to work on. We were given assignments even during the break. I was so stressed that I didn't care to do my assignments. I wanted to get away even for a while until school started again. I began to care a little about what I do, neglecting my assignments that weren't started or finished. It started with a migraine then I was having a fever 2 weeks ago. I lost my motivation and everything. I didn't care much if I failed or not. I even dropped my web class, because I wasn't learning even I was in class. All I wanted was too have a break and start all over again somewhere, not in the same school of course.

Is this a right thing to do? My parents weren't happy about it either. Even if I worked my ass off during first semester to make them happy, but second semester felt like a slap in the face. I want to stop for a while and come back again. I never had this kind of feeling of a big failure in my entire life and this is a first. I want to think through, while I am not at school. Probably, work first to pay off my loans and then comeback again.

Last semester i dropped out of my math class (precal) because as much as  tried to get into the class i could i would study and study but when it came to the test all my studying suddenly disappeared.My intro to computer science class got an A, other two classes a B. But i just couldn't pass my math class.

Now im in my second semester, and i took math 259 (precal/trig) i thought well maybe i dropped it becuase i did not try hard enough, same thing is happening now at home do my homework with some struggle but i get it done i just took my math second math test on Friday and i got a D. The first one i also got a D. The math does not  stay in my head.

At this rate i am also going to drop this math class, which would be two semesters now that i have dropped it.And so now as much as i love programming, im gonna have to switch majors because i will never be able to pass my math classes unless i drop down and honestly i just dont wanna waste the time on that.

The reason i think i am struggling on math is because i went to a independent studies high school. And honestly the classes are trash hardly any homework and i took not one math test. And i took advantage of that and just cheated on my math classes and now i am paying the consequences in college.

So for that reason i am thinking about switching majors to something that requires less math and that has something to do with computers.I am a full time student and i work only 10 hours a week, but now i am just not encouraged to be a full time student, so im thinking about taking 2 classes next semester and being a full time worker. What do you guys think does what im saying make sense?What path would you guys recommend?Any advice is greatly appreciated (:

Long story short, I am a college freshman who is generally pretty unhappy at my college.  I'm going to Northeastern University, where I am studying marketing.  No matter how much time I spend studying, partying, putting myself out there to expose myself to new groups and different peers, I have an underlying dissatisfaction with the school and its culture and values.  I have always thought myself to be a very happy person who follows his intuition, and I feel as though it has worked out wonderfully for me in the past.
Making the decision to attend here was a decision that I, deep deep down, didn't feel super happy with but it seemed like the 'logical' choice.  It is a great school that looks to prepare students with real work experience via their co-op program.  Students graduate in 5 years with a bachelors degree, however, they leave with a year and a half of real world work experience and the schools co-op connections are incredible.  That being said, I've realized that as great an opportunity this is, I don't know if it's what I want.  I crave an environment that values community and a more traditional college experience, not necessarily the uptight and segregated community that my current school seems to have.  There are plenty of other reasons for my wanting to transfer, money included, but my hesitation remains.
I have always been a person who follows his heart and feelings to the best of his ability, and, again, this has always worked out for me in the past.  That being said, this is a huge, huge decision to base off of a 'feeling'.
Basically, I wanted to ask for those of you who did end up transferring because you felt like at your old college just wasn't a good fit, did it help?
Was it worth following your gut feeling? Are you enjoying/did you enjoy the school you transferred to?
What about for those of you who dropped out of school to pursue something different?

I take welding and I enjoy it but I can't keep my grades up in my other classes. It's not that I don't pay attention, because I do, but it just seems like they're trying to teach us the things our high school teachers couldn't. I can't comprehend lessons (especially math) in my classes. I've tried getting tutoring but they just get annoyed with trying to teach me these things and eventually just start doing the assignments for me. That's why I stopped my tutoring. There's no point in me going just to pass each paper if I'm going to bomb each test. I don't have a rich family and now I'm thousands of dollars in debt. I want out but would need a job where I could actually start paying off my student loans and pay for the essentials like a place to live and food to eat. I can barely pay for that shit with my student loan money! I'll go days without eating because I just can't afford it.

I want to be able to travel and that's why I picked welding as a career choice, but with my poor grades and not having any college staff or officials that will even try and help me on their own without pointing me in the direction of a different office it's impossible to figure out wtf this college shit really is. As far as I'm concerned, college is a trap to get your money and spit ya out just as dumb as you came in. I'm currently taking 16 credit hours this semester but was originally scheduled for 22 but dropped two classes because the college said I had to, then found out I was supposed to have one of those classes transferred and the other one was never even supposed to be dropped. That's what my councilor says anyway, but he even still pointed me into another office to talk to someone that knows just as much as I do. So if by any chance anyone is still reading this I have one basic question. What the actual fuck should I do? Should I keep paying this college and hope I find enough help to actually get through my classes or drop out?

HS graduation didn't feel special, like I didn't even feel exited one bit, just wanted to get it over with. And when UNI first semester started I absolutely hated it. Reason being my mom is dead stuck on me being a doctor (medical practitioner on a doctorate level). She's been telling all our family and friend that I love sciences and all I've ever wanted to be was a doctor. When I applied to colleges I told her that I'm not sure whether i want to engineering or medicine. She said I shouldn't be wasting my time on stupid things such as engineering. My dad's a computer engineer so I thought maybe he'd understand, but we're not exactly on the best of terms (we barely talk to each other in a day). I told him one day when he dropped off at uni for an advising session (this was before I got my car), that I was going to ask the adviser about looking into an engineering career path. My dad said, ""Don't even think about doing something ridiculous like that. You are not capable of high levels of math, you're good at biology, stick to it. Don't do anything stupid."" I remember distinctly him using the words ""not capable"". I was too shocked to break down at the moment and just replied ""okay"". He seemed almost desperate saying that because he never tells me I'm good at anything. Him saying i'm good at biology seemed like a desperate attempt to keep me in the sciences field.  Out of my parents, he always acted like I had a choice in my career, but when it came to it, I never did. My parents are only doing this because they wants what's best for me, my dad especially grew up around poverty so I see why he's afraid I might screw up my education for good. But I also want to say I know what's best for me, but I don't. I don't know where to start, engineering sounds interesting but I don't know if that's what I want at all. I spent my first semester of college not doing anyting. No clubs, no sports, no partying (not my thing anyway), and yet I finished the semester with two D's. I don't want to use the excuse ""i was depressed"" but I was. I felt so damn empty, I'd even avoid driving in general vicinity of my UNI on weekends. I'm doing much better this semester, with my goal just being to get all As. I spoke to my adviser and If my grades are up, I'll be applying to a switch to the UNI's engineering school. It all sounds good, but I'm seriously doubting if I even want to do computer sciences. If I was really passionate/interested about doing computer sciences, I'd be looking into coding etc, learning about it. I do have passions, just not in engineering. I'm very craft oriented, love using my hands. I've created very small, detailed sculptures to larger clay sculptures. I practice drawing anatomy often and spend most of my pocket money on art supplies. I also write short stories in my free time. I've won many awards over the years for my art and writing on a state/district levels. I love crafting, but I want to keep it a hobby. Without being in a scientific or mathematical field, I don't feel useful (this isn't for my parents approval).

Here's what I need help with:
Is there a job out there that I can apply my craft skills (attention to detail, fine motor skills) to real world situations in math or science fields?

Not sure if all of this is relevant but here we go:

I graduated high school in the top 20% of my class in 2010. I was accepted to my dream school out of state and parents told me they'd pay for it. College started well, I began in a STEM major, 3.3 GPA for my first year. A week after getting home for summer break, my parents told me they were getting divorced.

Next year, I went back to original school, was having slight difficulty focusing and doing well in advanced level math courses. I thought it was stress. Finished the semester with a 2.8. Spring semester sophomore year I started falling off the wagon. In hindsight, I likely had ""high functioning"" depression. Parents started putting me in the middle of fights (I'm the oldest). Stopped going to class because of stress and lack of doing excellent in subjects I used to breeze through. I wasn't able to work through it. I sought help from the school and got paranoid when I thought I overheard a counselor talking about me in the hallway before our meeting that I was running late for. I dropped all my courses for the semester and went home without any bad grades.

Junior year, everything collapsed. I completely stopped doing anything other than trying to cheer myself up. Things I continued doing: partying, social events. I tried getting a puppy to work on my depression (maybe not the best choice at the time but 4 years later, he's my entire life). A month later, a major storm decimated my hometown and I spent a lot of time worrying about how my family was doing instead of working on class work. I was almost kicked out of my sorority, and I decided halfway through finals week to drop out completely. I was heart broken.

I decided to transfer to a college in my home state and moved in with my grandmother. Things were going exceedingly well. I was working part time, I loved my classes and I was making friends at the school. I finished this semester with a 3.4.

This school had another ""flagship"" college whose program was much better than that other one. I decided to transfer there in order to put myself closer to my goals of getting the best degree I could. I got in to transfer but not for my ideal program. I had balanced working full time with school full time and finished this semester with a 3.2. I figured I was in.

Unfortunately, I was not accepted to the program I wanted. I had needed a 3.5 because I was a ""transfer"" student. I was devastated. A couple weeks later, I was suspended from work due to not getting the required license needed within the allotted time. I was out of work for 6 weeks. During that time, I was too depressed to get out of bed, I felt defeated and stupid.

I asked my family if they would support me taking a year off of school to treat my depression and go back to school having worked on a recovery plan. They all encouraged me to ""just keep going, you're almost done"" because I had been in school for 4 years. I needed about 40 more credits for my major, if I ever got into it.

I tried ""beating the system"" by taking summer courses while I waited to apply again to the major I wanted. This backfired. I could not shake this failure looming over me. I couldn't focus on any work, and when I did, I was so self conscious about it. I thought people would think I was stupid, I'd never graduate and everyone would laugh at me wondering where I went wrong.

I was let go from my job in September right before the semester began. I continued academic year 2014-2015 with the same results. Failure. Depression. Unable to even get out of bed. My GPA dropped down to a 1.5. The grades were either B+ or higher or Fs. I was put on academic suspension.

I had to wait a year before I went back and took courses on a probationary status over the summer of 2016. In the meantime, I worked my butt off at 2 jobs, knowing I'd need to save up money to go back. I applied to every job I could to get closer to an office job in my industry.

I went back super excited. I loved the course I signed up for, I had gotten an entry level position (although temporary) in an office and was applying daily to permanent positions in my industry. I wound up getting a C in the class because it was group focused, and I carried my group the entire course by doing most, if not all, of the work. This was the point that I decided I didn't even like this school. Why did I even care? I didn't meet the criteria for a probationary re-admission after academic probation.

I attempted researching other colleges I could attend instead that were still in the area or online. I found a college that I was very interested in that had my major, and required a 2.0 Cumulative GPA. I guess I only had a 1.8, and I was rejected. My options were to take 4 years off and do an ""academic bankruptcy"" in which I'd have to start over or raise my GPA. I figured it shouldn't be too hard to raise my GPA, so I enrolled in the local community college. Bonus: maybe I could get my A.S. and it would make me more competitive considering I had then completed something.

Fast forward a couple more months, I am currently in an entry level position in financial services with plenty of room to advance. I love my company. They offer $2,500 per year tuition reimbursement. I am taking 2 courses this semester towards an A.S. at a local community college. They want me to retake courses (24 credits more) that I previously took in order to get my degree (for example: English I, Public Speaking, Management, etc.).

Total credits: 83
I think my GPA is around a 1.7 Cumulative

I have some questions:

1.) Is there any way to appeal the transfer evaluation at the community college? I won't get double credit at a 4-yr school for retaking classes o did well in the first time.

2.) Does it make sense to graduate with the Associates before transferring to a Bachelors program? Or should I try to raise my GPA with the couple courses I'd need to take as prerequisites and then try to transfer again?

3.) Is it even possible to raise my GPA that much considering how many courses I have managed to fail?

4.) Should I even bother trying to get my Bachelor's Degree? I have always dreamed of getting a Bachelors and a Masters, but now I'm thinking maybe it's just not worth it/unachievable given my past mistakes.

I earned my GED a little over a year ago, and immediately started going to a local community college (at age 25).

In between the time I dropped out of high school, and earning my GED however, I met my SO, and we just recently got married after 6 amazing years together.

I'm only a few quarters away from transferring to a four year university now and have a few choices to make.

There's a school ~4 hours north of us, that is ranked top 20 in both of the programs I wish to pursue(Computer Science, and Physics), one of which, even hosts a Nobel Laureate as a professor.

There's another school that's only 30 minutes away that hosts only one of the programs (Computer Science) I wish to pursue, but is still ranked in the top 100 in that program.

I'm currently trying to make the hardest decision I've ever had to make: Do I move 4 hours away from my wife for ~2 years in order to study the two subjects I've always wanted to study, or do I give up on one of those subjects in favor of the safer play.

Neither of these choices really effect my career aspects, but I am scared that I won't ever have the opportunity to study Physics in a setting like this again, and if I pass it up, I might regret it later in life.

Currently I have a little over a year in a good, entry level job, but I can see that there is much more out there with a degree. 

About 2 years ago I attempted to go to a community college for an Associates, but due to some personal issues my grades rapidly dropped and I was no longer eligible for FAFSA assistance, and did not make enough to cover the cost of classes. 

Now, with my current pay, I make enough to cover these costs, but I work ~45 hours a week, with only Sundays and Mondays off. 

Is it outside the realm of possibility to go to school full time with a student loan to sustain me? I have looked around for answers, but there is so much information around it's hard to get a definite idea of the process of doing so or if it is even possible. 

I understand I could work part time somewhere, and would likely do so, but I guess it gets a little overwhelming trying to get everything mapped out to consider even doing this. 

I have tried online classes in the past, and failed miserably at staying focused. I would much prefer to be in a classroom.

I was only a week or two into the semester, decided I hated my major, and dropped all my classes. I had taken out a student loan to cover the semester costs, but since I dropped everything so early, I guess it was somehow sent back and a few weeks later I was sent a check for the $1,600 I owed the school for the semester costs.

I make just enough money to make ends meet and won't have any extra to send the school for probably a long while, but I'd really like to get through my education so I can get out of this rut.

1389,RichHomieLon,1487536249,/r/college/comments/5v09aq/should_i_consider_transferring/,"Trying to make this as short as possible...I have a lot of friends at school and I love pretty much everything about it. I am pretty involved (helped found a new athletics supporters' club last semester, and I get special dibs to conference tournament and March Madness games) and have enjoyed that. I love the chill/laid-back atmosphere, the student culture/body (62% female at a coastal university), the strength of the Cameron School of Business, most of the people I've met, the sports teams, virtually everything.

However, recently one of my big plans (pledging a fraternity) fell apart prematurely and it's caused me to reconsider my place here. Despite being an incredibly extroverted person, I've struggled with social anxiety since my early teens, and the anxiety especially flares up with women. As many friends and acquaintances as I have here, I also apparently have a bit of a ""reputation"". A rep that almost cost me my bid from the fraternity in the first place (though I was eventually dropped for a very different reason) because of what a few girls might've said about me. I can't stand when women think of me negatively and I normally try to do whatever I can to at least prevent disapproval/dislike. I also have just heard rumors that I was ""banned"" from two other fraternities and that some sorority girl had a restraining order against me (which is weird, because if those *were* true then I would've known first). I'm just really questioning a lot of things right now. I've taken the step of getting counseling/therapy for my issues, which I do think will help. I also feel that my parents dropping their silly GPA requirement would help me finally TRULY enjoy being a college student here as well (especially after the frat issue), though I'd still have to discuss that with them.

Definitely beginning to open up to the idea of transferring. I wouldn't go back to my home state (bc fuck New Jersey honestly), but I am interested in Temple and UBuffalo. Going to school in Philly would be an interesting adventure for sure and I know that Temple's Fox School of Business is better, or at least higher-ranked, than Cameron. Currently have a 3.15 GPA as a second semester sophomore (which is far better than my high school GPA) and am close to officially declaring my major. My family has had financial issues for a while that has made it harder to really pay for school, but federal loans (mixed in with a couple of school-specific loans) have helped a lot. A move back to NJ, in addition to seeing many old scars resurface from high school, also would not solve any affordability issues (most NJ publics are almost as expensive as my current school despite not being as good academically, therefore they have a poor ROI value). While it would definitely suck to leave my current university and all my friends/connections behind, I do want to at least float those couple of apps around just to see what would happen. I know that if I do end up leaving, I would much rather have it be on my own terms as opposed to because my parents didn't like that I got a 3.2 as opposed to a 3.5. In the meantime, I will focus on my current class schedule (16 hours of GenEds/electives), my on-campus job in the university library, applying for summer internships, reapplying to be a freshman peer mentor for next semester (had to drop it at the start of last semester), and most importantly using therapy to help solve my problems. I just completed and sent in my school scholarship application last night, hoping to get some money from the general university and/or Cameron.

TL;DR: I love my school, but recent events/rumors have caused self-doubt and social anxiety to set in within the last week and I now am actually considering transferring.

Why is it that I have to take all this filler and stuff that is irrelevant to my major in comp sci? Like I understand some math has a purpose in comp sci but I highly doubt I will ever use integrals or derivatives when I am working samething with this arbitrary 1 year of science requirement that so many of the UCs I am interested in going to require a comp sci major to take and this is not even getting to the other stuff such as humanities which seem totally unrelated to what I am doing.

With all that being said I have went through 2 years at a community college now I have like 6 ws some of them being for classes that are jokes and I couldn't care enough to even do well and just took to fulfill that 12 unit requirement so I can get financial aid and others such as biology and biology lab which should be one W anyway. There are other Ws as well which I have such as in C++ but that was because I was working full time during the summer and the teacher was god awful. He could barely speak english and it was an accelerated course. I dropped 1st semester calc as well that one I have no excuse for however I really don't see the purpose of any of these calc classes in my job prospect anyway so why should I even bother taking them?

I want nothing more than to finish school and after my first major fuck-up, I took time off to prove I was ready to go back. 

My first year at a CC was in 2006 and my grades were decent (mostly B grades, no fails/withdrawals). I left in the middle of my 2nd semester to take care of a dying family member (yes, I should have talked to administration at that very moment, but I left on impulse) and didn't return for almost 2 years. When I came back I was extremely depressed and found myself in an emotionally abusive relationship that obviously didn't help my depressive state of mind. I attempted classes numerous times but always failed out or dropped because I mentally couldn't handle life - as pathetic as that makes me feel. I started considering suicide and that was enough of a mental push for me to leave my relationship. I moved home and started my own business. This is when I took time off school. I returned a year later and was doing swimmingly. Then I was attacked at work by a man with a gun. Needless to say, that fucked me. I left school a short time later because I was having such severe panic attacks and would easily stay awake for over 24hrs at a time because I was convinced someone was trying to get me. I didn't return the next semester and talked to a therapist in that time. She strongly pushed anti-anxiety medications, but I refused. I re-enrolled with all the proper police paperwork in regards to my attack because I was on my final attempt of academic probation and had to petition for admissions. Clearly, I wasn't ready to go back. My Math instructor dropped me today because I didn't attend the last 4 classes due to having panic attacks. I have 2 additional classes I'm enrolled in, but I'm wondering if it's pointless to complete them and to just retry at a new CC after going back to therapy and going on medication (clearly it's something I do need)? 

Originally, I was going to school for a BS in Education. I was volunteering with AmeriCorps and working with a CSU and Peace Corps before leaving to take care of my family member. After that experience, I realized I wanted to be a nurse and not a teacher. I received my nursing assistant certification in the time I was taking a break in preparation for my new educational goals.

Between two separate CCs and 10 years (&lt;-- that number disgusts me), I have about 20 W/F/D grades. More than I have passing grades at this point.

so, did going to school as an art major help you? did it help you get a job in the specific art field you were going for? did you feel like you gained valuable knowledge from it or could you have done so as easily by just doing your own research and practicing?",college,Art majors- did college help you?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5twvdv/art_majors_did_college_help_you/,1487050991.0
1397,hairlikemerida,1487006708,/r/college/comments/5tu5th/should_i_drop_out_or_just_take_a_leave_of_absence/,"I hate college. I don't think I will ever like it. I go to a large university in the city I grew up and live in. I am a commuter and this is my second semester of freshman year. 

I just feel very lost. Sitting in class makes me feel lost and anxious. I've also been battling with ADHD (medicated) and depression (unmedicated) for many years now.

I don't feel right here. I feel like I'm going through the motions. I'm always lost as to what's happening in class and announcements, despite me writing everything from the syllabus into an agenda. Quizzes, tests, and homework seem to come from nowhere and it's like I get emails at the last minute that clue me in.

I don't think I've ever wanted a degree. Like, I've never wanted to actually go to college. It was just the next step, ya know? My dad dropped out of college, but he had a plan. He opened his own business.

I don't really have a plan. I'm just tired of being wishy washy. One day, I'm feeling motivated and I'm like, okay, you got this. Just stay on top of everything. But then I actually go to school and I'm toppled over again. I feel like I'm drowning, or just floating along. And wasting money while I'm at it. I feel incredibly guilty about that.

I don't care about any of my classes, even though I was excited when I picked them out last semester. It's just a dullness in me that says I should care. But I can't actually bring myself to. My boyfriend is getting tired of my constant venting, as am I. But I'm just so miserable.

I haven't made any new friends and between commuting and working around 30 hours a week, I don't have the time or energy to. Sometimes I don't even have the motivation to get out of the car when I get to school. I just stay in the car and watch Netflix and then when the appropriate amount of time has passed, I make my way back home and get ready for work.

And I lie to everyone about it. I didn't tell anyone my GPA from last semester, which was like a 1.27 or something. I'm currently on Academic Warning and if I fail anything this semester, I think I get kicked out. But I don't feel any need to succeed or prove that I can do it.

I don't know how to fix this. I yearn to just fast forward five years into the future. It takes everything in me not to cry during class sometimes because I am just so frustrated.

I am not a stupid person. I love learning and I'm extremely passionate about many things. School has just always been a bad environment for me. I fell into a deep depressive episode during last semester and had fleeting thoughts about suicide (I never would, but it's not a fun thing to think about) and I fear that I am falling back into it. I was fine during break. I switched my major to something I'm interested in. But the minutiae of getting to what I want to be is, what I think, killing me.

1398,abbyc383,1486601318,/r/college/comments/5swtmu/desperately_seeking_insight_from_elite_university/,"Hi, everyone!

I am currently a senior at a very small (around 400 students) public high school in rural Tennessee. I've known from a very early age that I crave the sort of intellectual stimulation and engagement a top-tier university can offer me. As such, I applied to Princeton and Yale, along with Duke, Vanderbilt, and a few other liberal arts schools. Much to my surprise, after applying Early Action, I was accepted to Princeton a few months ago. I am absolutely over the moon, but the news affected me in a lot of unexpected ways. 

I do not come from an even remotely wealthy family, and no one in my family has attended college. Furthermore, while I am grateful for the experiences I've had at my high shool, it does not offer AP classes and the honors classes that are available are large and open to any student who chooses to sign up (my honors English III class was largely spent teaching students how to write a paragraph). In short, my high school career has been devoid of challenge. 

I realize that as I move forward, I will be forced to reflect on myself in order to make the decision of what college to attend. I didn't expect to ever get into an Ivy League university, and now I have to wonder if I am good enough. I feel as though I might very well be grossly underprepared, both because my classes in high school lacked rigor and because I don't believe I know how to study properly. I am terrified by the prospect of attending one of these schools and finding out that I'm not smart enough or that I can't handle the pressure. Even the fact that I would be a southerner from a lower class family dropped into such a wealthy and sophisticated campus environment makes me nervous. I do not in any way want to come off as ungrateful for this opportunity. I am absolutely overwhelmed by how fortunate I am to be offered the chance to study at a school like Princeton. I just want to make an informed and realistic decision.

Undergrad, top 10 public school, political science BA program and stats minor, 124 credit hours, no degree, 1 class short of my degree, 3.0 GPA. I had medical issues and just kinda dropped out. Did not follow standard process. Could get retroactive fixes to grades with my therapist. Would also need to reapply for admissions.

IB Diploma recipient, 36 points 
This provided me with every basic curriculum requirement at my undergrad school except for stats. 

Where I'm at: I have a 5 year IT career but got laid off. Looking at jobs I want, it really looks like I should go get a CS or engineering degree. 

My question is about what are my options here? Does my past college experience ""matter"" in this second education search? 

I would love to attend a top private school but I'm not sure if I'm even eligible. Could I essentially start over and try to transfer from a community college? I could use my IB scores to knock out a bunch of stuff at my local CC. 

Would it be better to just go to my local state school (top 20 for CS and known for engineering)?

I stopped enrolling and took a a couple of years off to find myself and enter the work force.  Completely sober now, but my past is still weighing a burden on me.

So yeah, I scheduled a meeting with an advisor in a couple weeks to discuss my options, but my anxiety is making me want at least some answers right now.

So basically I was a computer science major for those first three horrible semesters, but now at this new community college I'm at, I'm doing a 2 year Computer Information Technology: Computer Programming degree.  I really enjoy it, I took intro to Java and history of computers last semester and aced it, and now I'm in English Comp, Intro to statistics, and Intro to networking, and I'm really starting to enjoy myself and feel better about myself.  

Now my issue lies with this. In order to complete this two year degree I have to have an internship, to have an internship I have to have a 2.5GPA at least.  Once I have the GPA I should have no issues as this school has a really high statistic of getting students internships, including some internships at national labs, and other very cool places.  

One thing I noticed when looking at my transcript is all of my grades are ""TF"" or ""TW"" which I think means temporary, but the classes that I dropped out of I retook, and dropped out again, and because these were at a different community college, some of the classes offered at my current college are different.

I suffered from severe depression and just lost myself these past few years, I was nothing but a shell. Stayed with a mentally abusive girlfriend for almost 2 of those years and just forgot who I was. I technically dropped out after spring semester of 2014. I'm majoring in Biology traditional track at a County College and hopefully going for my bachelor's after that. I left school because there was simply too much going on for me to deal with, family fighting all the time when I got home, money problems to pay rent constantly, my ex-gf and I also fighting and I just gained a boatload of weight and felt like I had nothing to live for.

 The part I'm kicking myself the most about is that that spring semester was one of my best, I only had maybe 3 more classes left after that but I got a D in one class(Chemistry 2 Lecture) and just gave up. I originally was a pretty bad student, after my first year I got a 2.0 and was having trouble keeping up but then I said ""Fuck it, what do I have to lose if I try my hardest and fake it till I make it"" and eventually my grades started to go back up and ended up with a 3.0 my spring semester. That spring semester I was part of the executive staff for the student gov, part of college council, head chair for al clubs in my school and everyone came to me for questions, I felt like I was on top of the world. I was on a scholarship and getting that meant that I would be on academic probation. Then fall semester came around, I started to focus more on my gf at the time because she had mental health issues(abused, problems with physcially abusive mom/ex bf) that she had to deal with and just got scared to apply for fall semester then since I saw all of my friends transferring and I just felt like the biggest failure out of anyone I know. 

    Then spring 15 came around and I still didn't apply again... I stopped emailing my scholarship guy even though he emailed me, I never checked my emails out of fear and severe anxiety didn't bother keeping in touch with him since I was afraid of knowing whether or not I'd lose my scholarship over it. I'm usually that big guy with a big smile always on his face who likes to joke around with his friends and is always ready to help, I didn't want anyone to feel bad for me so I pretty much faked that smile for 2.5 years. I love motivating people and getting them to feel better about themselves, it's one of the few things that truly make me happy. I just couldn't motivate myself to get past that anxiety and depression though, I was stuck.

Fall 15 comes and goes by, then spring 16(finally broke up with my ex) and then finally Fall 16, I think about it and the days for registering comes so I finally gather up the courage to go register for classes on the first day of school but apparently after the first day of classes happen you can't pick them up anymore and you can only drop them( previous policy allowed to pick up classes up to 10 days after classes start) I just had a panic attack and left. I was depressed and anxious for a week, my life was in shambles. 

By this time I'm dating another girl who's 22 extremely supportive, intelligent and very happy and is almost done with her psych degree from a very difficult school. We're both from the east coast and she's going to school in the west, she inspired me so much when she let me visit her at her school and I just got a little spark under my ass. I can't wait around any longer, I want a life with her and I want a life for myself. I need to be successful, I need to be the old me, but the best version of me again. I want to have a family, have a career in medicine and buy my mom a house where she can retire to, take care of my older brother if he ever loses a job or is going through something tough. I feel like a failure right now, at my rock bottom but I needed to get my ass up and go apply for spring 17, I got in contact with my scholarship guy( extremely hesitant to speak to me again) but eventually met with me. I told him everything that was going on and has been nothing but a positive influence to me this whole time and I'm extremely grateful for that. 

My gf is working hard and motivates me to do better too, I decided to finally give it a try again and found out that I'm only 3-4 FUCKING CLASSES AWAY FROM GRADUATING WITH MY ASSOCIATES IN BIO. I was ecstatic, I couldn't believe it so I finally applied. I work full-time so decided to go and take 2 classes(technically 3 with lab) only since I'm moving out this may and needed money still. I finally went back to class this morning for the first time and got destroyed with all of this new information. I have to take genetics and genetics lab as well as chem 2 lecture and it's so much information, I used to be great at bio and remember some stuff but we had to take a quiz to see where we're at and I'm sure I got a 20 on it today. I felt miserable after, disgusted with myself and now I don't know what to do. The professors are awesome but I feel bad bothering them for help, I don't have a car so it's difficult coming to their hours as well. I just needed to share this with someone since I'm terrible at sharing my problems with people out of fear of disappointment and people just leaving me.

Where do I start? I used to be awesome at studying but this is truly scaring me. It's a whole lot of information until my next monday class... Thanks for reading if you managed to get this far.

My life has been hell, I haven't gotten to live like a normal high school kid and I've been suffering from depression and anxiety for 3 years. I've had to repeat grades 2 times. The first time was because my mom dropped classes on purpose to keep me in homeschooling because she didn't want me to attend a public high school. My mom refused to put me in public school because she didn't want me to have a normal life. She wouldn't even enroll me as a homeschooled student so I could participate in athletics in my district. And don't even get me started on my abusive father and the shit he brings to my life on a daily basis. The 2nd was because I didn't care about school and did none of the work. My GPA is so terrible (1.5 GPA). I've averaged a few A's and B's, but they were mostly from electives and summer courses. I have 10 credits.. I can potentially graduate a year from now. I'll have enough credits to be eligible as a senior for next year if I pass all of my classes (currently doing well with a 3.4 GPA the last 2 quarters). I can do a summer course or two that will put me at 16 credits and the rest of my courses I will get when next school year starts I can work ahead and pass those by December of next year. My counselor said she will help me do anything that will help my GPA.

When I graduate I would love to go to college instantly in time for the 2nd semester or Spring so I can try out for the football team, since I couldn't play sports in HS. I know that's another impossible feat but I still want to give it a shot. I fear that even if I work my ass off and get A's and B's for the next year and explain my situation and the steps I've taken to become a better student to colleges I'm applying to I won't be accepted. Would a 19-20-year-old student that repeated twice with bad grades through most of HS be attractive to even one school? Am I better off going to CC? Also, I may potentially be moving out of state with my mom - to somewhere like Arizona. I heard that ""Arizona State lets anyone who breathes in"" but I don't believe that. ASU is a great academic school in its own right, and If I plan to participate in sports I need a 2.3 eligibility GPA and barring overloading myself with all AP classes and straight A's, I won't reach that.

Basically, my whole point is I hate that I messed up high school. My depression and the shit that goes on daily in my personal life is no excuse for my grades being the way they are. Imagine if I had put in the effort to be a great student all the stuff that's happening in my life now would be irrelevant and easier to deal with because I'd be going to college in 8 months from now. Instead, I likely have to spend another year in HS and I fear that any future I have is in complete shambles and can't be repaired. I get so sad and upset seeing kids my age be all excited for college, enjoying their ""lasts"" in high school and having the normal life I pursued to have for so long. Unfortunately, my support system and lack of work ethic failed. Believe me, I'm not trying to make excuses because I'm at fault for where I'm at too, but if you lived in my family and had to deal with the stuff I have to deal with every day, you'd fail some classes and be depressed too. Especially if they're the source of your depression and refuse to change when they see the decisions they're making are clearly affecting you.

So pretty much where do I go from here and how can I overcome all of this? It's gonna take more than ""hard work and improvement"" I feel.

and please don't catgorize me as the guy who uses depression or something as an excuse as to why i didn't exceed. That'd be an insult to people with depression everywhere.

Now I'm Re-Taking those classes and I don't think my 0.0 GPA is going to go up by much but it should right? Also with that, Programs such as a Nursing Program will see that I failed the classes and then re-took them then passed (Hopefully with flying colors) but my overall GPA will take a dip because of that?

Thanks for Reading and letting me know things. 

TL;DR
Failed all classes last quarter, gave up and stopped attending them. Too late to Drop them, never dropped just failed.

1412,drifter265,1483245407,/r/college/comments/5ldk4j/failed_four_quarters_of_university_going_back_for/,"A little backstory:

I dropped out of high school sophomore year. Took a break for a year playing online poker. Got my GED. For two-and-a-half years I worked on my AA transfer degree and graduated with honors and a 3.83 GPA. I then transferred to a good university and my first two quarters there I bombed, switching my majors twice. I contribute this (and more on this later) to depression. I took another year break (or maybe it was two years) and went back to the same university and then did well my first quarter back but then failed the second (or the fourth overall).

I should mention (and this is most important) that at the end of my last quarter I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. This caused most of my depression and the fact that I couldn't focus, couldn't sit still in class, nor be able to do my homework or study. I am now on medication, feel a lot better, and am going back for a fifth time at the same university (after I get reinstated). I'm wondering if there's any chance I'll still be able to even succeed or whether I'm just not cut out enough to be a college graduate? Is having untreated bipolar disorder a good enough reason to be failing this hard?

I want to graduate college more than anything and I feel like finally being medicated is giving me the chance I need to finally do it.

Long story short, last school year my mental health got extremely unbearable and it was the worst it’s ever been, which eventually messed up my academic progress and not only did I lost my scholarship but I was placed on probation. I dropped a bunch of classes bc I wasn’t doing well in them, missed class bc of my depression, and lost a family member. I got an email today saying that I’ll be on probation AGAIN (my 3rd time) for the Spring 2017 semester. When you’re on probation, you’re restricted to only taking 13 credit hours. This is my second year in school and I’m behind, I’ve only earned 29 credit hours. Also, being that I’ve lost my scholarship, I’ve had to take out a private loan from SM  All of this has been extremely stressing and disheartening to deal with. I’m currently registered in 17 credit hours (5 3hr classes, and 2 1hr classes), and I’m finally mentally stable, and my work ethic has improved. I’ve also been getting involved on campus more, and I even have an internship. I honestly cannot afford, figuratively and literally, cannot afford to take 13 hours. This is so annoying, I honestly believe that my university made a mistake calculating my GPA (they’re very unorganized). 
So, what should I do? Should I try to fight to get off probation before the Spring semester begins? Or should I be on probation again, finally get off and stay at this university? 
(taking a semester isn’t an option bc my family isn’t supportive of me and taking a semester off would literally cause my mental health to deteriorate rapidly)

I just finished my third semester here and I have 2 semesters left (I did all of my basics at community college). I was actually suspended after the spring semester because my overall GPA dropped to a 1.2.. Long story short I had a lot of issues going on and the school accepted my appeal to let me stay in the school. I was put on probation and told to make a 2.5 this semester or they would take away my financial aid.

I can own up to my mistakes, and if I can't appeal my grades, I will accept that I am kicked out.. I just don't know what to do. This is not a case of being too young for school. I can't take time to go to a community college because that's where all of my credits are from! I have no more classes to take there. I have student loan debt that requires me to make payments 6 months after I stop going to school... I'm just so lost.

I dropped out of high school the end of my sophomore year. Took a two year break (doing what exactly?) and got my GED. Immediately after I started community college and after two-and-a-half years of working on my AA, I got a transfer degree and a 3.83 GPA. I was really proud of myself. I then transferred to a university and everything went downhill from there.

I failed my first quarter (withdrew from two classes and got a C in the other) and then bombed my next quarter as well. I then dropped out and took about another two year break. I came back (it's been exactly a year now) and got two A's and a C and was on track to graduating. Then the next quarter I got a crush on a girl and some terrible things happened that ended up with me getting hospitalized in a mental institution and failed that quarter as well with two D's and a B. I then got expelled from the university for my 1.8 GPA. Suffice it to say, I'm pretty damn disappointed in myself.

I figured out a way to then get back into university (because screw getting a real job) and I discovered that to get reinstated you have to take four classes at a community college and get a 3.3 GPA or better, which is what I'm doing this January. Once I finish that (if I do) I'm going to go back to university and hope to do better this and finish my degree.

I should also mention that during my hospitalization I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and discovered that the reason for most of my failing at university was because of some major depression. I've read and learned that this is a viable excuse for someone wouldn't be able to do well at university. Now that I'm properly medicated (after years of taking failed antidepressants), I feel I am in a much better mood to tackle university this time.

About the rich aunt. I was never in my lifetime expecting her to help me out like this. So I felt extra hopeless and decided to let myself fuck up my life at this crappy local commuter school I go to because I never imagined I was going to get the opportunity to go to a prestigious private grad school, potentially.

So. I have this shitty GPA. BUT. I have been in a research trio and our original research has been published by 3 science publications. (I'm a Geography major btw). I just completed another group research project again original research and perhaps our professor can help us get published. Along with that, I know I can get multiple glowing letters of recommendation from past and present professors and mentors.

I failed every. single. class. 

I took a year off, then I retook my classes again, and failed. AGAIN.

Since then I spent about two years working in restaurants, going to therapy and what not.  More tragic things happened in my life, and me getting bullied in high school (which was what made me drop out in the first place) caught up with me and I developed Agoraphobia which caused me to lose my job and move in with my parents several states away.  Since then I was able to overcome my agoraphobia, I finally have a positive outlook on life, and I've picked up programming as my favorite hobby.  

I now feel ready to go back and try college again.  I'm doing a 2 year degree at a new community college.  A computer programming degree. I'll be taking 3 classes, Intro to programming &amp; logic, Programming I lab and the coreq for Programming lab, which is just a lecture.

The schools I was looking at are UC Berkeley, UCLA, and UC Santa Barbara. I plan to be a math major, either computer science or something similar like engineering. 

I've done a lot of research and I see the work required to transfer out of state is ridiculous. I have to establish residency, sign forms to say that I plan to live in CA permanently (wouldnt mind) and that I still may be under non resident status by the time I graduated. 

To add even more to it, these schools say they will not tell you over the phone what courses out of state will transfer. They recommend basic level courses, but if I wanted a concrete definition of what they will and will not take, I have to go to the schools in person.

I am so close to getting the AS in IT, my original plan was to tough it out somehow... Get the degree, then transfer to a BA Nursing school.

Should I switch at my current school, the only other things I could switch to is an AS in Biology, or Pre-Nursing... However the pre nursing degree appears useless for anything besides joining a BA nursing program. If I got the pre nursing degree, I would hate myself, because i could have a AS in Nursing from another school instead, and be making 30/hr starting out.

1430,Hiromin,1480681483,/r/college/comments/5g2zlj/would_taking_a_gap_year_affect_badly_my_chances/,"Hello (again) everyone.

I’m an international student interested in studying CS (Bachelor’s) at a US university.

I’m actually a 3rd year medical student. However, I’ve been considering dropping out for quite a long time now. Long story short, it is simply not what I wanna do for a living and was only doing it up till now because of parental pressure, which is also why I want to study CS abroad and change my path in life this drastically.

As it’s still a whole year before the next admission deadlines (it’s too late to apply this year), I was thinking of having a gap year. Tbh, I want to drop out whether I would have a gap year or study something else immediately, I just want to get out of med school as soon as possible. The problem is that my parents oppose the idea, and want me to finish those 2 years of med school before applying elsewhere. At first they refused to even consider the possibility of me being something other than a doctor, but after 4 months of me trying to convince them, they at least changed their mind to this. But still, I don’t want to study 2 more years either. I will drop out either way, sooner or later, so I see no reason as to why I’d have to wait. I’m just postponing my dreams in vain that way. I’m just wasting my time and effort on something I hate.

Therefore, I wanna drop out as soon as possible. During this gap year, I will be focusing on studying for the SAT (It’s been nearly 3 years since I last had a course in math or physics, so I need to refresh my memory at least), and writing my essays and preparing my application requirements, but also I’ll continue learning C++ that I started a while ago, and finally I’ll do some side projects to improve my “achievements”. Currently my parents aren’t even allowing me to do any of this, so for a couple of months I’ve been doing it in secret, but that’s been stressing and I couldn’t really focus *that well* on any task as I couldn’t afford spend more than 10 min on it each time (sometimes I have to divide an exercice on three to even finish it, and that reduces my focus and I have to remember where I stopped last time to continue). This is because I was doing that in secret from my parents while I’m supposed to be studying my med courses, or on the way home, or during my short break, so I am constantly stressed and on my guard out of fear of them seeing me (whenever they pass in front of my room or look at my phone) and finding out, which really decreases my concentration ability even more. The lack of a set hour and amout of time, made it so that the result isn’t that consistant.

So instead, I’ll take the opportunity of the gap year to do all of this and take my time on each task and be organised with a consistant timetable.

However, I’m concerned that a gap year would be seen negatively by the admission officers. They might think it is a sign that I can’t handle the amount of work in college, or that I am not fit to be in a competitive university as I “dropped out” of med school. Plus, I already had two exams this year, so if I drop out now, I’ll get 0s in all of the rest. So when they see my college transcripts they might think I failed even (well I technically did, but that would be because I didn’t even take the exams). If not for this concern, I would have dropped out a while ago already. The only thing still stopping me from doing what I want and opposing my parents is this. So, please, what do you think? Would a gap year and all of those future 0s reduce my chances of admission to the top schools?

My parents love me and work hard to support us and all I do is screw everything over in college. 

I started college 1 years ago with a 3.4 Gpa and HOPE scholarship. I'm 18 and still a freshman with just 13 total hours. I  failed all 3 of my classes this semester and my GPA dropped to a 1.54.

I feel like I am not going anywhere in college and don't know what I want to major in so I majored in cs but I struggled so much in math. I spent 5hours a day studying notes and practicing math problems over and over. I go to math tutoring center and i still struggle on math assignment and failed multiple math courses multiplie times.

I have a lot of depression through my life due to a lot bullying and have no friends and never interacted with people from elementary school to now since I struggle with interacting with people outside of home.
 Evertime i fail a class i think of suicide majority of the time since I feel like I fuck up all my opportunities 

 I have no HOPE or financial aid since it got denied in the summer and my parents had to pay out of pocket for this semester. Now I have no way for paying for school since my parents have to focus on bills and I can't take any loans due to my academic grades.

I have been really depressed as the school year dragged on by and just play video games to escape my life struggles and it helps me forget all my problems. 

My dad says I am going to fail if I keep it up and I wont be living home if i do and i know he is right and I feel guilty not telling them how my college is going. He won't be able to pay for it because he has to pay bills and supply for my siblings and I.

At this point I feel like suicide is the only option at this point. I'm lost and I don't know what to do and I have no one to guide me.

My mom loves me so much and I don't want to make her suffer if i commit suicide but it's really tempting at this point since I feel like a disappointment and I might as well do it before I actually turn into a failure but  I am scared to do it at the same time.

I had a tough time this year. I truly believe I was depressed Spring 2016. I'm having a hard time getting through remedial math(i absolutely suck). i only have 9 credits and i've been in school since fall 2015. 
I seriously feel like such a failure and i let all of my emotions get to me if i can't figure something out. This reason i only have 9 is because my remedial math has taken up a spot, and i've dropped a few classes on the way so i'd prevent getting a F and making my gpa even worse. 

Recently i've found that i'm interested in Diagnostic Imagery, and it's made me somewhat positive and looking forward to things. But i'm trying so hard to hang out to it. 

I really don't know how or if i can catch up in the next year. I don't know if i should focus on getting up to college level math, or taking some of the easier classes(elective credits) on top of my core classes and just busting my ass to catch up. I don't want to have to drop my math class bc then i'll be even further behind with that, but i'm so stuck on catching up at this point.

I've kind of gone all over the board with what I wanted to study, as I don't have to declare a major until February. I decided to go along the path of an Econ major and then wanted to do an Econ/Math double, but I've since dropped the math (in Multivariable now) because I just didn't want to spend my time in math classes that weren't really interesting me. I like Econ, don't get me wrong, but I got a B+ in both intro Micro and Macro and it's not like I have a burning passion for the subject.

Anyway, I am in a Philosophy of Politics class now and I can't believe I never took any philosophy before, because I find it really captivating - maybe it's in part because my professor is awesome, but he said I am good at connecting the different concepts across the thinkers we've studied. I find I like the philosophy part of the class more than the politics part so I'd definitely go in that direction.

I am trying to decide if I want to do an Econ-Philosophy double major or not. I could definitely pull it off but I would probably have very little room to take anything else elective-wise, since I took up philosophy late. I am definitely considering getting an MBA down the road in a couple years, although I don't know exactly what field in business I'd like to go into. For some reason being solely an Economics major is unappealing to me. I feel like having Philosophy in there would make me stand out in the future. My career counselor also said that being even a sole Philosophy major would make me stand out to employers, although I'd have to work harder to get my foot in the door for that first job.

The idea of being just a philosophy major is becoming a bit more appealing, especially because I found a guy who works with my dad who was a Geography major and has been very successful. But I realize many people would laugh in my face upon hearing that I was just a philosophy major.

This is what I've been doing for the last 2.5 years and turned 22 today. 


I had lots of doubts about if it was what I wanted to do and the longer I went the more I felt like I was missing out on my chance to go to college and enjoy it. Largely though, I didn't know what I wanted to do so I just stuck with it. Well, recently I've looked into enough things and done enough job shadows that I figured out I would really enjoy being in management and working in the energy sector.

Lots of people I work with went to school and struggled to find any decent jobs after graduating and got stuck with a bunch of debt and tell me I'm really lucky to be where I am and if I go to college it will just set me back.

I've been going to community college for 4 years. Except I made the giant mistake of dropping out in the middle of a semester last year for a multitude of reasons. The stress of working full time and going to school, the school's counselors were almost impossible to see, they were never very helpful, the tutoring system sucked, my teachers were pretty bad, so I was stupid and dropped out. And that turned into skipping another semester and just working. 

I was planning on taking a summer class at a different college but I ended up on the waitlist and the professor decided to pick people on the waitlist randomly out of a hat. So I never got that class and had to skip yet another semester.

Then fall semester comes and my registration date is terrible. All of the classes I needed (Calculus, Chemistry, etc) were all completely full by the time it was my date to register. Which is to be expected because the classes I need are the first ones to go. 

So I've been trying to figure out what the hell I can do to just get those classes so I can finally transfer and dedicate myself to my major.

I went to see a counselor to ask for a better registration date but I knew it was to good to be true. Obviously the system can't allow that. The counselor said to email professors and basically beg to be in their class, that's pretty much my only option. 

I would take online classes somewhere if I could, but I haven't found any places that offer just calculus, chemistry, and physics classes. 

I've tried everything I could and I can't afford to just take a semester of random classes I don't need just to get a better registration date for the NEXT semester. I've tried talking and asking so many people what I could do, and all I get is, ""well that sucks."" 

Is my only option begging professors and hoping they'll let me in their class? Or is this just karma biting me in the ass and screwing me over? It's crazy how stressful this is for me. I'm kinda losing hope for my future simply cause I can't get myself into any classes.

I'm 21 and in my 4th year of university. I'm in a business degree. However, last year I added a CS major too. 

My parents are mad. I've dropped 4 classes since adding the CS major, the workload is overwhelming doing both of these degrees. They say I'm wasting money, and I should have tried to finish the courses with Ds. My cumulative GPA is about 3.4/4, and I'd like to keep grad school as an option in the future. I felt like Ws are better than Ds, if I'm better prepared for next time.

- The first 2.5 years of school, I took a full course load while working part time and finding an internship one summer.
- After this time, I started trying to work towards a CS major too. I resigned from my job, I knew it was going to be tough to do a double major:

Jan-Apr, 2016: 5 courses enrolled, 3 passed (2 business Ws)

May-August, 2016: 3 CS courses passed

Sept-Dec, 2016: 5 courses enrolled, I'm going to pass 3 (2 CS Ws)

I got great marks in everything that I've done so far, but 4 Ws are horrible. :[

----

I feel like crap about this, but I think it's better to drop instead of barely holding onto a passing D through the term. I didn't feel like I had as much time as I thought I would, and I'm not sure where to go from here. Here's what I got so far:

- Next term, I plan on taking 4 courses instead of 5 (retaking two of the Ws), and then I'll be done the original degree minus two electives. The prof is horrible though, but he's the only one who teaches these courses (he's just extremely difficult).

- I'll need 2 electives to graduate, so I thought I'd take 2 CS courses in summer term (retaking one W) to finish the degree with a minor in CS. The summer professor is MUCH better than the one I have currently, and I can work on finding a job while finishing up the degree.

- I'll figure out what I want to do after that. I'll have 10 more courses to go for a general CS degree, if I want to finish the second major.

---

I don't feel like my dad will understand. I've offered to pay for summer, since he told me that he'll pay for 4 years of school and that's it. Which is fine with me... but he's disappointed that I'm wasting money.

Trig has been this overwhelming cloud of terror above me for the longest time. I managed to weasel out of taking it in high school, and I really regret that, but I would have just failed it then.

This is my second semester taking trig. The first one was a total fluke. I signed up for an online course, 2 weeks in and work just got so busy I had to withdraw. Realized online math would not be my style. Counted as a W on my transcript, so strike one.

This second go-around started off alright, but I've slowly dropped down to a mid C range. If I don't do super fantastic on this final I have coming, I'm probably getting a D.... so that would be strike 2.

--My eventual goal is to become an entrepreneur. I see myself working as the builder of the machine rather than a part of it.

I'm in a community college and was planning to transfer after two years to save some money. Things went well and realized I could transfer at the end of my freshman year (I'm a first-semester freshman now). Although, I realized I needed to make a tough decision.

I'm a Pure Mathematics major currently enrolled in Calculus III and was enrolled in an Intro to C/C++ course. When I found out I could leave earlier, I wanted to get as much mathematics as I could under my belt to make my transcript look better. My school only had two other math classes I wouldn't be able to take because I'd leave early (not including DiffEQ's that I'm taking next semester), Discrete Structures I and II, which run in Fall and Spring, respectively.

I wanted to take both classes before I go so I tried to schedule it in but it didn't work because Discrete Structures I overlapped with my C/C++ class. You can see where this is going. I had an A on every assignment in the C/C++ class and felt as if it wasn't ever that challenging, so I dropped it for Discrete Structures I (also so I could enroll in DS II the next semester). I was past the transfer deadline, so I now have a W on my transcript.

Here's I guess the ""good news"". When I transferred into Discrete Structures it was 1/4 into the semester, so I had to study and take 5 quizzes in a row in a matter of one week, which I all aced, so maybe that could demonstrate to colleges some kind of determination to succeed? Also, I talked to the professor whose class I dropped and he even let me go into a higher level computer science class next semester (his class was the prerequisite for a Java class), so maybe that would help as well?

Not stellar, but with the classes I had, I was happy with it. My fall semester of my sophomore year, I was working full-time and overslept a lot of my classes (didn't get off work until 1:30 a.m. most days). Oversleeping classes and not having time to study led me to struggle in my classes. I should have either cut back hours at work, or dropped my classes so I could get more money to pay for school. Consequently, I failed every class because I was too proud to ""quit"". 

I took the following semester off to work and think about life. I saved up enough money that I wouldn't have to work as much when I returned, and I felt pretty confident that if I get a degree, I will be a high school physics teacher. Also, I plan on retaking the classes I failed because my school ""replaces"" your G.P.A. if you retake a class, but the F's will still be on my transcript. I am not worried about the F's because if I do well in the classes the 2nd time and explain to future employers what happened; the F's should not be the end of the world.

Fast forward to present day, I'm retaking my classes and over 1/2 through the semester. I feel confident in 3 of my 4 classes, but the last class is the worrisome part. I do not think I will pass my Multivariable Calculus course. My school has a policy that if you fail a class twice, you can not retake it. However, being a physics major, Multivariable Calc is an essential class to my major.

Also, I dropped Linear Algebra and Differential Equations (essential class) my freshman year, because I was not going to pass. I have yet to retake that class.

So, here is where I need advice:

1. Do I drop Calc and retake it next semester to try passing it? If I do this, it will be my third time taking the class. If I have to take a class 3 times just to pass it, and I'm not stellar in my other classes, I fear future classes will give me more trouble. I can't justify continuing paying ridiculous amounts of money if I'm just going to retake classes and/or not succeed.

2. Drop Calc, finish my semester in other classes, take my next semester classes, and then take retake Calc at a CC over the summer to get the credits?

3. Or is this a wake up call that maybe my major is too difficult for me? If that is the case, I don't think I should be in college because I truly don't want to study anything else. If I do any profession besides high school teaching, it will be a profession that doesn't require a degree.

4. Just work and live life for awhile. Pursue hobbies, volunteer, try to start a career without a degree. Worst case scenario, I go back to school down the line? I'm financially stable and the money I make when full-time is more than enough for a single person my age to thrive.

or 5. Any advice you guys can think of.

TL;Dr: I might fail an essential class to my major twice. This will make me un-elligable to graduate with said major. I'm extremely struggling in other classes. I'm un-willing to study anything other than my major. Advice?

1445,leeaboo,1478151528,/r/college/comments/5av36j/thinking_of_changing_my_majors_and_im_terrified/,"Hi Reddit, I'm currently a third year undergraduate student. I have a year + 2 semesters left to go in my current program (double major in Anthropology and English).

I've been having a difficult semester - I'm full of anxiety about my job prospects as I don't want to go into teaching. I originally wanted to go into law or getting my MPA, but my grades have dropped this semester despite me trying my hardest, talking to my professors to get advice, etc. I currently have a B+ average, which is the bare minimum for grad school (so not necessarily competitive). I don't want to set myself up for failure if I can't get into grad school as I'm unsure how else I can make a living wage with my degrees. I am also having a difficult time with not doing as well as I hoped I could despite putting in 110%. This has slowly drained the passion from my studies. I didn't ever plan on doing field school, either, as I have to work to keep myself in school. This gives me a disadvantage as far as anthropology goes.
I was looking into becoming a registered dietician. To do this, i would need to change schools (my current school doesn't offer the program) and faculties, as I have no science or math prereqs. I hope to be able to do some courses next semester and transfer credits, but I'd still be looking at another 4-5 years of schooling, which is expensive (and terrifying). I am currently debt-free thanks to scholarships and am unsure as to how I feel about taking out student loans. I am also worried about being behind my peers are not entering the ""real"" workforce until I'm 26(ish). I'm also unsure if I would be accepted into dietary school. The general process is to first enter as a nutrition B.Sc. and carry on from there.

To add on why dietary school, I took a nutrition class last year as an elective and it really changed my life. I've lost over 60 pounds from making positive changes to my diet. I like working with people and the medical field (I've done a few internships in vet offices) but do not enjoy being exposed to bodily fluids as intimately as a nurse would be.

I just don't know what to do. I like biology but am unsure if I've just started to hate what I'm doing in school right now because I feel so defeated. I don't want to set myself up for failure by following a dumb path. I am currently a scholarship student but if I keep my B+ / A - (hopeful) average, I won't meet minimum scholarship requirements anyway. It also feels kinda silly to start from the beginning when I only have 4 semesters left.

I even got frustrated towards some people that were simply trying to give me advice and I apologize for that. If you don't know my situation, allow me to quickly explain.

I'm an 18-year-old high school student that is supposed to be graduating this year. My life has been hell on earth, I haven't gotten to live like a normal high school kid and I've been suffering from depression and anxiety for 3 years. I've had to repeat grades 2 times. The first time was because my mom dropped classes on purpose to keep me in homeschooling because she didn't want me to attend a public high school. The 2nd was because I didn't care about school and did none of the work. My GPA is embarrassing (1.3 GPA). I've averaged a few A's and B's, but they were mostly from electives and summer courses. I have 9.5 credits (will have 11.5 by end of this year). I can potentially graduate a year from now. I'll have enough credits to be eligible as a senior for next year if I pass all of my classes (+ the new ones i will have after I get the 11.5 credits) this year. I can do a summer course or two that will put me at 16.5 or 17 credits and the rest of my courses I will get when next school year starts I can work ahead and pass those by December of next year. My counselor said he will help me do anything that will help my GPA.

When I graduate I would love to go to college instantly in time for the 2nd semester or Spring so I can try out for the football team. I fear that even if I work my ass off and get A's and B's for the next year  and explain my situation and the steps I've taken to become a better student to colleges I'm applying to I won't be accepted. Would a 19-year-old student that repeated twice with bad grades through most of high school be attractive to even one school? Am I better off going to CC? 

So I know all about making the most of the rest of my time in HS, doing well on the ACT, doing better in class, all that shit but what steps can I truly take to get a college to take a chance on me if I manage to improve my GPA by next year? I need to finish high school and go to college, it's my only chance of finding happiness and succeeding. I can't take living with my family anymore.

1448,BenchP,1477388261,/r/college/comments/59a5t4/doing_very_poorly_in_my_last_year_ish_of_college/,"Long post ahead but honestly i'm so lost and i really need help.

I'm a biology major who was a pre-med initially for my parents but at a certain point my hate for biology outweighed my fear to confront them. I decided to finish my biology degree because I'm almost done and do a masters in Biomedical Engineering because thats what i always wanted to do and i love math/coding. I have two problems, one immediate and one long term

The past winter semester i took 3 bios and got C's in all of them. The summer i tried taking a bio and a math i need for BME and i failed both. Now we get to this semester.

I took two bio's and the same math. Dropped one bio in the first week. I missed the first math exam which i thought was fine but then i looked at my syllabus and realized i didn't have a drop so if my professor didn't give me a break i was going to fail the class so i decided to start catching up in the class first then i'd go talk to the professor. But catching up took longer than i thought because i also had to catch up with the other bio class which the first exam i bombed. 

So i didn't talk to the professor and i didn't do my homework or quizzes which are 20% of my grade (but i can still salvage at least 10% with the rest of the assignments of the semester). 

Now for this bio class. So including this class, i have 5 bio classes left to graduate, about 18 credits. I've attended zero of my workshop classes, losing 60 points out of 150, and i need 90 points in the workshop to pass the class regardless of my grades in the rest of it. I have an exam today that i'm really ill prepared for and my drop was already used on my first exam. 405/570 points is failing in the class, and i have only 485/570 points (between a final report, quizzes, 2 exams, and a final) left for me to obtain. Even if i got all those points though, if i get less than 90 in the workshop (which im literally at 90 rn) i fail the whole class.

I feel like there's hope for the math class if i just talk to the professor, but i don't know what to do about the bio class. Should i just withdraw and try to fix my garbage study habits? I'm paying for about $4500 of the semester out of pocket. I already threw away some of that money by dropping the first bio. 

****So that's the immediate issue.**** 

   The bigger problem is that this has been a trend over the last 4 semesters. This is the first semester where it got this bad. But last few semesters i've been dropping classes here and there. Doing poorly. Passing just barely. And every semester i tell myself i'm going to go to class. I'm going to attend. But i just don't. I might attend class for a week then i'll flake for another like 3 weeks. I don't know what's wrong with me. I'll miss one class. Then i'll say ok i just need to catch up on that class. I'll go to study and i cannot focus i can't keep my mind on task. 

With my calc class it was easier to study because i love math, but getting behind in bio took me away from it. With my bio classes i literally have to force myself to look at the page. Like i have to consciously in my mind tell myself ""Look at the page, look at the page, dont stop reading."" If i stop telling myself to focus i'll wander off and get distracted. And just getting myself to focus is a fight it's like i'm battling with myself to just study. I tried pomorodo method before and that will work for a few days but then i go back to my normal cycle. Part of the issue is that i've struggled with depression and anxiety over the last two years. Recently the depression is slowly fading but the anxiety is still there and its caused by my doing poorly in school and spending even longer in university because i keep dropping classes. My anxiety causes me to not want to do anything but its caused by my not doing anything:(

I feel my biggest issue with this is simply that i don't go to class. I've always been one of those idiot ""smart but lazy"" kids, which i know sounds very childish and means nothing.  However if i sit in class and focus i usually don't have to study much outside of class. I can understand and absorb most information just from taking good notes in class and paying attention, with exceptions of course. My problem is every single semester i start off strong and almost immediately like 1 or 2 weeks in the semester i fall behind in all my classes. And the game of catch up always snowballs out of control until im right here 2/3 into the semester failing my classes anxiety levels through the roof.

Like right now, i know what i need to do to do well. I'm very motivated to finding solutions and i'll probably work really hard at the moment. But once next semester hits i'm scared:(. I feel so hopeless. I've been doing the same song and dance for the past 2 years nothing has changed. What gets me even more angry is that i have a job that requires me to be learning and growing and gaining new skills and i'm doing phenomenal in that job. I honestly thought i was stupid and worthless because of my classes. But here in this job i'm excelling unbelievably. I keep telling myself that it's just because im doing biology which i hate with every fiber of my life. But even so i still have 18 credits of bio classes i have to grind through, i need a solution.

**TL;DR I'm a very bad student currently failing his classes. I need help figuring out what to do about these classes but on a larger scale figuring out how to break out of this cycle of regret, resolution, hard work for two weeks, flake for 3 weeks, cram and try to catch up, then regret again. My biggest issues are not going to class and not being able to focus when i need to study**

edit: also i have a lot of college credits because i went to a crappy religious private school that graduated me at 16 and sent my to a community college where i basically had to finish up the rest of my education then transfer to university. In the process i took a lot of classes i didn't need and had to take a lot of classes just to finish the pre-reqs to start working on actual degree classes.

Now I know I am ready. Problem is high school me didn't care about anything so I was in the 3rd quartile and my SAT score was pretty low like 990. I took it one time. didn't study for it or even try to be honest. 

My GPA in college was fairly good I made the dean's list both semesters. But i talked to the university and I have to retake my SAT and get 1180 on the SAT. 

I don't know if I should try to buckle down and retake the SAT. I would have to really study and relearn everything especially the math. or I could try going to my local community college of a couple years. 

my only reluctance with the community college is I have to work 40 hours a week and I have my own place and bills. The nearest school is 20 minutes away. and they don't really have a good online program. The university has a really good online program. My only plus for the community college really is I've heard most classes are really easy so i think it would be an easier transition.

Second year came and due to circumstances I don't like to talk about, I became severely depressed to the point that a counselor suggested I go on suicide watch. I missed class almost every day.

1453,Arrow_Riddari,1476397979,/r/college/comments/57d49o/tips_for_college_students_especially_new_ones/,"Okay, so you have just been applied to some awesome university. However, you have no clue what to expect. This is meant to be a few tips for college.

**1. Utilize your resources. It will help you in the long run.** Obviously, on campus tutoring is an amazing thing, especially if the tutor took the same professor as you [and especially if your professor isn't very good]. Also, utilize Amazon Prime or form a Chegg account. When I first found out about Chegg, I was skeptical with the idea of renting a book. However, Chegg's online features is very useful [you can rent the textbook online, get instant access, and set how long you want to keep it].

**2. Don't skip class, unless absolutely necessary.** Obviously, this has been repeated over and over. However, skipping class becomes repetitive. Honestly, you can stay home and play games. However, you will eventually start to skip class all the time. Your grade will drop. Try to head to class [even if you have to go late].

**3. If your professor does not teach well, still attend his/her class. However, utilize class time effectively.** Some professors will read word-for-word off the Powerpoint lectures. Honestly, you will feel like your are wasting time. You will ask yourself 'why am I here'. Utilize this time. If you have homework for another class, do it. You have a test coming up, just study.

**4. Be polite to your professors [even if they make a mistake] and call them by their proper title.** Be polite. You may need references and recommendations. If you were rude, your professor will not like you and may give a negative recommendation. Also, if your professor has a PhD, call them doctor. While most professors will not care, some are very particular about being called doctor and WILL get angry.

**5. Actually try to sharpen up your study skills.** Going from high school to college is tough. Going from ridiculously easy community college to regular colleges is even more tough. You will have study skills of oh read the book, do the review, ace the test. That does not work in college. Actually taking notes is the something that you must do. The review is a tool, but professors will still slip in things that are not on the review.


Adding some more tips.

**6. Know the difference between a bad professor, a good professor, an easy professor, and a hard professor.** This is important because a hard professor CAN be a good professor. An easy professor can be a terrible professor. A bad professor is usually someone who reads off the Powerpoint and does not give thorough instructions about assignments. It is hard to figure out what they exactly want from you and these professors tend to be very unhelpful when it comes down to asking questions. A good professor is the opposite- one who ACTUALLY teaches and gives instructions on assignments [especially large projects]. You know exactly what they want and they are helpful when it comes to asking questions. However, on some occasions, their exams can be tricky as they want you to actually apply what you learn in class.
An easy professor has very easily, basic tests. You do not have to do much work for their assignments and it is simply a matter of memorization. Some easy professors' tests may be an exact copy of the review, with different numbers. A hard professor requires more thinking and work in their class. Their classes can help bring forth good study habits.
Obviously, an easy professor means an easy A. However, you may not want that all the time. Let's take the fact that you are studying to be an accountant. You go to an intro to accounting class and the class is easy. You can bring in a formula sheet to the test and the test is basically a copied-and-pasted review sheet. However, you later go to advanced accounting and it is MUCH more difficult. You realize that you barely learned anything in your intro class and will struggle with the advanced class.
Now, for elective courses and for CORE classes that are university required, but do not pertain to your major, find easy professors. Like if you are an accounting student and need to take a science course, take something easy like astronomy. You need an easy A and something more difficult, like chemistry, will not really help much with your degree. So take an easy course.

**7. When using RatemyProfessor, make sure that you read the comments about the professor.** This is important because the comments give vital information about how the professor teaches. A professor with plenty of reviews that are positive tend to be good professors. However, a professor with only 5 reviews that are positive could still be a terrible professor. Also, you have to take into context of why someone would say a certain professor is terrible. If this individual failed but did not attend class, it is their own fault. If this individual attended every lecture/review/class/office hour session but still failed, it is probably how the class is taught and how the professor is.

*Disclaimer: As stated below, RatemyProfessor is not completely accurate [credit to /u/coffeelover859]. You can also figure out which professors are teaching and ask around in your major about if said professors are good/bad. You can also just ask for recommendations from fellow students on which professors to take.* 

**8. Try to do things as early as possible when it comes to college.** By this, figure out when early registration is. Register early for the best classes. Get your parking permits early to avoid any issues [like it getting lost in the mail and you have to pay for the visitor parking]. Pay tuition early or you can risk losing your classes [my own college charges an extra fee for late payments]. Also, for any online exams/quizzes, do them early. Technology can fail at any time, you can get kicked out of said exam/test [it will automatically submit], and the professor will not reopen the exam/quiz if you contact them on the time that it is due to reopen it. However, if this happened say two days before the due date, the professor will gladly help you.

**9. Always watch for the confirmation page when submitting assignments and enrolling in classes.** I made a mistake once and had my classes, but forgot to enroll in them. One class got completely full and I could not enroll in it later on. Another time, I logged out of Blackboard in the middle of submitting a major assignment. I never realized that it did not submit and had to later on show proof to the professor that I DID submit it.

**10. Keep a screenshot/picture of when you are submitting assignments or taking an online assessment.** It serves as proof that you completed said assignment. Also, when it comes to online quizzes and exams, you CAN get kicked off said exam/quiz. You can contact your professor and send them the image to have them reopen it.

**11. Try to look up questions before attending class [credit to /u/El_chupacabruh].** If it is a relatively obvious question, search it up. If not [or if you cannot find the answer/do not understand the answer], ask away. 

**12. Use a schedule/tracker to help with study times and due dates [credit to /u/KingKontinuum].** This is absolutely useful for time management. I usually use my Calendar app on my smartphone to let me know about upcoming due dates, exams, projects, university events, and so on. It was recommended to use something like iStudiez Pro as well.

**13. Do not buy textbooks until your professor specifically tells you which textbook to get [with the ISBN number] or shows you a picture of it.** You do not want to get the wrong book and then realize that you cannot refund it as you have passed the date or opened the test book [university custom edition books are loose leaf and are initially wrapped with Saran wrap. Breaking the Saran wrap means that it is un-refundable]. Trust me. Go to your first class before getting the book.

**14. Don't be THAT person in the classroom.** By THAT person, I mean the one who is very obnoxious. People are trying to learn and then you have THAT person chewing on food loudly or playing on their electronics with their volume on [no earbuds]. If a person MUST eat, try to be inconspicuous or eat soft foods. If a person has their phone out, put it on silent and have it on your lap in case of an emergency.

**15. For online classes, make sure to check every couple of days to make sure no new assignments are issued.** Online classes are awesome. You can do your work without having to drive to campus [if campus is really far]. However, anyone can get very easily off track with an online class. It is VERY easy to miss a due date, forget about a quiz, or even miss an exam. So check frequently and make a note of all due dates BEFORE the first week of school ends.

**16. NEVER take any math-related class online. Or any class that has calculations in it.** Basically, don't take any math courses, business courses that involve calculations, science courses that involve math, or any other course that involves math online. In an online class, most professors will simply post a PowerPoint with the main concepts and formulas, but they usually do not go into details about how to implement said formula. Very few will offer videos and the student cannot really ask questions to the professor directly [you CAN email but you have to wait for a response or you can go to office hours and may forget your question]. Any calculation-based courses are EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to do online [not saying it is impossible as some people may thrive in doing these courses].

**17. Don't drink/party during the week [credit to /u/iamirishpat].** Pretty obvious. You don't want a hangover before class. Weekends are better for this.

**18. Try to utilize weekends to study/finish assignments.** Pretty obvious as well. Most people do not want Saturday classes. Or Sunday classes. Use it wisely.

**19. If you are trying to register into a class that is closed, visit your counselor/academic adviser/professor of that class.** In some cases, the adviser CAN put you into said class. Also, at times, the professor may reopen the class to add in more students if you talk to them. Keep in mind that this is generally for online classes. However, the adviser is willing to let you know if people dropped out of the class, so you can still sign up for that one.

**20. Even if you are in your freshman year, try visiting the career fairs, internship mixers, and other events on campus.** It can help with networking opportunities and you will know who to contact for job opportunities/internship opportunities later on. Plus, you can make a good impression on them and they may eventually contact you.",college,Tips for College Students [Especially New Ones],https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/57d49o/tips_for_college_students_especially_new_ones/,1476415979.0

During the time I've gone to community college but didn't have a clear path on what I wanted so I took semi random classes. 

Last year I decided that I wanted to go into Forensic Science. I reached this career through various career tests and personality tests, thinking about it and researching the job.

There is one school that is in an area that I want to go to and that is nationally accredited for the program...however it costs about 40k a year. I plan on living off campus and calculating, it's slightly cheaper than living in a dorm. There are only a handful of options for this degree if I want to stay in state.

Question is, outside of FAFSA and grants, how can I pay for the remainder. The field I'm entering has a salary that matches the degree and it also gives me options if I cannot get into the specific field right away.

My counselor said that I could stay for another two years at the community college and get more credits so I spend less money but I'm very depressed being at home and at the end of my rope.

I chose my school because it was the first opportunity that I had to get away from my family and life in rural Georgia and to move to New York. I never considered the burden of the cost, the rigor and substance (or lack thereof) of the curriculum, the professionalism of the professors or any of the other things that I should have taken seriously. I also had big and admirable but unrealistic plans to start with an associates and work my way to a doctorate, but the major I chose was an afterthought.  

This has resulted in my becoming severely depressed and unmotivated. I stopped doing my work a week ago so that I could focus on my mental health. I know that I cannot stay here, but I am not sure what the next step is. I did mull over my major choices and I've chosen history which is a subject that I am genuinely interested in. I applied to a far more economical state school's online program and I am very comfortable with online learning as I graduated from an online charter high school based in Atlanta. I only have immediate plans for an associates degree, but I will consider a bachelors when the time comes. I don't feel as though I *need* a college education -- knowledge is not something that a classroom has a monopoly on; it can easily be gained individually if you are self-motivated -- but I do at least want a base-level degree so that I can get my foot in the door. 

I can't figure out what to do next though. The school that I've chosen admits 100% of applicants that meet all of their admissions requirements, which I do. It is well-ranked, but small which is why it is able to do so. Getting in is not a concern for me and if I were to get denied, the deadline to transfer is not until December for most schools. 
I am unsure of how to approach my future and I am scared. I am most scared of having to return to my parents home and to rural Georgia where I was never mentally and emotionally healthy/happy. I am also terrified of telling my parents. They have no investment directly into my education and it is my decision and only my decision, but I can imagine how they will process the words ""dropping out."" I am afraid of how I am going to be seen if I should return home: as someone who couldn't handle moving away and going to school. I don't know what's next.

Naturally, I've been thinking about doing something better with my life.  I'm considering going to college.  I tried it once at a university three hours away, but dropped out because I realized I couldn't handle that great of a distance from my family.  Now, I'm thinking about giving it yet another try.  The problem is that I'm 21 and will be 22 next fall if I decide to go then, and I'm afraid that my age will alienate me from the rest of the students, especially if I dorm.  On the other hand, I know that getting a single room or an apartment by myself would make it more difficult to make friends, possibly alienating me even more.  

I look young, have even been mistaken for a high-schooler on multiple occasions, so I doubt anyone would know I was older just by looking at me. Do you think anyone would care if they found out? And should I even bother with the dorms, or try an off-campus apartment with roommates? I have social anxiety (a big reason why I didn't go to school for so long in the first place), so I think it would help if I at least had my own bedroom to myself as a sort of comfort zone.  I know from experience, though, that totally isolating myself would just make things harder.

My school has a very strict absence policy where the professor is allowed to drop you if you miss more than two classes. This is due to the fact that the class meets for 8 hours, once a week, and if you miss two, you've essentially missed 16 hours of class a lot of critique experience as that is what the course is based on (it's an art school).

So what happened was that I missed two days and two hours of class. All of it was excused medical absence, except for the last two hours which were due to a hearing and also being very ill and unable to make it through the last hour of class.

He dropped me from the class the day before the final. I wasn't even given an incomplete, everything was voided, I am not being given a chance to make up the work or the time, I will not be receiving the credits, and I will have to pay for the course again.

This really sucks because I am now in my major (the first year at this college is a ""foundation program"" where everyone takes the same classes), and I simply do not have the time to take this class. It will absolutely not fit into my schedule during the year, and I can't do it during the summer because I'll be working or taking internships.

Academics wise I have been doing very well. I took two courses this summer as well and did fantastically.

This is all because I figured out what was wrong with me medically. I have celiac disease. For those of you who are not familiar with this condition, it is when your body creates an autoimmune response to gluten and in turn these antibodies attack your intestinal lining. This destroys the little hair/finger like tissue in your small intestine which help you digest food and absorb nutrients. This doesn't just cause a stomach ache, it affects every facet of your life. Not only does it come with gas, diarrhea, nausea, etc, it also causes depression, anxiety, fatigue, ""brain fog"", skin rashes, and a host of other problems unrelated to the GI tract. It also puts you at a 75% increased risk for cancer. This is because your body is not receiving the right nutrients and can't function properly as a result. I was brutally sick for the majority of last year. Fortunately, I am no longer eating gluten and I feel fantastic and I am doing very well. 

People with celiac disease are protected under the Americans with Disabilities act.

I'm preparing to return to college after several years of pushing a broom, so to speak. When I dropped out of college at age 20, I was frustrated and bored with the coursework I had been doing since graduating highschool. A degree in Mechanical Engineering didn't seem worth the seemingly endless homework load, the lack of free time, and the constant fear of failure. So I quit, joined the minimum-wage workforce, and fell into the routine of everyone else in my small, blue-collar town. Eventually, I joined the military, did my time, and got out. That was about 3 years ago. Since my discharge, I've been regretting dropping out of college all those years ago. So I set a plan into motion to return to finish something I should have a long time ago.

Originally being a ME major, I have always had a deep interest in the physical sciences, physics in particular. Biology is a close second. When I began seriously considering returning to college, Biology seemed like a good option. Despite loving Physics, I was not, and am still not, a person who has a natural aptitude for math. I did 'okay' in Calculus and Differential Equations, but I really had to work for those grades. It was always a bit of a struggle. With Biology, I could focus on studying something I like without having that looming fear of math hanging over my head. And, with Biology, a path to Med School seems pretty well laid out, should I choose to take that route.

On the flip side, while I like Biology, I love Physics. Studying the universe on a quantum scale, whether it be Cosmology, Particle Physics, Thermodynamics, or whatever...that is where my heart lies. The risk of failure seems much more real to me, though, in taking this course of study. I know I can do it, but the mental and physical toll it will take on me as a student is much more than if I were to choose a different major.

I also have to consider a where a career in either field will take me, geographically. I don't want to teach, either way. I want to do research, experiment, and get my hands dirty, so to speak. The area in which I currently live is thriving in terms of healthcare. Quantum Field Theory research, not so much. I have a family and own a home, so in order to obtain a decent, and, more importantly (to me), enjoyable job, I would have to relocate if I go with Physics. Biology would allow me to keep my home and stay in touch with friends and family much easier.

Just not sure what to do here. I know I'm going back to school. Do I choose the path that I LIKE, that will be academically easier (for me), and allow me to keep most aspects of my current life as they are? Or do I go with what I LOVE, and sacrifice more hours studying, and ultimately have to move away to put my degree to use?

TLDR: Physics or Biology? 
Physics: harder but it's a passion. I will have to move to find work.
Biology: a second choice, but I won't have to relocate. It's also the easier academic choice.",college,Torn between Physics and Biology majors. Looking for advice for the long run.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/54n7if/torn_between_physics_and_biology_majors_looking/,1474945373.0

I realize there are probably countless posts like this but I still wanted some inputs for the following situation. I am a junior currently and in a major i am not interested in at all. But the problem is I don't know what else I can switch into. I am not exactly sure where my interests are so I am not sure how to go about changing into something else. My thought is that if I am genuinely not interested in something, how am i going to give it my 100% especially when it would also require additional years in med school. What are some things you have heard that will help me figure this stuff out?

Also secondly, without getting too detailed I also am plagued by massive thoughts of regret. I am a junior and I don't exactly have a close group of friends yet. This sort of brings me down because I want to have a nice social life and have moments to remember college but so far its been 2 full years and my college experience hasn't been anything great. In fact, very underwhelming. Does anyone know how to turn things around? Both academically and socially? I realized everything was in my hands and I dropped the ball, but i don't want to squander another minute. I am not shy when it comes to talking to people I just struggle with meeting the right people and figuring out who to mingle with in order to get those party invites or maybe just small get-together in general. I realize that I should be having my grades as a priority (and they are) but this lack of a social life is literally killing my motivation or drive because its put me in this monotonous schedule where every day just feels like the last.

* Two weeks after graduating from high school I was attending a private art college.
* Nearly a year and a half later, I dropped out of art college.
* Now a community college student, majoring in psych, loving the material.


{ Here are my issues... }

* My intro to stats and psychology studies is going horrible. I'm probably going to flunk it. My professors are very aloof, ramble on and on about random things, and ... well.. they're great people, but suck at teaching. I -can- take just a normal stats class and have it count instead. 

ISSUE: It's too late to drop out with a refund, if I drop the class, I will get a W on my transcript. Please note I already have one W.

Should I drop it and get a W, with a chance of getting an A in a math stats class? Or should I start and have a chance at completely bombing the class and getting an F?


* Original career: educational counselor. I was very happy about this at the beginning, I honestly was very happy with any career in psychology, but... now...

ISSUE: I don't feel like any of these careers will make me happy, or is anything I would actually even put any effort into. And that's not okay for those I'm treating/helping.

I applied to the engineering school but was denied, and instead of returning to work while I try to get into a different school with an aerospace program I just picked a major off a list and went with it.

So I am thinking about transferring to a large university, like the University of Florida, Florida State, UNC, Georgia, etc,. The reason being, my major is almost useless if I don't go to a major division one university with the best possible internships, because of how competitive it gets. After this full year, my hope is to have between a 3.5 and 4.0 GPA at my current school. If I go to a large D1 school like this, the cost of attendance with out-of-state tuition can get near $40,000, if not more! My parents have recently been making way more money than they ever have ($150k+), and I will get little to no money at all from FAFSA. I personally can't afford this, and my parents recent income has come after a very hard couple of years when I was in junior high school, where they were both bouncing between unemployment and temp jobs because of the recession. My parents don't have the money to help me out yet, and I don't have the money either. My dad has an associates degree and my mom dropped out of UCLA in her third year to move to New York with my dad (dumb decision..), and my grandparents were highly educated (BS from UCLA and MBA from USC) so I won't get any ""first generation college student"" grants/scholarships. With my GPA, how much do you think I can expect to get through scholarships? I really would love to start my Sophomore year at a school like the ones I stated, but I'm not sure I can afford it, and I don't want to waste my degree at a SUNY (not that these aren't great schools, I just don't think I'll get anywhere with a Sports Management degree in central/western New York). If you guys have any experience or advice with academic scholarships and what is required, I would greatly appreciate it.

1472,BenBestQBFrom2004,1471832294,/r/college/comments/4yyeti/psa_for_anyone_who_is_at_community_college_or/,"I was a high school dropout. Told I'd never amount to anything. Told I was a loser. Told I was simply lazy. And for a while, I believed it. But you know what? I never gave up. I got my GED, much to my chagrin at the time, and enrolled at my local community college. My first semester there, I figured I'd try my best and maybe one day end up at a 4 year school. I was pretty much going through the motions at that point of my life, not really caring whether or not I failed. But then something happened. About midway through my first semester, I simply said SCREW IT. I'm gonna work my ass off. I'm gonna be the best student in every class, I'm gonna take everything seriously, I'm gonna stop messing around with my buddies every weekend. I decided to really commit to it. 2 semesters in, I decided to transfer to a 4 year college with a decent reputation, not my dream school by any means, but a place I could commute to easily and advance in my educational pursuits. At this University (a place with a 93 percent acceptance rate, for comparison), I continued to bust my ass for another semester. Having 42 credits with a 4.0 as of current date, the decision was easy...apply to my dream school and hope my 57 credits at the end of Fall 2016 would be enough. And you know what? IT WAS! I got accepted to the University of Pittsburgh and I have never been happier. The dream I had for my entire life has been fulfilled. 






The point of this post is that if I can overcome the ""high school dropout-college success"" dichotomy, ANYBODY can. You have to put the doubts, frustrations, and fears out of your mind. Your life can change in as little as a split second. Work hard, handle your business, get rid of anything detrimental to you, and get it done. There will be hard times. Hell, you might even mess up on a test or two. All those mini setbacks will pale in comparison to the pure joy you'll feel when you accomplish your goals.

I'm deciding to go back to school at 25 after some schooling. I attempted to go to school for a few years out of high school but wasn't a great student. In my time after school my credit score dropped tremendously (525, yikes!). However, in the last two years I have buckled down and gotten my life together and I'm ready to pursue my dreams again.

I don't make great money, but do plan to work during school. I'm currently looking at going to community for 1-2 years until I need to transfer to a four-year school. I'm beginning to look into loans but am trying to figure out my best options because of my poor credit.

I see the max you can take out currently in federal loans is $9,500. Does this stack subsidized and unsubsidized?
Let's say I need to take out loans for all of school (the community will cost about 7k a year, then the other two years at four-year will be about $20k a year) what are my best options if I want to have the majority of school covered?
Seeing as I'd like to avoid private loans (bad credit) what's the best route here?

I'm 31 years old and a police officer for the last 10 years. I began taking classes at my local community college about four years ago as I have realized I do not want to make a 30+ year career out of law enforcement. My passion is history (specifically medieval and warfare), always has been, and I'm finally deciding to make that the focus of my professional life (or at least one day down the line). I realize I missed my window (which sucks) going to the Ivy League or studying abroad in England, however would love to at least teach at a community college one day. Problem is money isn't free and my schedule as an officer makes attending school, especially day school, virtually impossible. I have already dropped numerous classes throughout my community college career due to my job and had to retake them, as a result my transcript has tons of lovely W's, but also A's and B's.

I have heavily researched online universities and while I understand they are not respected what other choice do I have?

I am 19, turning 20 in December, and I am going to be transferring to a four year school in the spring. I totally botched my first couple of years at my CC by being lazy, and now I want to transfer to a four year and figuring out my issues. I originally wrote a story about myself and my situation, but I decided to put that below my actual questions in case anyone was curious and has been in the same situation. Because I changed majors recently, I might be an incoming freshman in the spring, at the age of 20. If I end up being a sophomore I really don't care about my age, but is 20 an uncomfortable age for a freshman, and subsequently 20-21 for my sophomore year on campus? I was really young for my grade in high school, so a one year difference wouldn't be a big deal, but is a year and a half/almost two years something I should be concerned about? I want to fit in but I'm worried that I might be slightly too old for some people. HONEST ANSWERS ARE GREATLY APPRECIATED. I don't really look 20, I look like an 18 year old to be totally honest, and if no one brought it up no one would notice. I'm in a hurry to get to campus because I want to live the dorm life and move on from where I am right now. I can't wait another full year, I want to experience what I missed out on (because I was an idiot) before it's really too late. Please, if you guys have any advice or experience with my situation, whether it was you or someone you know, or even how you feel, I would greatly appreciate it. I'm just trying to prepare myself and create a course of action for when I leave. My story is below if you are interested.


I'm currently 19, turning 20 in December, and attending a community college. I went to my CC looking to save money and get my grades up, because my GPA in high school wasn't that great because of my work ethic. I got a 1300 on the SAT that I took once and didn't study for (regret that), 5's on every AP exam that I took, never below a 90 on any exam but a low GPA because the grades at my school were heavily weighted towards the ""homework"" part of class. I thought I would get myself to buckle down at my local CC, but after two years I haven't accomplished anything except a bunch of W's and F's for attendance reasons. My time management and work ethic prevented me from getting A's and leaving for a 4 year school. This summer I was diagnosed with ADHD, which I knew I always had but didn't want to mention out of fear of being made fun of and drugged until my personality changed. I thought I would grow out of it, but I never did so clearly getting help was urgent. After about a month of working two jobs (one being an internship at an office) I noticed a considerable improvement in my ability to get myself to focus on tasks, organize and get stuff done. I am totally confident that I can retake the classes i previously dropped and get my GPA into the acceptable range for transfer. The only issue is because of this and my major change, I will be in freshman classes for my major.

I am 23 living at home and have no college degree. I graduated high school choosing a degree at a four year university that I really wasn't sure about (didn't have the best GPA out of senior year but still managed to get into a solid school but studying something I really wasn't into). Long story short I flunked out by the end of my second year and came back to junior college.

For three years I have been taking a handful of different classes (business, mechanical engineering, CS, Chemistry, English) to provoke my interest but none have really grabbed my attention (except CS, that I grew to like and was sort of good at it). 

I cannot seem to cultivate any motivation or discipline out of any of these subjects and many other activities in my life.  I am thinking school is just not for me. I have dropped around eight classes due to lack of interest/grades and I think there is really no point in going back and attempt to school for transferring to a good college. It might be near impossible under the majors I am slightly interested in with my GPA (2.7).

Since I came back I have been suffering from depression and anxiety on and off. I just keep stopping treatment after I feel better. It just seems that my lows only happen once every few months. 

Financially I have been doing my best to be self sufficient even though my family is well off. I pay for most of my own food and all extraneous expenses. I am gifted with a roof over my head and dinner during the weekdays free of charge. Being the oldest of three, I am still struggling to get off the ground.  I currently work two jobs (only because they both were not offering many hours, its about the equivalent of one job).

Due to some mistakes that IRS has made ( already took many measures to resolve the matter but confirmed it won't be solved in time ) I will have to pay out of my pocket to finish the last year of my college.

1483,SFweddingphotographe,1470427726,/r/college/comments/4wcdbu/older_student_looking_for_advice/,"Hello everyone, 

I'm considering something but I want to get your opinions on it first.

Here is a little bit of Background:

I am 22 years old, I dropped out of high school and got my G.E.D at age 18. I'm considering going back to school to try and double major in photojournalism/Something For application/web development. Possibly computer science, but more likely something less time consuming/complicated.

I am an entrepreneur, I've been working as a professional wedding photojournalist for about 5 years now. I've started and run my own company in that field, and it generates a living wage and It's going pretty well. However, I feel like my future opportunities are low unless I keep this business going and find a way to grow it into a long term solution which can prove to be difficult. Growing this business or building another is my goal, for that I first need a decent job so I can generate the start-up capital to invest in something. but I live in the Bay area and every time someone finds out I am a G.E.D holder, They scoff and reference their Stanford or UC Berkely education.


I am 100% self-taught, But I keep feeling like even though I know my stuff, and can easily work in the field. I often get overlooked because I lack any formal education. While I have a business, I've built it in a way that I can be fairly removed from the process and still make a living wage. So basically, I don't have to work every day, or even every week. Which leaves be with a ton of free time, Now to me, Free time is wasted time. So I've picked up another job to earn extra income(to raise start-up capital), I applied for all sorts of positions in relation to my field But kept getting the same response ""Due to no formal education we have decided to not go through with your application"" So I ended up getting a soul crushing/back breaking job at a warehouse for slightly above minimum wage. 

I am an educated person, I can start, grow and run businesses.I have experience in management, marketing, finance, photography, and more but yet, I work in a warehouse.


So I've gotten started thinking lately that I need a long term solution, I need to build another business with a larger target audience that will allow me to make substantial money.

My latest thought was that maybe I should go back to school, Learn some skills and get the documentation to prove it to either land a decent paying job that will allow me to funnel money into a business idea. Or learn skills that will allow me to build a business directly, Like software development.

I've thought I wanted to Double major in Photojournalism and Software development for a few reasons. 

1. I am already very educated in Photojournalism, I've been working professionally in the field for over 5 years. So while the classes I'm sure will be challenging, they will be substantially easier for me to complete. 

2. Photojournalism, while a dying profession is one of my major passions.

3. I am also pretty educated in Programming, have taught myself a ton over the last few years. I can put together basic scripts and programs. Obviously not enough to build anything substantial, but I wouldnt be going into school completely oblivious, I already have a firm foundation in the concepts and ideas behind programming.

4. My major entrepreneurial idea is a software/web aplication that relates to Photography.


I know that was a ton to read, So i'll be blunt with my questions.

1 Do you think it is even worth it at this point to go back to school? I am already on to a track that will allow me to make decent money. But it doesn't give me very much in terms of versatility. I can probably learn everything I want online for free, but at a slower pace and without documentation.

2 What kind of financial aid would I be able to get? I know this is an extremely difficult question because everyone is different. But here is some basic info, I'm 22 years old, unmarried, Was a ward of the state (so considered independent.), make around 30K a year, live in California, first person in my family to go to college, G.E.D recipient and this would be my first time applying for college.

3 How quickly could I expect to get through school? and what is the maximum about of classes I could take per semester? I could easily put in 60 hours a week in school if I needed too. I was doing 100 hours a week for about 6 months straight to get my company started. So my only limitation is what the system allows

4 I know the general consensus is that online schools are a waste of time, and I tend to agree but are there ANY that hold any value? I work extremely well on my own, Class rooms bore me to no end. So i could just teach myself, and then test out, that would be perfect.

I already went to college but I dropped out, mainly because of anxiety issues, mainly caused by what I discovered was ""giftedness"".
Basically, I went to high school and passed exams by just snapping my fingers, and I went to college, I was 19. I picked philosophy, that I had been wanting to study since I was 15.
There I realized I never studied before in my life and I start panicking. Two oral exams during which I completely freaked out later, I started suffering depression and I dropped out altogether. I kept trying to keep my parents happy but I never managed to get passed the exams, I was just too scared of feeling like a complete idiot.
It took me seven years, numbers of bad choices and dozens of therapy sessions to understand who I was and what was happening. I'm still working on it, but now my head is clearer and I know what's blocking me.
I'm a perfectionist, intelligent person with very low self-confidence in her intellectual capabilities, while having psychologists telling me that I'm ""intellectually gifted"". Add social/work phobia, gender disphoria and PTSD to the mix and you get why I'm restless.
Recently I picked a training to become a teacher in my mother tongue. It's three-years long, easy, non-challenging, and it leads to a job that should keep my phobia at bay.
But to be honest, it's boring. I know that training, I tried it before until I dropped out as well. I know the job, I already do it online. And I know it's boring, I have absolutely no desire to do this. But it's better than a meaningless job.
The other day though, my therapist said ""well, why don't you go back to philosophy?""
And suddenly it was like lightning struck. Maybe I've been waiting for someone to tell me this for seven years. Besides, I'm not insensitive to social status. I can talk about many interesting things, but in the end I'm just a drifter most people look down to. Anyway.
I want to do this. It sounds crazy, it sounds challenging, it sounds like a lot of fun. I feel joy when I think about it.
Sure, I want to believe it's possible, and it probably is.
But how am I different now, except I understand better how my mind works?
Besides, a second failure in philosophy would just destroy me. That's why I dropped out, I didn't want to see how low I'd fall.
I still have never studied in my life. I'm still perfectionist and self-deprecating and I still have anxiety issues and my brain is still this high speed train without brakes and I still don't know how to make it stick to the right pace.
I've sorted the issue of time and money. My college application will be somewhat hectic because of the paperwork but otherwise it's fine.

I'm looking for advice on how to deal with giftedness, anxieties in college?

My first semester it went okay and I got decent grades and only got a D in music theory.  I wasn't taking many classes.  Things started to go downhill rapidly my second semester.  One of my cats died which upset and distracted me.  I had this month long drama with this friend who refused to speak to me and this was the only person I could consult about what was going on in my life.  I was really depressed.  Sometimes I would go to school and then go to the library and I even left in the middle once.

I got a C in English from cleaning up my act in the end.  I had trouble getting all the work done on time.  I failed math from procrastination and sheer lack of understanding of materials.  I don't remember anything from that class.  I took this health class that was required and the professor was incoherent.  We only had two tests and I got a C and I guess I failed the final because that's what grade I got.  I didn't understand Spanish and had to drop out.  My parents, really only my mother, would try to humiliate me by calling me a failure.  So it went really really really bad.  I only got credit in music lessons, orchestra, and English.

My parents asked me to see my report card and I fabricated one by HTML editing.  

This summer I signed up for biology, health, history, and orchestra.  Everything was going great in health.  Then it went downhill.  I had to go take a test and the testing center was closed July 2 for the holiday.  I had to drop out since now I would fail because that's policy.  I dropped out of women's history the night before because I was incredibly behind, doing quite badly, and panicking to complete the mountains of work I got bad grades on.  In biology I failed my second test.  I missed assignments from lack of planning and anxiety about completing them.  My cat died and I failed my third test.  Now I'm just going to fail.  In orchestra I got the date of the concert wrong and missed it.

My parents don't know any of this at all.  I tell them it's going well.  I put on my dress and took my instrument and had to pretend to go to a concert today.  It sounds ridiculous but it's true.

I really shouldn't have signed up for college.  Funny to say I regret going to college, lol.  At my high school there was this thing for kids who hadn't applied to college and had no plans where they took us and talked to us about community college and then had is sign up.  That was it.  It was just an expectation I go.  I wasn't ready to go at all and almost failed high school at times.  

Community college has like no one to help at all.  No emotional counseling.  Only advisement counseling.  Obviously I can't tell my parents this stuff.  I literally don't even know how they would react.  I fear at that point I would just kill myself. Nothing can hold me back from it anymore with that cat gone.  I have no plan to make this go any better in the future.  I have made friends though.

I graduated high school in May of 2012 and from there on my college experience went like this.

Freshman year: Community college where I knocked out most of my prerequisites and started some classes towards a fire science degree. I think I dropped one class or it was a class I didn't pass in.

Sophomore year: Same community college, finished perquisites besides Natural Science because I realized to this day I took a lower leveled class. Also probably had a couple classes I didn't do to good in.

Junior year: I transfered to a University instate and thats when everything went downhill. I got really turned around from school and began partying and not focusing my attention on my studies. I failed some classes, dropped others and ultimately ended up walking out and not attending any my classes the last half of my 2nd semester. So I basically failed/dropped out.

This last year has been spent just working my butt off to help repay some of the money my Dad gave me for school. I haven't thought about school until the other night when he told me that if I wanted to go back to school again then he would help pay so I could attend school. I have a couple questions in;

What is my best route for going back to school?

Now, at age 27, I'm ready to go back and get a degree (medical biology this time, at a university). 

On the positive side, most of the classes I've already taken are pre-requisites for both programs, minus some advanced math classes. On the down side, I can't retake those classes. Upon reenrolling, Chemistry II and Physics II will be among the classes I take first. I went on eBay and purchased used text books for each class, and am trying to relearn the material at home before school starts in the spring. I'm not trying to get a jump on classes that I WILL be taking, but rather trying to relearn everything from Physics I and Chem I. It's tough, and I've forgotten a lot of stuff I used to know.

Has anyone else been in this situation? How did you approach relearning past material that future classes will build on?

Anyway, right now I'm a chemistry/computer science double major.  Computer science majors come with a math minor automatically (it's part of the requirements for the major) so I have to take 5 math courses.  I am currently in a summer session Differential Equations course with three physics students.  The professor decided to teach it as an independent study so we started 9 weeks early.  I am right now behind everyone since I failed the first assignment and everyone else got As.  They both moved on past the second assignment while I am doing remedial work on the first chapter since I need to get everything down.  There are four major assignments plus a final, and I don't think I'm going to do well in this course at all.  In fact, I originally wanted to be a mathematics major and I love mathematics but I think this is a weed-out course that I can't get through, especially when all but two other courses require this as a pre-requisite.

I have until the end of the week to drop.  I am going to talk to the professor tomorrow.  I just want to get your opinions.

Also to consider is that I have another summer class in progress (but it's music theory so I pretty much know the whole curriculum already) and there is a good chance I am going to be having surgery before school starts which will put me even farther behind.  I don't want to have another class drop down my GPA since I had a lot of medical issues this past year preventing me from doing my best (I'm not blaming it all on the medical issues, but the medical issues did play a large factor) so my GPA is not as high as it should be.  If I drop this class, I can take it another time and it is not officially a requirement for the math minor as I can take another class in replacement of it.

I have only recently exited my sophomore year, and while it may be somewhat early to set my sights on any specific school, NYU has really captured my attention. I've always romanticized the city (specifically Manhattan), so the location is certainly a determining factor, not forgetting to mention the prestige of the university and success that usually follows graduates. I would be interested in majoring in something related to political science. But anyway, considering what I have done my freshman and sophomore years...

My freshman year was not personally a standout year for me. I understand that this is likely the least significant year that colleges consider, but it still has me somewhat concerned. I can't get the information right now, but adjusted to a 4.0 scale, my GPA was somewhere between a high 3.6 and 3.8... so likely around a 3.7. This was with honors classes in English, Spanish, and world history, and physical science as a regular class. I also took geometry a year ahead of a bit over half my class, as I started algebra in 8th grade. My activities included participation in my school's jazz band, Tri-M Music Honor Society and my school's newspaper. I also participated in my school's marching band which marches annually in the St. Patty's Day parade in NYC, and I will continue to do so throughout high school, though I doubt this is impressive since it is mandatory for all band members.  As I said, this year didn't strike me as remarkable. I didn't do anything over the summer after my freshman year.

In my most recent sophomore year, I again participated in Tri-M Music Honor Society and the jazz band, though I dropped newspaper from my activities as it started quite late in the year and I wasn't particularly motivated to do it (stupid, I know). However, I joined my school's debate team and participated in two tournaments, out of which I placed middle-of-the-road with my partner. Out of 4.0, my GPA this year dropped slightly to a 3.64. I took honors in biology, English, world history II and Spanish. The only academic, regular-level class I took was Algebra II. Also, I have a job as a bagger lined up for myself this summer at a local grocery store.

My classes for next year include honors pre-AP Spanish, AP language arts, AP United States History and AP psychology (which only lasts 1 semester, and the other is a mandatory gym class). I am taking regular level pre-calculus and chemistry. I obviously plan on working significantly more for my grades this coming year, as anything below average I'm sure would greatly decrease my chances of admittance to an NYU caliber school (or NYU itself).

So, my question(s) is, what should I plan on doing my junior year to improve my resume, and what can I do now? Things lacking from my current resume that I noticed include participation in sports, community service (though Tri-M requires 30 ""points"" and approx. 20-30 hours of service to maintain eligibility), and any leadership roles.

I enrolled right after high school, and went on to fail a few classes in my first semester due to a combination of mental health issues and immaturity, and subsequently dropped out for a year. 

Fast forward -- I decided to enroll again. I did a little better this time around. I earned twelve credits. However, I quit going for another semester since I still lacked solid direction. I finally became serious in January 2015. 

Ever since then, I have been working fairly hard, and have gotten all A's except for one C in Statistics. During the entire course of my studies, I was employed full time. Somehow, this didn't really bother me too much until I went overboard with the amount of credits I took during one semester. During this past session (spring 2016), I worked the graveyard shift while taking 17 credits. I was beginning to go insane. I was depressed, lacked sleep, and had no spare time. 

I have now been accepted to all four colleges I applied to as a transfer student, but only one of them is cheap enough for me to attend. I have tried almost every financial aid avenue out there. I am getting the Stafford loans (Sub and Unsub), a scholarship offered to me by the school, and a state grant. 

All of that will be enough to cover my tuition and fees, but I still need to pay rent on an apartment, which would be about $500-550 per month when adding in the utilities and internet. (The school is an hour away from where I live, so commuting is out of the question). By this point, I'm worse for wear due to burning out.

I graduated in 2015 with a BA in anthropology (focused on biological) with a GPA of 2.4.  I want to continue my education but cannot get anywhere because of my low GPA, reaching out in hope that someone can help guide me to the next step.

Some of you may get a laugh out of this, but my dream/goal is to go to medical school.  I've been told many times to give it up, my degree is useless, and so forth.  And I do admit, an Anthropology degree is pretty difficult to get around.  To make it relevant, I focused more towards the Biological side of the discipline, working with biostatistics and genetics data.  I took courses in public health, medical anthropology, biological physics, things of that nature that are offered at my university.  Academic performance and competitiveness, is where I fail at and absolutely where I should have been more careful about.  I was under a very difficult circumstance, which of course, is what many students with poor academic performance would also say to justify their GPA.  I've reflected about this over and over again and take full blame for everything, I simply want to move on and learn from these mistakes find a way to fix it.  I tell you a little bit about my background and circumstances, not as an exhaustive list of excuses, but as a lesson that hopefully someone can help me out and evaluate the options I now have.

The one positive thing about all of this, I graduated with no debt and didn't take out any loans.  I came from SE Asia and was born in a small village with no running water, no electricity, we lived a very primitive and simple life.  How I get to the U.S is a long story, and I will spare you the details.  I came here when I was relatively young, but took a while to adjust and learn all the new technology, the first time I used a computer was when I started my first day of class in the U.S, it was in 5th grade.  I was the first in my family to attend and graduate High school, and then college.  As you can imagine, everything was a ""learn-on-the-job"" type of situation.   Applying to college was a magical situation for me, everything was online, submit a few essays...and that's it.  Who submitted my documents, test results? How'd they know it's me? Everything was just done automatically, it was a little shocking to me.  But somehow, I managed it, I got in a decent state college (UF).  I was a little behind the curve with technology, but everything else, I managed.  But that's when everything just went sour.

Being away from home was, of course, a little difficult.  But I managed the first two semester fine.  My second year and forth is when everything just went bad.  I started overthinking about what I wanted to do, the end goal, that I over load on volunteering, extracurricular, silly resume booster things that are now meaningless because of my incompetent GPA.  My grade dropped, I became ineligible for the grants and aid I was receiving and ended up having to take a job to cover for these expenses.  I was literally illiterate when it comes to money and financial aid at that point.  My parents advised me against loans (it's a big no-no and highly stigmatized for them), and of course I listened.  I made absolutely no use of the resources available, had no idea where to look for help or even ask questions, I felt like completely lost and ashamed in front of my peers with my situation.  Looking back, I was a fool and hated myself for it.  I worked overnight shifts and weekends at the hospital, scheduled my classes early in the morning so i can go straight to class after work, getting paid 10/hr, you can imagine how it was to pay for 3-4k tuition a semester.  My schedule would often look like this: 10pm-8am (work) 8:30-noon (class).  It was exhausting, I studied on the job, on the bus, between classes, during lunch, on the toilet, literally anywhere, just to get by with a 2.4.  Pretty sad, I know.

I graduated and working now at a dead-end job that pays 9/hr, even worse than when I had no degree.  Doing everything I can, volunteering, researching, everything and anything to hope for a chance that some school would look pass my horrid GPA and a somewhat irrelevant degree.  My GPA is too low to even apply to any postbacc, masters, certificates.  Some have suggested that I do some DIY classes at a nearby school to raise my GPA, but that would require me to be a non-degree seeking student, which would rule out financial aid, I can't afford tuition with my job and even if i could, that would be making the same mistake all over again.

What should I do reddit?  I've consider cutting my losses, apply for a second degree and get a STEM major? I'm really at a dead-end this time around and it's becoming quite a burden/depressing thing to handle.  Reaching out for some words of wisdom and advice.  Thank you, reddit.

1500,Gamerbrandona,1466927924,/r/college/comments/4pwtqo/which_should_i_take/,"It's been about 2 and a half years since I have taken a math course and have had trouble passing remedial math twice, and dropped the course twice. I had since retaken the placement and scored into regular algebra (Math 103) last year, and so this coming fall semester I have decided to take math and knock it out. 

I have been doing MUCH better in school, changing my 2.5 gpa to 4.0 and am wondering if I should take Math 103 or Math 103M which is a class that is for people who have trouble with math. Some downsides are that I will need to take a Math 103 Lab with Math 103M and the professor is currently TBA, as well as the fact that I would have to kill an hour and 45 minutes for two days between my class. 

The other option is to take 103 with a professor who has good ratings on RMP, but is a regular math course. 

Both courses fulfill my math requirement. The easier math requires a lab, which means more class time. Money isn't an issue considering my school caps tuition.

Any suggestions?

Extra note: This fall semester is my first time at a University (coming from community college) and will be full-time, the reason for taking math now is that I am finishing up on my lower ed classes so it would be best to take math now, and my placement is about to expire.",college,Which should I take?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4pwtqo/which_should_i_take/,1466945924.0
1501,VictorDSoule,1466730478,/r/college/comments/4pk5b8/so_im_starting_community_college_this_fall_but_i/,"So a little bit of background first, I've been practicing journalism outside of school for about 6 years now give or take, working at pretty small websites. I'd like to take my passion for journalism and get a degree in the field to help with my career prospects, but there's one problem.

I'm 23 years old, I dropped out of high school and recent pursued my GED. Now I'm going to community college, with the hope that I can transfer to a university afterwards. 

But here's the real problem. I'm located in an area with two community colleges, both of which are relatively small. I applied to the one closest to me, and since they don't have a transfer program for journalism, I decided to list myself as a communications major with plans to attend UCLA once I've finished up my 2 years here.

Today I saw a counselor at the community college I'll be attending this Fall, and they told me that a communications major would be fine for journalism. They also tell me that UCLA, the school I'd like to go to, does not have a journalism program. I've done some research, and as far as I can tell that seems to be true, but I'm not entirely sure.

I don't want to pursue a degree in communications, I want to pursue a degree in journalism. I don't know how exactly they differ, because I've seen journalism jobs that do accept a degree in communications so I figured I'd do that at the community college, even though my real passion and interest is in journalism.

I guess the question is, if anyone can help clue me in on this stuff.. is communications a decent major for someone interested in journalism? If I want to go to UCLA, is it worth transferring as a communications student, or should I look at going to a different school that supports journalism?

I suspect that most people think this is a question that a counselor should answer, and I think so too, but unfortunately the counselor I saw today was of no help. Everyone in their office including the counselor I saw was extremely rude, and from what I've heard, that's a common complaint.

Anyway, if anyone has any resources that they'd recommend to help me out, or can give me some guidance directly, I'd really appreciate it. Apologies for the long post, but I am very, very confused and I want to make sure that I make the correct decisions that will put me where I want to be in life.

https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4l0e5a/i_was_dropped_from_my_class_a_day_before_the/

That thread has all of the information you need to know up until this point, but I'll give a brief summery. I go to a very intense college, and the absence policy states that if you miss two classes, the professor is allowed to withdraw you. Excused or unexcused, it doesn't matter. You can have the most valid reason in the world to be absent and you will still get dropped because ""you deserve the full experience"". Some teachers choose to enforce it more than others. The reason it is so harsh is because we have a type of class called a ""studio"". These classes meet once a week, run for eight hours, and then assign an absolute mountain of homework. Students in this program have three studio courses a week. 

In my personal situation, I was dropped from the course on the last week of class because I was absent for two days, and two hours of class. The absences were due to medical reasons and doctor's appointments. The two extra hours were due to a hearing in which I testified. Even though I had made up all of the work, was fully ready for the final, and had good grades, I was withdrawn. I did not even receive an ""incomplete"" grade. My progress was voided and I am now being required to retake the entire course. This takes up a lot of time, and a lot of money on my part. Not only that, but because of being withdrawn from this class, I am now on academic probation and will lose my scholarship and financial aid, which are the only things allowing the privilege of attending this college. 

If you are curious exactly *which* school this is, you can refer to the comments under my last post, I just feel uncomfortable mentioning the name in the main body of this post.


Since that last post, I have met with numerous departments, deans, and advisors within the school. I have touched base with every department that I could think of being even in the least bit relevant to my situation. Every person I met with in regards to this issue was very impressed with the amount of effort I have been putting in to try to sway my professor's opinion. They commended me for working so hard for something that I wanted to change. 

I have decent grades as well, I currently have a 3.5 gpa, which is not particularly easy to maintain at this school.

I am not asking for an immediate grade in this dropped course, I am only asking for an opportunity to complete the requirements needed to receive credit and *earn* a grade. 

I have contacted the professor twice. Once in the initial correspondence when I was informed that I had been removed from the course, and once again the other day. The first time, I did not receive a response. This second time, I took a different approach. Before, I had tried to justify the legitimacy and need for the absences taken. This time, I approached him with suggestions for alternatives to a full class, but things that could potentially fulfill his requirements. 

I understand how much work allowing me to complete the course would mean for him, especially since it is outside of the semester. I offered researching other, shorter, weekend courses that could help me make up for missed studio hours and provide opportunity for critique from classmates (an important component of a studio course). I suggested writing an essay, doing an independent project, seeking out a related lecture, revisiting a previously assigned project, actually traveling out to his city to meet with him to save him the time and stress of coming here, etc. I showed that I was willing to go above and beyond because completing this course matters so much to me.

He responded today.. He said that he appreciated my eagerness to brainstorm alternatives and willingness to work, but that nothing could make up for the missed class time. 


I am at a complete loss. The dean of this department won't do anything, the professors have a lot of freedom in this school. The other departments I have met with are unable to do anything either. I don't want to stop fighting.. because if I lose, I'll lose the privilege of attending this school, for financial reasons and time constraints. 


**UPDATE:** I have been in contact with financial aid and I explained my case. They said that while I am on academic probation due to being below the required number of credits, I will still receive financial aid as well as my scholarship because I have good grades. So that's a relief.. Now the problem is that I cannot get a refund for the class, nor can I get the credit.. which is silly.. I don't understand why I can't just have one or the other.",college,"[Update] I was dropped from a class the day before the final, I have been unsuccessful in negotiating a compromise",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4nocrx/update_i_was_dropped_from_a_class_the_day_before/,1465714877.0

So I have been mainly looking into regular/standard universities in my state such as UCF or UF because they offer my major there (which is going to be in Physics, more specifically Astrophysics); but I was mainly looking into UCF because my brother also attends there and family is always important. 

I have already applied to UCF for this fall and was originally put on to the waitlist but now I have been deferred so I am currently waiting on their decision. If I end up getting denied then I have already been accepted into a local community college but I absolutely loathe the town I am in but if that turns out to be my only option then so be it.

My mother has recently been talking about other colleges as well such as Florida Institute of Technology as well as Embry Riddle. She seems to think that I would be much better off going to one of the specified institutes. While I think that the quality of teaching and the odds of getting a career connections I would gain from going to an institute might be a little bit higher I don't feel like I would get the same experience of college at an institute. I'm not talking about partying or anything of that nature but the variety in people, characters, and cultures I would see and meet at UCF or UF compared to FIT since FIT is geared for STEM majors whereas UCF/UF have so many more degrees.

What are the pros and cons of each? I know for a fact that FIT and Embry Riddle are going to be marginally more expensive which means more loans at the end and that is always a con.

EDIT 2: probably science, because video game development and it has classes that i can have for the minor in physics, however I admire motherboards and stuff like that.
-------
First, I’d like for you to know my background:
I have just finished my first year in college, and I have been declared as a psychology major. This however, I seem to doubt.

I've been always a science lover, and I always have been interested in space-like things. (Like the recent development of rocket landings made by SpaceX, and the discovery of gravity waves) and I am leaning towards changing my major to Astronomy (unlikely cause I don’t want to be a teacher), Physics, Computer Science/Engineering or Mechanical Engineering (for aerospace engineering). 

I loved math and science as a child growing up, as I watched the Discovery Channel on tv for most of my free time (Documentaries are so cool). I knew how to use the computer around an early age (about 4 years old), and I loved technology. I was really good at mathematics throughout elementary and junior high as I was tutored by my engineering dad. I was a very smart kid in regards to science and math (which led to alot of bullying but thats another story).

Then high school. 

I took Geometry Honors as my freshman class, and I believe this tore my mathematical skills. I was always distracted by my friends in the class and I began to drop my grade. I passed the class, however, it led to a decline. I took Algebra 2 and Pre-calculus after that barely passing with a C. I will accept my fault and say, my hormones led to stressful times and I had pretty bad distraction skills. (These stressful times led to my interest in psych btw!) I took a break my senior year and took two band classes (I'm pretty much praised at Saxophone playing in that city block, so it was my talent.) I graduated, and I went to a state school undecided. 

I was split between Music, Psychology, and Business ( I do sales for an insurance company, thats why), and after a semester in college, I chose Psychology, and I have taken one class so far. I really like it tbh, because I learned about the brain and I learned the benefits of neurology. After finding out a major in sales is not much, I dropped my business interest, and after finding out a music degree is also not much (I'm sure experience and reputation gets you places, and being a musician is a varied salary, not a stable one), I was ok with my psych choice. THEN I HIT A WALL. 

I'm breaking my mind here. I looked back at my childhood after seeing a rocket launch for the first time about two months ago, and I wish I can make a rocket fly too! I'm trying to connect Psychology with space by saying ""oh maybe I can study the behaviors of submariners and connect it with space travel so that I’ll have an astro-psychological workplace in the future. (I’ve posted about this https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/4gmz7r/i_have_decided_to_pursue_a_degree_of_psychology/ ) In the mean time, I was planning to study until I have a PHD on clinical psychology and study forensic psych, but that seems like a lot of experience in between that I am skipping and might not like. I also have a connection with an autism company through my mom, and I have done the Basic part of the psych major requirements. 

As far as making rockets fly, I HAD math skills, and now I just passed my statistics with a C (my professor was reaaaally bad http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=449867 ). I really want those skills back. I want to be able to do astronomical things. However, what would the chances be of me being employed by a space-faring company as well? what would I do in the meantime? I have so many un-answered questions, and if you read this far, I love you. (No seriously, thank you. It means a lot for me). I am really good with computers too. I love electronics and I try to learn on my own about coding through Khan Academy. (I really wish this was available for me MUCH earlier…) 

I have taken a career test that my university offers, and it tells me to be a dancer, an artist, a crafter, or a biologist, and frankly, I don’t find any of these interesting or have a decent salary.(except Maybe bio, but what would I do for a career?) 

So whats your opinion Reddit? Should I continue my major in Psychology? or should I listen to the child in me, and instead of dreaming of doing a mathematical job (like programming, engineering a rocket, or architecture), should I go for an Engineering degree? I’m not gonna lie, this is making me VERY depressed as I haven’t found a purpose in life.

1507,boopityboopboopity,1464192512,/r/college/comments/4l0e5a/i_was_dropped_from_my_class_a_day_before_the/,"I am a freshman at art school. Here, we have two different types of classes, liberal and studio. The liberals are your average, 'meet twice a week for two or three hours' type deal. The studio courses, on the other hand, meet once a week, for eight hours at a time, and have a very strict attendance policy. 

You know how you can just decide to skip a class one day while at university? Maybe you're feeling under the weather? Maybe you're hungover? Maybe you're just not ""feelin' it"" today? As long as there wasn't a scheduled exam, or you didn't have a presentation due, you'll probably be fine. You're only missing a lecture, which will probably be posted online anyway. 

Yeah. Well it isn't like that with a studio. Often these days are split into critique, and work periods. We start the day off with a four hour critique (sometimes they're six hours.. or sometimes they last for the whole eight hours). They are incredibly grueling to sit through. You literally just sit there, try to find something to say about your peers pieces, and fight to stay awake because you're most likely running on less than five hours of sleep due to the fact that you are also taking two other studio courses and they all assign at lest ten hours of homework.

There is a very strict absence policy when it comes to studio classes (some professors enforce it more than others). You are allowed two days of absence, any more than that will get you booted from the course. Excused or unexcused, it doesn't matter. Your parents could die, and you will still be booted from the course if it means that you've gone over two days because ""you deserve the full educational experience, it's not a punishment."" People come to class, sick as dogs, because they can't afford to get kicked out. If you get bumped from two studio courses, you get kicked out of the school entirely. They are very serious about what they do.

So. I was just booted from one of my studio courses. The week of the last class, the final critique. It's because I missed two days and two hours of class.. not even a full third day. It was all due to health issues... but the final two hours that pushed me over two days were because of a hearing that I had to testify in. I was still in class that day, I didn't miss any information because this hearing took place during a work period (we were working on this project out of class as well). 

I have spoken with the dean, and she agrees that my reasons for absence were completely valid, but that she cannot chance the professor's mind. This school allows the professors to have a lot of freedom, and basically play god within their own class. 

The thing is that I have done *all* of the work. I have been doing well in class. I even took up drinking coffee so that I could stay awake in this particular class because it *mattered* to me. I have immense respect for the professor and was in communication with him through these periods of absence. I was very honest with him about a *very* personal reason why I was absent for one of those days. It wasn't that he disliked me, I think that I was actually up there as one of his better liked students.. maybe. I stayed after class sometimes and just asked him about the industry and my future major, etc. He knew that I was a dedicated student.

Not only have I been bumped from this course, but I will not be receiving *any* credit either. I am being required to retake this entire course. You see, this is a very expensive school, art supplies are expensive as well. I have spent upwards of $300 on supplies for this course. I have done the work, I have completed the projects, I have been present in class, even when I was sick as hell. 

I will not be let back into the class (I mean, the final critique was today).. but I feel like I deserve an incomplete. I am willing to make up any amount of work.. I am willing to do extra projects. I am *not* willing to retake the entire course. 

This situation is making me lose faith in this school. I understand that it's supposed to be hard.. but if he won't allow me to complete the course by doing some extra work.. if I'm required to retake this course after I made it this far (I had my final project ready to go but I was told not to come in).. I will probably leave the school. 

I really don't know what to do. I have emailed the professor (hasn't gotten back to me yet), spoken with the dean (can't really do anything about it), and emailed several other people who I have yet to meet with. I can't take any legal action because he is only going by his syllabus, it's on paper. I have no case. 

I just really need some guidance.

My first semester I did pretty well, although I did fail a class due to my teacher being an asshole - yes, seriously. 

Anyway.  I'm working a job right now that makes me enough money to pay the bills, with a little bit of savings. I don't want to do this job the rest of my life. I have a husband who is in full swing of his career, so I have stability. I could drop to 3 days a week but work more hours and make almost the same amount, which would open up some time for me to go to school and study. 

I know what I'd like my major to be, so I have a direction.  I'm just terrified of starting school again for a few reasons.
1 - As previously stated - I'm afraid of going back to school and not being able to test and do homework assignments. 
 2 - Being overwhelmed with work and school. My job is physically and emotionally demanding so it could put a damper on my studying. 
3 - The chance of me not being able to make enough money so we aren't broke, due to not working as many hours. Also, I would feel horrible if I wasted money on another semester from freaking out and dropping out. 

I feel ridiculous writing this post, but any insight would be helpful.

Ended up working as an accountant and financial analyst for 2 years. I wasn't happy so I quit. Tried looking for other jobs, but with no good luck. During those times I felt lost and no longer sure what I wanted to do with my life. Ended up not working for a year. Found a short term job and worked for 2 months before deciding to go back to school in January 2015. 

I straight up took 5 classes since I wanted to finish and transfer immediately. It got too much and my bad habits from my senior year (procrastinating) kicked in. Dropped my physics class to attempt to salvage C++ and calculus. Things got worse and ended up withdrawing from those two so I can just focus on my CAD and intro Chem classes. However, dropping all those classes sent me to depression. How could I do so bad when I thought I'm finally doing what I really want to do? Other aspects of my life was bad too -- financial, dating, family. I had serious thoughts of suicide. It was the worst period of my life.

In retrospect, I jumped too deep into the water without warming up first. I met with a therapist as a last resort after being forced by a close friend. Luckily, the therapist was able to point out and explain what I was going through. Otherwise, I was really ready to end my life. (long story dating back to my childhood experience + gradual development of depression since 2010 after losing interest in my original goal + unhappy at work). 

I continue going to school since I want to become an Engineer. Last semester I took Physics, C++, Calculus, and intro to Engineering. Ended up dropping calculus again. I did well in C++ and Engr, but barely managed a B in Physics. This semester, I'm taking Public Speaking, Chem 1, Physics 2, and Linear Algebra. Dropped my math class after the first month. Struggled again in Physics and dropped it too :( I have been meeting with the school counselor to figure out what's going on with me and so I don't go back to depression. It's been helpful even if it's slow baby half-steps.

I love going to chem labs. I would not mind spending my whole day doing experiments and hands-on work. I do best in that setting. Not only I have fun, but my brain is actually functioning! Doing homework and studying is a completely different story though. It stresses the hell out of me. I have solid A in chem lab, D/F in exams and homework. It's absolutely hard to start it and even harder to stay focused. I would almost instantly end up doing something else. I really want to do well, but it's like my body doesn't listen to me and refuses to study. 

I met with a different counselor at the Disabled Services to assess my learning struggles. I can't meet with her again until Fall 2016, but she did say I definitely have red flags for ADHD. It's a bit funny because I never seriously considered myself potentially having one, so I started thinking more about it. I didn't notice until recently that I'm constantly having the need to touch and play with my hands. I also can focus well, but only when the activity is highly stimulating and interesting. I bought her recommended book plus other gadgets like this timer cube. If anything, I got even more efficient at doing chores which I never had any problem doing anyway (physical, hands-on) but studying/homework is still very much a complete struggle for me. Counselor told me to take 3 classes max per sem. At this rate I won't finish my degree until I'm already 30 &lt;.&lt; I don't mind really, I just want to do well and enjoy life. Studying and homework just totally stresses me out that I forget to enjoy things. 

At the end of the day, it makes me think whether being in school is the best for me? I do want to be an engineer and do hands-on work -- particularly materials engineer since I want to specialize in testing. I enjoy thinking about different variables, finding an object's limitation and applications, etc. I have tons of fun in chem labs. Sitting down to study and read though is a big sacrifice that I really struggle with :( I look at it in different perspectives -- investment, sacrifice, it's part of learning, things will get better, reward system, suck it up... but the same result. I end up not doing well and dropping classes. Perhaps studying and doing homework in school setting is beyond my capabilities? Should I instead find a hands-on job maybe in manufacturing or testing and work my way up from there?

1513,StevenCollins21,1463336013,/r/college/comments/4jh8ij/transfer_issue/,"I am stuck in a tough position at my current university and I am quickly running out of time to decided what to do. I had previously screwed myself but I am trying to work out of my jam.

This goes back to 2009 where I enrolled at the University of Akron fresh out of high school. I wasn't the worst student in high school but not the best, I certainly didn't try and just got by on what I came naturally to me. I took my acceptance to Akron and did not apply anywhere else. Once at Akron I had no drive or guidance in what I wanted to do with my schooling and basically attended college because I thought I had to. I spent about 4.5 years there on and off never receiving a degree there. I made a huge mistake by not attending any of my classes my final semester there, literally only enrolling so I could play lacrosse. This dropped my GPA below a 2 but at the time I didn't care I was not planning on attending school and was moving to NYC with a job lined up.

Fast forward one and a half years later and my job isn't working out as I expected and decided to get real and go back to school. I transferred to LaGuardia Community College in spring of 2016. I began to pursue a degree in computer science, this is also the first time I've had a definitive major. Unfortunately they only accepted 12 of my 70 credits and my advisers at LaGuardia apparently did a poor job advising me as I've been locked out of every class but one for fall 2016. 

My intention has always been to transfer back out as soon as possible to attend a 4 year school again but the current situation will not allow me to receive any financial aid because I will not be taking a full time course load and even if I was, TAP will not give any aid as I'd only have one major specific course in the fall. after completing the spring semester and summer there is no doubt in my mind I will have received all A's for my 23 credits attempted there. 

My concern is going to another university. I am currently 24 and will be 25 come fall 2016 and do not want to delay this any longer. What choises do I have in terms of transferring to either another CUNY school or private university in NYC? I have 4 letters of recommendation from my current professors but I don't know if that will be enough for schools to see past my low GPA. After this semester is complete I should be floating in the 2.5ish range and that is still undeniably low but do I have any real chance or options in terms of getting into somewhere else with the current grades I have received?

I am willing to go to almost any school in NYC if they offer a computer science program and I am willing to pay private school tuition but I think that is a reach in terms of getting in. My other option would be returning to the University of Akron, which I am willing to do, but I am already in New York and would like to make school work here. Do I have a chance or am I completely boned for the fall and stuck at LaGuardia taking one class?

The second time I went, I had some pretty big personal problems come up (a close friend passed away and my mom became very ill a few weeks apart) and got dropped from all of my classes for attendance, even though my grades were fine. I did not enjoy what I was studying.

Now, I have suffered an injury that keeps me from working, and it's driving me INSANE. I spend most of my waking time doing surveys on MTURK and other similar sites, just trying to make enough money to help my family scrape by. 

I have no idea what I want to do for a living, and to be honest, money isn't really important to me other than being able to live in a decent house and afford the necessities. Would like to be able to buy a game or go to the movies, etc, now and again but nothing super extravagant is necessary.

I'm currently a student studying Computer Science at UC Santa Cruz and I'm very unhappy here. It's not that the school itself is bad in any way, more so I very dislike the lifestyle of UCSC/SC, making me very miserable here. 

I'm trying to weigh my options:

1. Attend UCSC in the Fall, and apply to transfer as a high credit junior to certain UCs. (AFAIK transfers from UC to UC are much more competitive than from CC to UC)
2. Drop out and attend CC in the Fall and TAG to a UC after a year. The problem with this is I'm already done with GEs and will have junior standing at the end of this quarter, so I won't really have any classes to take at CC
3. Tough it out and graduate from UCSC in 3 years. 

I'm heavily leaning towards option 2, but I may be wasting a year of my life with that option. I'm seriously miserable here at UCSC, but maybe things will get better.

1516,forget4,1462492191,/r/college/comments/4i2mnz/word_of_advice/,"I'm a 21 year old in college right now. I started at community college in the Fall of 2012. I didnt know what to major in, didnt even know college was an option for me because of financial struggles until mid way through my senior year of high school. I got through cc by the Fall of 2015. I had missed a semester because of financial issues, took less classes at times because I wasnt sure what to major in, had failed a math class, dropped a class because of a bad teacher, and because I wasn't able to transfer more credits. I got my A.A. in General Studies and am wroking towards a B.S. in Accounting now.

The university I transferred into is great, just had a great semester, met a lot of people and I love the place. Although, I was not able to continue to do Accounting, or any Business related majors at my school so I had to decide between transferring, again, or stay and do something else that I wasn't sure about. Ultimately I chose to switch schools and accepted their offer last week. I knew I could get rejected from the major which is why I had applied to the other university just in case. Now I have to switch out again, and maybe have to take more credits and I wont graduate by Spring 2018 if I am lucky. 

If I could go back I would tell myself the major I wanted and the track to get it done ASAP. Some of my high school class is graduating this semester. I still got two years left and I hate this. If you aren't sure about college, take your time to think about it, work jobs, travel if you can. If you dont think you can go because of financial issues, try community college first and look for financial aid as well. My cc had scholarships as well, which helped me out. Know where you're transferring to or the school you are going to and prepare for the requirements. Make sure your credits transfer as well.

Talk to people, counselors, advisors, friends, etc. for help. College is a good investment if its for you, just be prepared for what could happen. Dont stress too much, give yourself a break if you need it, make time for school, relaxation, sleep, and work if you are working. I learned that the hard way. Also, enjoy college as well, make friends, put yourself out there, go to events, join a club, play sports, its not just about a degree, you can have fun too.

I wish people had told me this before so I wouldnt be in school for so long and could enjoy it better. I stress out a lot so I feel like crap switching schools again as if I failed. I would not wish this on anyone and I hope someone who needs this sees it. Anyone can go to college if they want to, just be prepared, if you dont want to, then you dont have to.

You always hear about stories of students who are straight A's in high school and hit a concrete wall in college. You don't think it will happen to you, but maybe that was the exact mistake I made.

I'm enrolled in 18 credit hours in my 2nd semester. Amidst my already deep depression because of staying away from family, having no friends, completely different culture, I was dropped from my fraternity a few days before initiation. This lead to my spiralling deeper into depression and substance abuse (alcohol) that landed me into my ER. Fan-fucking-taastic. Along with paying for college, I landed myself into deeper trouble with hospital bills that approximately exceed 3k USD - all over a few shots of cheap, low-shelf liquor.

I came into college with motivation - I believed that I could change the world if I studied CS. I knew I would require a 3.0 to be guaranteed my major of choice and got an okay 3.66 in my first semester. This semester however, my GPA has tanked to a lower than apple-bottom jeans 1.6. I'm failing an online class which I was actually getting an A in - the school website crashed and the points I had before were completely gone and the professor wont accept my proof showing the points I had (I took a snapchat a few weeks before the crash).

The thing is that I can't tell my parents my GPA over the summer. I can't tell them that I'm hugely depressed and have seriously contemplated and acted upon my suicidal thoughts. I have 2/3 withdraws left for classes, but I'm trying to save them up for later because shit happens. I can't tell them about my altercation with the police and me going to the hospital. I know for a fact that if I tell my mom that I'm depressed, she will kill herself. If I add that I was in an ER because of alcohol poisoning, I won't be able to go to college ever again and will most probably be disowned. I'm currently trying out the counseling sessions at school but they down't help much considering that this is the end of the semester. My academic advisor is probably going to ask me to withdraw.

I want to do CS more than anything. Ever since I was a kid, I have always been able to ""talk"" to computers better than humans. It is something that I feel I was born to do. However, I can't retake classes and graduate in 5 years because I will be ridiculed in my family and be the butt of jokes (i.e look at him. Everyone's completed engineering in 4 years and this idiot took 5 years. Don't be like him, kids). I know I probably have to do this, but how can I go around telling my parents? I can't just sit them down and tell them that I've fucked up so bad that only time can repair the damage.

TL;DR First to save you from my run-on sentence... 

Going to college for first time after a year off and am not sure what to expect, and am worried I won't do very well. 

So my situation.

I graduated a year ago, from high school. Now after a year of being out of school I'm looking start back in the fall attending college. I'm excited and nervous and all the things you'd expect from someone going back to school. The problem is that I'M not sure what to expect at all. 

To elaborate, I didn't originally go back to school because I wasnt really great in high school and I was in a trade school which really pushed college out of mind, so to speak. So I guess I just didn't feel like I'd be able to do college and keep up with things. However after my year off, I've come to terms with the fact that if I want to learn and apply myself, I will be just fine. I've matured a lot, being out of school for a bit was a hell of a reality check for me, that I surely needed. I guess I just need a push to assure that I can handle going back to school. I'm a very positive, self motivated person, and not one to usually doubt myself. But I also think about things like, I haven't taken a math class in 2 years. Never taken a Chem or advanced science type course, sweating the small things, if you will. 

I'm just worried I won't make it I guess, as well as seeing my friends have already dropped out after thier first semester, thats disheartening. Too much time and money involved to fail. Just looking for advice on things to do to help me school when I go back.

Now I am a resident of Florida and have gone to the community college in Palm Beach county retaking classes I failed in PA (my home state, I am from the greater Philly area). To be blunt, I am not a fan of Florida and none of my family is down here, however I have made a few friends and have a basic life set up here.

It's been almost three years since then, and I'm looking to go back...but for Nutrition and Dietetics. After ten years (I'm 25, by the way) of wondering what the heck I'm good for and what I even like, I reflected a bit and saw a pattern - I've always been interested in nutrition, food, how our body works to digest, researching how to lose weight, gain muscle, etc. I've learned a lot on my own through years of just looking stuff up online, but I was some formal training with a damned Bachelor's degree that will get me a job. 

**Here's the plan:**

There are no schools in my area that offer a Bachelor's in Nutrition. University at Buffalo offers a minor in Nutrition, but that's not what I'm looking for. I think my only option is to do an online degree.

I did a little research and found that [University of Alabama](http://bamabydistance.ua.edu/degrees/bs-in-hes-food-and-nutrition-online/) has an online Nutrition program, and the reviews of it sound pretty good. I would just need to take some core classes at my local college that UoA doesn't offer online, then I can apply for this program.

What scares me is the horror stories of people doing online programs to find out they were super scammed, got charged for classes they didn't attend which then went to collections, or paid way too much for a for-profit degree mill piece of crap that the real world doesn't view as a real degree.

Does anyone have any experience with this University of Alabama's Bama by Distance program? Is it totally weird for a girl in Buffalo, New York to ""attend"" a school in Alabama, where she will probably never set foot in in her life?

I fear that I will graduate late because my school REALLY emphasizes taking 15 credits (5 classes) a semester. Total needed to graduate is 120. Some semesters, I've only taken 4 classes, with no winter / summer classes because 4 classes a semester is still considered to be full time and I wanted to just relax and hang out with friends and go on vacation with family during the summer and winter. I thought just 4 classes a semester would be fine, but then I realized that that's not too good for the 120.

Also, I've had to retake calculus last semester because I failed it (but finally passed) and I dropped French 3 this semester because the course work was just too much for me, with that of the other classes I am taking now, so these delayed me.

1530,KenAdams87,1458516615,/r/college/comments/4b9uwb/cant_find_a_careerjob_that_im_passionate_about/,"I'm 28 years old, and have been going to community college off and on since 2009 while working part-time jobs and living with my parents, having switched majors 3 times. I have a mixed record of passed and failed courses, mostly due to my lack of interest in school from middle school onto high school. I have always been a C/D student in high school, being especially bad at math (all D's in high school, and at least 2 that I only got because I needed them to graduate). 

After high school and 2 years of working, I decided to go back to college and take some transfer courses. Needless to say, my first 2 semesters were disastrous, having only passed 3 classes. The next year, I decided to major in radiology. I passed the freshmen classes but failed the tougher anatomy classes, and after passing my EKG class I quickly figured out that I didn't want to work in a hospital. The class was a struggle for me, and I was the only one out of the class of 6 that didn't pass the CPR class the first time. 

So I dropped out and worked full time at a grocery store. I didn't have enough money to get my own place, and I knew that I wouldn't be able to handle school with a full-time job, so I was essentially stuck for about a year and a half until my store closed and I got laid off. I tried to get a job at a local company that specializes in tubing, and despite passing the required test (and having a relative that worked there), I didn't get the job. 

I saw the setbacks as an opportunity to go back to school for a business degree, and although I passed most of the freshmen classes with a range from A's to C's, I failed business math, and failed miserably with accounting despite going to tutoring on an average of twice a week. 

Last Fall, I made the decision to go to school part time while working 2 part time jobs. Unfortunately, I failed Business math again and I seem to be barely squeaking by in the senior-level courses (the work load is INSANE, I have no idea how the hell people who work pass these classes). I'm taking accounting over again, and while I'm doing better, I still feel like I'm struggling, despite asking questions and getting help from the tutor. 

I went in to this degree with the idea that having it would help me land a decent job outside of retail, but between not really knowing what I want to do and struggling with the math/technical portions of the program, I'm not so sure now. I'm not really interesting in marketing, HR, entrepreneurship, etc. Maybe with some exposure to jobs in those fields, it might convince me otherwise, but the classes bore me to no end. I know one thing that is definite...I sure as hell DO NOT want a career in retail. 

I have hobbies like fitness and music, but I'm not particularly interested in cultivating them into careers. Some kind of a desk job would be something I'm interested in, I just don't know what yet. 

So I guess this is a two-part question: Should I press on with the business degree? I am in my fourth semester but I still have 12 classes to go after this one is done. I really want a decent job and the ability to live on my own and be independent, but I don't have a clue what I really want to do. Also, what can I do to improve my abilities with math and accounting? (I particularly have trouble with both subjects whenever problems get to be too long. My mind tends to mix numbers around and doesn't seem to keep everything organized when a problem gets really complex, especially when they are word/math problems, and despite writing notes down and tracking the steps to the problem). 

I apologize for the long post, but I wanted to be as descriptive as possible. I'm just tired of school and tired of not making a decent living. I feel stupid and ashamed for still being at this stage this late in my life, and feel like almost everyone in my social class is smarter and more efficient than me. I'm sick of it. Any help would be extremely appreciated, thanks.

I've done 1 Semester of Lib Arts, 6 years ago, and I dropped out of High School when I was 16. I make an okay living, but I think I want to do more with my life then blue collar.

I think I want to settle into CS/IT as that seems to be the future, and it's certainly interesting. I'm slowly starting to teach myself a bit of Python/Java, but I think an actual classroom would benefit me better.

I initially started with the idea of doing 2 years of lib arts at my local CC and then transferring to a 4 year ""real"" school when I decided on which major to study. Would this still be a good idea now or should I focus primarily on CS/IT?

I'm 27, is it too late? (I know it's never too late, but I feel ageism might be a thing, my friends 12 year old brother is learning code in school now, I feel like I won't catch up to this generation).

And final question, I haven't been in a classroom environment in years, what is the best way to adjust to that mindset so I can ease into being a student again after so long?

I transfered to a new college and am considered out of state. When I should be getting 1200 a semester for half time, I am getting like 300. This forced me to take loans out.

This last semester I took 6 units, dropped a class because the structure was fucked up and had only tests and quizzes with no assignments, and thought I'd get a refund so I could add another 3 unit class which is an 8 week course.  I guess I dropped the class 2 days after the official drop date (this college only allows you to drop it after 2 days! while my last college gave you a month!)

I didn't even have enough money to even pay the class for withdrawing which was 700 dollars so I asked my brother to barrow 700 so I could pay the class and add another class. Meanwhile I took out another loan to pay my brother back and have enough money to last me the semester. I can only take out a loan when enrolled with 6 credits.

I took out the loan of  3500 and noticed now I have a charge of 3100 dollars on my account. They say because I ""attempted"" 9 units that I went over the 6 units and am being charged an out of state fee. They are automatically taking out 3100 from my loan leaving me with  400 dollars. Not enough to even pay my brother back and I now he can't even pay the rent and bills. The college assured me I would get this loan and didn't notify me about this ""attempted"" 9 units crap.

I went to the school and pleaded with them my whole situation and they just all reply ""it's policy and there's nothing we can do"". Fucking just destroyed my life and robbed me of thousands of dollars. My family is low income while this college is taking money from someone poor like me. This is criminal behavior and I don't understand how I am expected to know something like this. I don't even have enough money for food now.

I'm American.  I spent a year studying at a public university in my home state -- although public, it is a respected institution and considered one of the better universities in the US.

Well, I wasn't too pleased about staying in my home state nor with how the first year of my studies were going at said public institution.  I wanted something really challenging, so I withdrew from the school so I could attend university in Germany. Since the German and American university systems are so vastly different, I couldn't really ""transfer,"" as there was no ""transfer"" status I could attain at the German university.

So I withdrew from the American university.  In essence, it looks a little like I dropped out.  Well, I am starting my third semester at university in Germany.  I study math and attend one of the best institution for math not only in Germany but also in the world (not at the very top, but the rankings for the university I'm in in mathematics ranks somewhere in the top 30 out of all universities in the world).  However, the program here is challenging -- severely challenging.

Classes are divided into modules, and for each module there is a final exam -- this comprises the grade for the class entirely (no grades from homework, projects, or midterms).  For each module we have three attempts to pass, but each module exam I've taken has at least a 50% failure rate.  I've already failed an exam for one module twice -- I have one more chance within the next 6 months to pass.  If I fail again,  I will be kicked out of university and barred from ever studying mathematics again in Germany -- that's their system!

I haven't failed yet, but I keep thinking about what will happen when I do. If I DO fail out of university, if it's possible, I'd still like to keep studying, but either in Canada or the US.

I know for a fact that US schools do not have a rule where if you fail a program at one school, you can never study that subject at another university ever again.  However, I imagine if I fail it would be extraordinarily difficult for me to be admitted to another university.

Given that I've withdrawn from one school (where I had a pretty decent GPA upon withdrawal, I think it was 3.3) and might fail out of one, is it possible at all for me to be admitted to another university?

I assume admission to a more prestigious institution would be close to impossible.  Is there something I could do in order to make myself more attractive as a candidate?  Even though I fear failing, there is still a lot I've learned at my current university.  I now have a good grasp on Calculus, Linear Algebra, and some higher level mathematical Analysis.

Thanks in advance!

My parents have been saving for my sister and I to go to college since they were in their late 20s. I am privileged enough to have enough money in my college fund that at this point, I could go to school at UCLA for four years and be debt-free. Debt after college is not an issue for me, and I am extremely grateful and know that a majority of people do not have this ability. Because of this freedom, I went to a small art university for animation/architecture right out of high school. I stayed for a semester and a half, got a couple credits. Dropped out and switched to a community college close to where I lived (I burned myself on committing too hard to a school and I was very wary of doing it again). Barely any credits counted as transferrable and my last semester had a lot of F grades.

I've been at this community college for three semesters (on my fourth right now). I had to practically start over in terms of credits, so I'm going to be a junior after this semester is over.

I'm still an art major though - and this is my issue. I don't have a specific path picked out for a focus, and as such I don't actually have future plans or an idea as to what I'm going to do after I get my degree. I am passionate about art, I'm fairly good, and I love doing it, but I've become increasingly stressed and concerned and apathetic about doing it full time or majoring in it. I've found it extremely tough to enjoy classes about art due to their structure, and it's tough to commit myself to classes when I feel as though I should not continue towards art as a major.


Is it too late for me to switch majors? I have a lot of GE credits, should I swap to something else and have a minor in some form of art? 

For those of you who have/know people who have art majors, does having a ""degree in art"" actually DO anything? I've heard that art college is all about networking and work habits and that companies hire artists based on their skills and qualifications for that job, omitting degrees in a lot of senses.

I haven't explored many other majors, regrettably I have not taken any action in branching out or exploring what else I like (for a lot of reasons). Do you have any suggestions as to a major? I am fairly terrible at math, but everything else is fair game to me. I enjoy sciences but do not know anything about the job market or major process for them.

TL;DR - I'm going to be a junior with an art degree and I'm not enjoying it for many reasons. Money is not an issue.

I'm a Chemistry major and just some background to the kind of person I am, in highschool I was the dumbest, laziest, unmotivated fuck in school up until junior year. The counselor stuck me in 3 ap classes, 1 being Ap Chem. I've heard all kinds of things about it and people would laugh at the thought of me attempting the class, let alone Ap. Long story short, I worked my ass off, I failed dozens of times but I learned and grew, I was so successful I raised my gpa up to a 3.9 senior year by getting 4.2-5.0s my last two years, I was the only student to pass the Ap chem test with a 4. I didn't socialize whatsoever and I was pretty much in my room if I wasn't at school. I bought my own gym equipment so I just went to my basement, therefore I had LOADS of time to study and do HW, and I was happy doing just that (at the time). I went straight to college to study chemistry and I also started working at target a month before school. First semester was shit, second was amazing, summer and this past autumn was bad because my girlfriend left me in June and I didn't take it so well.. 

Moving on to now, my GPA is a 2.6 right now and I'm taking Majors OChem 2, Analytical Chem, and calc based physics 2. I was working full time last semester but I knew the semester would be hard and my grades the previous semester weren't so hot so I dropped my lab and hours at work to have 14 credit hours and about 15-20 hours at work. Now this is what I was writing to my Ochem professor,

""I'm not quite even sure how to tell you how I'm feeling but I am absolutely failing the class right now. I've never done this bad before, I've failed and picked myself up, I've grown so much up until this point in my life, and I've done amazing things by being persistent and optimistic no matter what, but I have never been the guy that brings the average down so much it looks scary. Without me, the graphs for the class would look so much more even. And honestly, without saying anything scary, I hope you understand how that makes me feel exactly. I've been working since I came into college, and I've done alright and started to get the hang of it, but apparently cutting my hours in half and being broke all semester isn't enough to be average in your class, and it's too late to put in my two weeks now and try to fix this mess.  I also teach taekwondo classes twice a week here which takes up about 6 hours. I dropped the lab for the semester so I could focus on your class, analytical chem, and physics 1251 but clearly it hasn't helped. There shouldn't be an excuse, I'm sure other students in the class are having it harder. Sir I want to improve and get better but I just don't see it, everyone else is beyond ahead of me and it's extremely difficult to find time for OChem. I stay up til 2-5 every day depending on when my morning class starts and it's all just to finish HW for other classes or rushing to attempt your lecture preps. I mean it takes me almost 1.5-2 hours for your lecture preps, and sometimes I'd feel better off skipping them and using that time to study, I don't know! Of course there are other things in my life that are bothering me and holding me back, but I know you don't care for more excuses. I love chemistry but Organic Chem is uninteresting to me and I honestly can't bring myself to be so passionate about it and passion is what drives me to learn. I'm not sure what to do sir, I'd like advice because I don't want to give up but do you think I should just withdraw? It's not like HS, this will be on my record forever but I'm not sure what to do, I'm willing to work hard but with all my constraints it's difficult"" 

I stopped typing and just figured I come to a place where I could let out how I really feel right now. After my girlfriend left me it took me almost 9 months to get out of depression, and I'm confident she's not in the way anymore for me to grow as a person. I'm interested in a girl right now and she makes me so happy, we have so much in common and we get along so well, she means a lot to me. I know teaching classes, going to the gym, socializing with my friends and all the thinking I have about this girl is taking up so much of my time, but if there's one thing I learned in my life, it's that make sure you're happy, even just a little bit. I honestly almost ended my life 2 times in those 9 months and every single day, the majority of my thoughts were spent thinking about horrible things. I never thought it would end, and then the semester started and I started to pick myself up big time and the girl I like has helped me a bit as well which is why she means a lot to me, it seemed crazy to me. I haven't been this motivated since back in high school when everyone doubted me and I proved them all wrong by becoming one of the top students. I don't want to just cut off my relationship with her, maybe my friends and work, but I can't just cut if off with her and try to talk to her again after like 3 months, I feel like she really likes me and I REALLY like her, I feel like it will ruin the relationship we have right now and possibly just end it.

The problem is I started to fall behind so fast in Ochem and Physics it's scaring me. The first midterm i got a 65/200 and the average was about a 65% but obviously me and a couple other students are outliers so far to the left of the graphs. Like I said in my email, I've failed, I've done bad, but I am consistently getting the LOWEST grade in all my quizzes and midterms. Physics I can fix, but Ochem, there are people getting 110%s and 100s on all the quizzes and midterms. Last semester my professor curved the class so  much I went from a 50% to a B, but that was because I had average/ slightly above average grades. I stay up every day, like I said, usually just trying to finish online HW or lab reports, and that helps me learn, but my classes need so much more time dedicated to learn. I'm trying my best but the reason why I didn't want to email him was because almost every day I'm handed back a quiz that makes me die inside. I'm a science major so I'm used to it, but it's weird, now I'm not average or better. Not even slightly, now I'm the worst score, and it's not because I'm dumb, I know I'm not stupid, but even the stupid kids in the class are doing better because they have the time to do problems and go over as much material as the professor provides them. I only have so much time to do what I can but it's not enough. I've been sad maybe even depressed over my grades before, but this is beyond what I can handle, it's killing me inside, I feel like my life is ruined at this point (sorry if I'm exaggerating)  but I don't want to turn to something else, I want to go into physical therapy or perhaps I do change my mind, the things I'm interested in require a great GPA. I thought about getting my PhD while teaching HS, I don't know, theres so many options, but I want to be something great, and right now I don't see why the girl I like would consider me in the long run if I'm not my greatest. Even if she likes me for who I am, she deserves someone great and I have that potential, I just can't get my shit together. I've done amazing things and I'm hard working, but these classes simply just need time. I'm trying to balance my grades, sleep, work, gym, and social life as best as I can, but If I'm not on top of it all, then I am failing. I have no one to help me except my adviser and I don't have time to talk to him, I don't have time for anything! If I had more time than I did to write this post I'd go see a therapist but I'm just writing this before my next lecture.

I have my next midterm next Monday and I don't have a lot of time this week to catch up, but I'm confident if I study hard from today I will get around average, but I just don't feel like that's enough, what if I fail again? So what if I get average this time? My GPA is still shit, and I just don't see myself doing something amazing like I did in HS with this class, OChem is the most uninteresting thing I've come across in my life. I love chemistry so I'm trying to accept Ochem but I'm not passionate for it.. I can't get any internships or get any nice scholarships because my gpa is disgusting and I'm scared I won't get into any Grad school I want. I went from pharmacy to physical therapy now. I want to be happy, and I want to work the rest of my life doing something that makes me happy and I want to spend it with someone I love. I do a lot of extracurricular, and research is in my mind, getting a Psych minor is too, I have a lot of things in mind, but I feel like none of that will matter if I fail Ochem and I just don't want to consider retaking it, I REALLY want to just pick myself up but at the moment I'm literally the bottom of the barrel in the class. I think the last day to withdraw is coming up so I feel pressured but I don't want to give up! I'm a stubborn guy and it's never threatened me like this before. I want to write so much, I want to go on and on (as if I haven't already) I want to write about everything that bothers me but I think I've said enough, I just want advice, reassurance, anything..

As a High School Senior, I'm really stuck in deciding which college is right for me and if the tuition is worth it. I seek to major in Computer Science as its the only career field I can see myself passionate about. The issue is my desire to both get a decent education while maintaining as low as a student debt as possible. So far I have been accepted to CU Boulder and UO for their programs, as I'm also waiting for my responses for UC Santa Cruz. Both CU Boulder and UCSC are in the top 100 ranked schools for their programs, and are said to be great school to graduate in, as startup companies often recruit newly grads. University Oregon's computer science department is a risk however, as many people say that the curriculum isn't helpful in landing  a job for a newly grad. 

The main issue:
University of Oregon is the cheapest option hovering around 25-30k cost of attendance a year, which may be dropped down perhaps to 20k with scholarships and such. The real bummer is that CU Boulder and UC Santa Cruz (my top choices) are a whopping 40-50k cost of attendance a YEAR(CU Boulder can be chipped away to almost 35k a year with some scholarship;idk about UCSC until my decision is given). From this situation I need some advice; should I accept UO solely in the fact its cheaper, or  invest heavily in CU Boulder or UC Santa Cruz for the better education and the easier opportunity to land a job out of college?",college,Good Program v.

Just for some background, I am a sophomore (19M) at a top 50 university in America. I transferred after my freshman year to this school after not quite fitting in at the first school I attended (and wanting to be closer to home for personal/family reasons). 

I am in my second semester at this school, and I'm still not very happy in college. I like the learning part of it, and have some acquaintances from classes, but I don't have any good friends. My roommates are probably the closest to good friends, and even then it's not real lifelong friendship material. 

Now, I deserve most of the blame. I had joined a club, dropped it because I didn't really like it too much, and haven't really joined anything else. However, the lack of friends/true social life has started to kill my self confidence and has made me even more withdrawn I think. I go home some weekends to wind down from the tense environment at the school and the city, which obviously doesn't help my social life. I just feel lonely and depressed honestly. I stay awake at night just in my bed thinking about how I've screwed up my college experience so far. I also worry about my lack of friends leading to a miserable adulthood with more of the same and never getting married, etc. Everyone else is having a great time (well not everyone, but mostly everyone) and I'm just sitting here thinking about how much I hate it right now.

As I said, I blame myself for most of it. I haven't done a good enough job trying to be social, but my lack of self confidence and happiness is just making it harder and harder to put myself out there. I've always been really shy and quiet, but it's gotten even worse somehow. I guess I just want some advice from people who have been there and got out of it. It's starting to really affect me and my parents are starting to worry I'm not happy (which really increases the pressure, as I don't want them to worry about me being depressed and whatnot). I want to be happy in college. It doesn't have to be the best four years of my life, but I would like for it to not feel like a prison. What do I do? Volunteer? See a counselor to try and regain confidence? Try more clubs that I truly think I would like? It all sounds obvious, doesn't it? Sorry for the long post.

TLDR: I'm not happy in college, mostly due to my lack of friends/social life. Starting to have serious lack of happiness and want to get out of it and enjoy college. What are the next steps?",college,I Suck At College,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/460aso/i_suck_at_college/,1455607931.0

Up until fall quarter I was a strictly A-B student. My GPA around 3.7. Then I developed crippling anxiety and I could not finish out the quarter. My GPA dropped to 3.2 and I failed every class, but one in which I got a C. 

Now, this really pushed back my plans to graduate and I cannot afford another school year in which I pay $35 grand to attend. I decided to transfer to another local school where tuition is $6 grand. But transferring with that bad quarter is making me nervous that I will not be accepted.

I am back in school and doing well, though not my best. I did not feel ready to go back, but with students loans and the funds available to me I did not have much of a choice. I am taking spring quarter off after this. I am hoping to at least get Bs.

I am applying for late withdrawal, which would change all my Fs to Ws. It is still not a great things to have on your transcripts, but better than Fs.

1547,throwmeawaytoopls,1454634599,/r/college/comments/448fkh/motivated_to_turn_it_all_around_now/,"Hey Reddit. Posting this as a throwaway cuz some people know my other username IRL and I'm a bit ashamed to admit all of this.

**Preface:** I'm in my 2nd year of college with 23 hours out of 42 attempted completed. I've dropped 5 of 6 drops allowed. My GPA is 2.27 and I want to major in engineering. I have been in community/junior college my whole college career due to lack of confidence in acceptance of universities with semi-poor performance in high school. (Class rank was top 40%) My SAT score was 1650, scoring 77th percentile in math (610), and 64th percentile in Critical Reading (540). Writing was 56th percentile (500)

&gt;**Preface after the Preface:** I'm just now being medicated for ADHD, and I will (hopefully) be receiving hearing aid help due to enough hearing loss. I already have hearing aids, but they are getting older and getting to a point where they need to be replaced soon. I've been suffering from depression since around junior high and I'm just now getting counseling for that and my anxiety/stress management issues. 

**And now to today.** I am only taking 3 classes with one of them being an 8-week class and the other being a blended course (half online, half in class) with 11 hours total. Calculus, Physics, and Business Management. This is low due to being overwhelmed by stress, anxiety and the lack of focus that I had my previous semesters. 

&gt;Although still early in the semester, my performance is multiple times better than that of my previous 3. I scored a 79% on my first calculus exam and I'm now studying for my next one so I can do much much better and bring my grade up in that class. (Currently an 84%) I know I am capable, I just need to work on the self-discipline and learn how to study efficiently. I come home and immediately knock out any homework I have and then do a few practice problems in both physics and calculus to make sure I stay on top of my studies. I'll finish everything in about 2 - 3 hours and then I have enough time on my hands to make myself extremely bored. To remedy this, I have downloaded a few textbooks and got to reading about my hopeful major, taking in whatever I can. 

In other words, I'm trying to keep myself busy to distract my brain from going to those depressing thoughts. It's extremely helpful and I wish I had done this sooner. I think I can handle one more class on top of the current load I am facing.

I need information that I've been trying really hard to find and it's bothering me a bit. I'm attending a transfer information seminar tomorrow so I might get answers there, but I also want to iron out a few things and see if y'all can help me come up with questions to ask the adviser in regards to my conundrum. 

&gt;First of all... If my semester goes well, and I get all A's, I believe my GPA will come up dramatically to almost a 2.9. The engineering college I want to go to requires a 3.0 to be reviewed, but they recommend higher in order to be competitive. If I take proper courses and get another semester of All A's, I will bring my GPA even higher. I guess what I'm getting at is... I feel like I can recover from my fumbles in my first 3 semesters and prove I am capable. Is it possible that the admissions board will look more at my recent performance than my overall academic record? Also, they state that they include incomplete classes and withdraw/fail classes into the GPA calculation. I'm not sure if my current school does this, so how can I know? This is my biggest concern.

My issue then becomes my academic record of dropping classes. My state (TX) allows at most 6 Q-drops. However, the school I want to transfer into only allows 4 Q-drops. Since I have 5, what will happen? Will they automatically deny my transfer request or will I potentially be able to transfer (given I meet requirements for transfer) and then just not be able to Q-drop a class at all? 

Last, but most definitely not least, I need to know if there is any way my hearing loss can impact my chance for acceptance. I have looked far and wide, but almost everything I've seen about Learning Disabilities refers to those that are much worse off than I am in that regard. I am currently on the state record of having the disability and I am receiving proper accommodations for it. 

WITH ALL OF THIS INFORMATION... What other questions should I raise for the advisers to answer? 

I'm in quite a predicament, but I can dig myself out of it. I tried to format this as best I could in order to make it not so wall-of-texty. But anyways... Are there any recommendations? Should I withdraw after this semester and work for a year and get my head straight or should I keep at it? Is it possible I could get a semester or two completely overlooked somehow?

I'm a year out of school; I feel better now. I haven't been partying (as much) and have kept myself under control, exercising and reading.

I could use some help here. I'm attempting to implement a long term plan I've had in mind for a while, but I'm at the proverbial Square 1 and not sure where to go from here. I'm a 28-year-old male, a U.S.-resident, and I'm 1-2 semesters away from an Associate's in Computer Science at my local community college.

Briefly: I joined the military out of high school instead of going to college because I was all but certain I would flunk out. I still think that was the right decision. Hunkering down and forcing myself to get a degree might have been the rational choice (and I realized that, even then), but I also knew that rational thought was not what ruled my mind at that age. The moment I didn't WANT to do it, and without a backlog of ""Excellent Reasons to Stick With It"", which age has so graciously provided, I would have dropped it at the first sign of adversity. But even so, I've always felt I have a scholar in my heart. I have a thirst for knowledge and a passion for understanding, and in certain seasons of mind that passion borders on obsessiveness. I mention these details so you'll understand that I have a solid foundation for making this plan and asking these questions.

After all this time, and going back to school, and working (and observing the contrast between the business life and the academic life), I've realized, resolutely, that I can study and I want to study. I am willing to trade my life for learning, in essence. It's the best thing I've found and I've tried a few things. So, that said, my goal is to forge some sort of concrete plan that will allow me to study, essentially as a career. I know where I want to go concerning a specific field as well, but I think that's a bit outside the purview of this post. Suffice to say I'd like to study in the direction of the life sciences, ideally something relating to neuroscience. The tricky part is: I do not have any idea, whatsoever, how objectively to begin this search. It's not really something you can just Google, and to be honest I wouldn't know who to talk to (or whether I can really trust them, honestly) at any local schools.

I should mention I'm not opposed to relocating, including abroad. I'm married and my wife is from Moscow originally, so Europe is actually a welcome option for us. Speaking of Europe, I've heard rumors of certain states offering incredible options for studying with them. Norway? Germany?

TL;DR -- Older student looking to study seriously; looking for the best options in the world to make that happen.

One last thing. Is there a more appropriate subreddit (or any forum, really) for this topic? I'm posting this in all the pertinent subs I can find, but I'm sure there are other places. Thank you sincerely for any feedback.

I have several years of web development experience. I took this art program because it sounded like it would give me more job opportunities for web programming than computer science, as it sounded much more focused on web (hey it seemed like a good idea at the time).

My resume says ""BFA in Electronic Visualization"" and some contacts have told me they can't figure out what it really is. To make things worse, though, the university no longer offers that concentration. When I graduated in late 2007, some of the art college departments were in flux, especially for the classes teaching the more computer-oriented classes which is understandable, that technology changes quickly. It covered topics like web programming, mobile application design, and 3D animation. It was a very small school, with about 20 people in each class, and I saw almost the same people in each class. It was also very insular. Job fairs did not cater to Electronic Visualizers and in hindsight I should have picked CS because far more programming jobs and internships were targeted for them. I have never interned for any companies, and I only got offers from crappy startups, but what's done is done.

So sometime after that, the College of Art dropped the Electronic Visualization concentration and eventually split into ""Art"" and ""Design"" schools. ""Design"" got Graphic Design and Industrial Design, and ""Art"" got the rest. I recently looked at their course programs and they have something that didn't have when I graduated: New Media.

A lil about me and my background so you can see where i came from and how this can work for anyone. I dropped out of high school and never went to college. I got my GED and worked in sales for 10 years. I hated it and always wanted to work in IT but didn't have the money or time for a tech school or college. I found out that alot of entry level IT jobs will take you with just certifications and you can just pay about 250 to take the test and that's it. so i did some research and found quite a few tools that are helpful in self studying i wanted to share.


Please understand that there are many ways to take to get into IT and many different types of jobs in IT. This route in particular is to become a network administrator, this is the path that I took. 

**Im not here to argue about the merits of college Vs. certifications, so please do not bother.**


Like i said before I had a background in sales and customer service prior to working in IT. This greatly helped me get into my first help desk position because i already had many skill sets that were pertinent to the position like phone etiquette and **PATIENCE**. If you plan on getting a job in a help desk environment i highly suggest starting with a simple customer service job while you are starting work on your studies.


Also, I showed this to a co worker of mine who went down a similar path and he told me about the WIA grant which is a government grant that pretty much anyone that is unemployed or making less than like 17k a year can qualify for. It gives you 12 thousand dollars in grant money that you can use at places like mycomputercareer.com (i dont recommend using them, that was just an example)

**Comptia A+ certification.**

https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/a 

This certification is focused on basic knowledge on both PC hardware and software. This is your starting point for even those of you that cant do much more than basic use. Even if you dont want to work in IT this is still a great way to learn the ins and outs of a PC just for personal use. It is broken up into two tests. The first is a test on hardware. It tests your general knowledge about pc hardware like what a motherboard is, it may have a picture of a motherboard and have you label what each part is, common TCP ports, etc. The website has a breakdown of all the info they are testing you on.

**www.professormessor.com**

 Start studying here. His videos are 100% free and he is amazing at breaking down the information and making it easy to understand. After each video there are 3 or 4 questions. Answer them and if you fail watch the video again.

**www.examcompass.com**

After you feel you have finished the videos go here to test your knowledge. A general rule of thumb is once you can get a 90 on each section you should be ready for the test.

**www.techexams.net**

The forum on this site has alot of really helpful people and is a great tool while studying.

**www.vue.com**

Once your ready to take the test go to pearson vue's website to find a testing center, schedule your test, and pay for it.

**get a entry level helpdesk job** 

After you have achieved your Comptia A+ certification you should look for entry level helpdesk/tech support work. This is all about building experience for your resume. These jobs typically pay around 15 an hour or so but can pay more depending on where you live and what type of work your doing. My first IT job was a helpdesk position and it started at $42k which is $20 an hour.


Now you need to decide where you want to go in IT. This guide will focus on the network\hardware side of things which is typically working on any of the hardware related issues anywhere from setting up workstations to working on routers and switches.
Some people stick with Comptia from here and get their Comptia N+. This is comptia's networking certificate. To do this follow the same steps as the A+ above just study the N+ info.
Alot of people find the N+ unecessary and go right into Cisco certification. This is what i did, a cisco cert makes the N+ pretty pointless as it is more advanced.

From here on we will be discussing Cisco certs.

**Cisco CCNA**

Cisco certification is alot harder than comptia. The cisco CCNA is said to have a less than 20% pass rate. Its the only cert test i ever failed and had to retake (failing sucks hard because you have to pay those fees again)

The first cisco certification is the Cisco CCNA or CCENT.
When taking the first cisco certification you have two options. you can either take 1 test which covers all the material, or you can take 2 tests which splits the material in half. I highly suggest taking the split test because there is ALOT of information to cover. The split test still gives you a CCENT certificate for completing the first test. Just make sure if you go this route to not stop until you have your CCNA because recruiters will ask you about it if you have a CCENT.

For studying I highly suggest using Jeremy Ciora's CBT nuggets he is an amazing instructor 

https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/cisco-training

It does come at a cost (if your ok with pirating you can bittorent his videos.)

You also need to use a program to simulate routing and switching. I recommend packet tracer as its what i used. You need to become completely familiar with the Cisco IOS using this. Just google packet tracer you should be able to find a free download with little effort.

Once you feel comfortable with your knowledge schedule your test over at vue.com

After achieving your CCNA and having a year or two experience you should start looking for a better job as a network administrator. These typically pay somewhere on average around 60k in the us but vary wildly.

Good luck and if you have any questions hit me up!

1553,HalThrowaway1,1453707193,/r/college/comments/42k9pl/is_there_any_point_in_staying_in_majorrelated/,"I'm currently majoring in IT in community college, and I've had a rough time over the last few years with school in general. Been through a few majors, been in and out of school here and there for various reasons, and I'm at a point in my life where I'm just not sure what I want to do or who I want to be. I don't want to stay in IT and have already dropped to 2 of the 4 classes I started two weeks ago, because between work and family and sleep and everything that goes on, there's just not a lot of time for quality schoolwork or studying.

The two classes that are left are ones I'm thinking of dropping, and just taking this semester off while I reevaluate where I want to go in life. One is major-specific to IT, and one is applicable to a good sized amount of degrees, but I believe I've narrowed my choice down to a few, and none require it.

Is there really a point to staying in these classes? Between not having much time to focus on school right now and not knowing where I want to go from here, it's dragging what work I am doing down, and as the load gets more intense and exams and all that start showing up down the road, I feel like it's only going to get worse.

Honestly, I really need some advice.  I'm twenty-one years old and have an awkward history with two colleges so far that I believe will prevent me from getting into another college.  After I graduated high school I moved in with my parents.  I first went to a state college nearby to start taking pre-major, basic college classes.  I went there for a year and didn't do well, primarily because I didn't take my classes seriously.  A childish mistake, I know.  The next year I'd transferred to a private school half-way across the country.  I was suffering from depression at the time.  Well, more so than now.  I thought that if I forced myself into a situation where I didn't have family to rely on, where I was living in a dorm that I was going into debt to pay for, that would motivate me to do better.  I performed worse, missed classed, and failed two classes.  Before it was too late, I dropped out, one semester in.  Needless to say, I was a wreck for a while.  For the past year and a month I've been working on coping with my depression and learning to live with it as positively as I can.  I've made some good progress, but that doesn't change my mistakes and awkward educational situation.  However, my most recent school, the private school, is holding my transcripts until I pay off the $10,000 I owe them (after loans and grants).  Now I'm trying to apply to take online classes at UA, and I'm completely uncertain whether or not I can actually apply anywhere.  Is it legal for me to not list that school as one that I've attended?  Can I request my first college to send transcripts instead?  Even better, is it possible to ""start fresh"" (since my grades weren't great there either and I'm starting from scratch) by sending them my ACT and highschool transcript?  I can't seem to find anywhere else online where people have been in a very similar situation.  That's why I'm asking you all.  Help me, internet.  You're my only hope.",college,I'm In A Uniquely Terrible Situation,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/40ub0u/im_in_a_uniquely_terrible_situation/,1452739276.0
1556,FirstThrowawayOf2016,1452079732,/r/college/comments/3zpf01/theres_a_95_chance_ive_flunked_out_college/,"Hey everyone, I've made this throwaway because I felt the need to talk about some dumbass choices I've made during and for this previous semester. First, I'm going to start with a little background.

I've just turned 21 and I've been working with some levels of depression and anxiety in the last couple of years. It was certainly at its worse when I was 17, but it's gotten to a more stable level in one sense where I'm not working through panic attacks and suicidal thoughts, but in another unstable sense it's affecting my current work ethic where I've been prone to states of concentration loss and easily forgetting things. Sometimes I feel like that last part may be an excuse but I don't see what else could be the reason for these lapses I've been working through.

Anyway, so with these factors in play, I'm going to talk a bit more about this semester. I just transferred in a year ago to this 4 year college after receiving my associates degree from a local community college. Now, I've always been very nonchalant when it comes to school (That sounds bad already, huh) because while I'm the type to thoroughly study through something once my interest is piqued, I've had bad experiences in previous schooling that's caused me to keep myself involved in school from an emotional distance. It's almost comical in a sense that my interest slips once the subject is presented in a classroom setting, but it's suddenly worth spending hours on the internet over once I discover it myself. I also have a terrible track record with getting small homework assignments done, mainly because I've found them to be nothing short of draining and time sapping. It's a bit of an oxymoron when I'm more liable to write a long paper for a course but I need to be pushed to do a 10 question fill in sheet. Of course, this trend has followed me in a bad sense where I've been under-prepared in classes for pop quizzes or tests. 

This trend has really screwed me this semester since this was the bane of every class that I had enrolled in. I've done (and still currently doing) an internship this semester at a nearby non-for-profit, and there was a constant stream of tedious homework assignments that I would rarely get done. To top it off, I chose a roster of classes in a bunch of extensive, different topics that really strained me to keep my focus intact while dealing with the issues I mentioned above. Here's the kicker: Because of a late grade entered in my previous semester along with doing horrible in one of my worst subjects (Foreign Language), I was automatically placed under academic probation from the College's automatic bot, and there was no leeway for me to reason with the deans/counselors of my college due to a lack of proof that I did not hand in an assignment late. 

I finished this semester the best that I could with the time I had available to me, and a lot of effort put into getting the best grades that I could for my final exams. Because of my homework discrepancy, and because of unpredictable personal matters this semester (Loss of a family member, another family member had cancer which put a strain on the household), I am now LITERALLY .075 points below the threshold to be within the college's official minimum GPA tolerance. I've emailed my professors explaining the situational circumstances in a bid to do anything to get just a couple more points onto my grade to help recover that .075, but it seems very likely that I'm going to be kicked out of the college, and lose 28 credits that I've taken towards my bachelors.

Now, the fortunate/blessed parts? My mother and father are being understanding after explaining the issue of concentration with them (They've mentioned that they've noticed it in my day-to-day behaviors), I've been reconsidering my major as of late (Psychology is interesting but I'm not sure if this is something I want to major in any longer due to job security), and I honestly feel much happier working in a job setting instead of a school setting. I'm glad that I have my associates degree, so going back to school will start with 60 credits at the very least.

The actual bad parts? The feeling of letting down my parents and wasting their money that helped pay for my schooling, the self-inflicted let down that I've actually been kicked out from an academic institution, and the feeling of shame once certain friends catch on to what's happened to me. I'm probably just going to say that I'm taking some time off from school, but even then, that feels a bit embarrassing for me. 

As far as what now, I've become interested in the idea of learning computer science (programming) and I've spent the last couple of days utilizing whatever resources are available for free; Codecademy certainly hasn't been treating me wrong. I'm also going to try to grab a job, hopefully something like a bank where I'll be paid enough to keep steady and help pay for bills, etc.

Anyway, I wrote this on this subreddit for a reason. I want to use my current story as another read for a redditor that may be struggling with mental health issues, stuck in the contemplative phase after noticing bad school habits, or is even unsure as to whether they'll be able to handle a schedule with a wide variety of intensive courses. 
I took this semester thinking that I will be able to have this all under control and lift the probation status off my record as if it was never there. However, because I didn't work through my own inherent problem towards ""pesky homework assignments"", consider my current ability to concentrate on school studies, plan my schedule accordingly to work harmoniously in the intensive subject matters I was studying, or even consider to give myself enough time to do all of this because I thought I could do an internship as well, I am now probably going to be dropped from my college because of .075 points, with the only possible way to remain enrolled is through a professor feeling generous enough to help me out, or through a special review process through the Dean's office if they'll even give me that.

If you're dealing with something or you're aware of a certain problem, give yourself room to work with. Whether it's scheduling, a constant mood/thought process, certain things happening in life, a lack of push to fix an inherent problem: just give yourself room to work with. I feel that I certainly did not handle things correctly this way, and I really hope that the next time I'm pursuing my bachelors degree, I will have everything in check and do it right that time around.

This lead to my eventual drop from the university and i felt like complete poo. I sat out for 3 years, 3 freaking years. Every year I sat out I tried to reapply to get back in, but i kept getting rejected. Anyway, this past summer I was finally accepted and took two classes and ended up with a 4.0 so they allowed me to continue for the fall. Before the fall semester started, I signed an appeal form stating i would get my cumulative back to a 2.0 by the end of Spring 2016, so I could keep my financial aid and all that. Well a few days ago I got an email saying I have been placed on scholastic drop from the university for the next year. I wont lie, I was pretty rusty this semester and trying to get back in the groove, but I did well in my core classes. My elective classes are what screwed me over so my GPA for the semester was under their minimum and they dropped me. I had no clue about about the minimum semester requirement, but I guess that has no weight in my argument. I honestly thought I was bound by the appeal form I signed, which was to get to the 2.0 by the end of Spring 2016. Ive tried talking to my counselors in my college, but they all stick to the script and say theres nothing I can do. Although, one counselor said I could come back for the summer. I really cant afford to miss any more school, as Ive already sat out for 3 years and I have a kid on the way, so finishing as soon as possible is important to me. The counselors dont seem to care about my situation at all. Ive gotten an A/B in all my core classes to get into my actual college, its just my electives that have screwed me over. In just the summer and fall, ive raised my GPA from a .67 to a 1.92.

1558,MyersEric13,1450933880,/r/college/comments/3y1tir/transfer_questionopinions/,"So as of last week I finished my first semester of community college, I haven't been to a school/college since I graduated from HS in 6/2009.  When I started the semester back in August I had zero intention of transferring to a four year university/college, now I'm starting to rethink that idea.  

I took two business classes (Intro to Business, and Business Law) one computer networking class and dropped two weeks into beginning digital photography (been a freelance photographer for 6 years now and didn't feel like taking a 5 hour a week beginner course) After the semester was all said and done I ended up with a 3.0 GPA which was honestly higher than I thought I would've had.

So, I have a couple questions and looking for opinions from people that have been in my position.  As of right now I'm currently signed up for four more business classes (Business Comm, Management, Management leadership online, and HR online) 

Should I drop the two online classes and take two core classes to get that out of the way if/when I transfer to a four year?  Also, since I've been out of high school for what will be 7 years this upcoming year do I still have to take the ACT/SAT?  I've read a lot of conflicting stories where colleges won't look at the ACT/SAT scores due to being out of school for that long.


TL;DR enjoyed first semester, thinking of transferring now when I wasn't before, do I take core classes or business, is SAT/ACT necessary for someone that's been out of high school for 7+ years and thinking of transferring to four year.

Let's clear things up first. I am not depressed and my parents are not abusive. I'm just really bored with my life right now and I want to do something different. There are several train tracks near my neighborhood and I was planning on hopping a freight and living on the road for a few days. 

""But what about the school that you miss. Your grades will suffer?""

Yeah, I got that covered. There's only 3 days left in the semester and I have solid grades in all of my classes. There are no tests left in any of them and I can afford to take zeroes on the remaining assignments. My school does have a policy where if you have more than 5 unexcused absences in a semester for a class, you get dropped a letter grade. But the thing is, there's only 3 days left in the semester and so this wouldn't affect me. 

I've hopped trains before, so I probably won't get hurt in the process of getting on/off the trains. If anything, I would be worried about food. But I have saved up a lot of money and I was planning on carrying plenty of food on me. I don't really know where the train goes, but I know it passes through a state where I have a close friend in. If needed, I could always have him pick me up, and I could hitch hike too. 

I will try to keep this as much of a secret from everybody as possible. I know train-hopping is illegal, but if they don't see me, how would they ever find out? Would having a string of unexcused absences from school would raise some red flags? If I do get caught freight-hopping, is it a serious enough of a crime for them to revoke their admissions?

I am 21 years old, I have been in community college for 4 years now. My first major was computer science, after failing coding, i decided to change my major. I am now business admin. I changed my major last fall semester and planned to graduate by this spring. I went through a couple of obstacles during this time period. My father was really ill, I was dealing with a bad breakup (Which ended up being better for me in the long run) and I just couldnt seem to get my ass on fire to focus. My parents are extremely hard working, as they have dropped everything to work 15 hours days for my sisters and i. My sisters are the ideal daughters that are successful or on their way to success. MY little sister is extremely hard working and so intelligent. My older sister is studying hard for her nclex, and my oldest sister is a PA. I feel as though i am the child that makes my parents not sleep at night. Although we are not the wealthest people in the world, my parents never let me work because they wanted me to focus on school. My sisters around me felt i was taking advantage of their money, and this summer i started working. I worked at a bagger at a supermarket, and i absoluely hate it. I hate the people, i hate the managers, i hate the enviironment. This made me realize i have to work my ass off to make sure i dont end up doing smething i hate. especially when i have education as a main resource. I paid for my whole bill myself (which was hard bc every paycheck was spent for school) but i worked like ive never worked before. My parents began to tell me they see a difference in me, my sisters started to as well. I disappeared from the face of the planet. I lost all contact with my friends, I barely spent time watching tv and hanging out with my family (bc we are really close knit so we spent alot of time together), i was barely on social media, i didnt have any interest in boys or makeup or looking nice. I would literally go to class, take hardcore notes, understand the material, come home, clean up, take care of my dad and then start on homework and studying material learned. My grades for the first time were actaully good. I had an 80 in econ 2, 80 in accting 1, 83 in business stat and 100 in eng. I knew i had to work my ass off to recieve my b's in the classes. I didnt sleep for 9 days, i stayed up studied, allotted enough time. On the day of exams, i went in with a positive attitude. I knew i could do it. I knew how many points i needed to get a b, and how many i needed to get a c. If getting a b was too extreme, i could atleast get a c. For my accting exam, i needed to get a 120/200. for my econ exam i needed to get 80/125. ALL I NEEDED WERE D's. i went in positive but for my accting exam, i was rushed. i thought i got atleast 120.. today i went to check my grade to find out i got 101/200.. i received a D. my heart sunk. for econ i received a 56% on the final. MY heart sunk again bc i received a D. I thought the worst i was going to get was going to be a C. I dont know whatts wrong with me.

1562,beluganarwhalmutant,1450119680,/r/college/comments/3wti85/medical_leave_for_almost_four_years_how_to_go/,"**FYI, LONG story, as there is quite a bit to be said in order to paint the full picture.**

I had a rough time socially in middle and high school, to the point where I invested the majority of time into academics because it was the only place where I felt valued. After a harsh college application experience (as my dad had been out of a stable job for at least a year), I got into Brown U. in the spring of 2010 with an academic scholarship that covered 4/5 of the total cost. I was also accepted into Santa Clara U. with a full ride, but turned it down because I lived nearby and wanted to escape the area that I associated with a lonely and stifling adolescence.

Though I was ecstatic to be offered such a great opportunity, my excitement quickly dwindled as I started fearing the ramifications of starting college. I had little idea of what I wanted to do at Brown, much less study. To be honest, I had little idea of why I even *wanted* to go to college - there was not much more impetus there than the threat of having to resort to a low-wage job to survive if I chose otherwise. In fact, I applied to Brown on a whim, just because my friend at school thought it might be a good fit for me. In any case, reading the many threads on the Brown '14 Facebook page did little to ameliorate my anxiety in the preceding months. The opposite happened, and it only worsened with each incoming email, ""Congratulations!"", welcome, and farewell. 

One of the few things I *did* do in advance was register for a pre-orientation program for first-years, geared towards minorities but open to all. I still remember the tension in my body and the dread in the pit of my stomach as the day approached, and it amplified during my flight to Rhode Island and the day before the beginning of the program, when I was staying at a hotel in downtown Providence. The night before, I broke down and wished I could just go home. My mom, who had accompanied me, urged me to at least go and try. Try it out, and then I could decide whether to leave or not. So I did.

It wasn't as horrible as I had anticipated, but I felt like an impostor among the other attendees. I forced myself to go to some of the social events, where I met a few people and eventually formed a group (which I would be most familiar with for the next three semesters). They were cool, funny and interesting people with diverse backgrounds, and then there was me. I honestly felt I had little to contribute, and that I was outmatched by people in my classes. Because, really, compared to everyone else, I was a chubby spectacled spaz with little social grace, shitty fashion sense, no real direction, etc. You get the picture. I was an alien who had crash-landed by chance in a community of prime human beings.

This constant, rarely unwavering stream of thoughts and beliefs festered in my already overwhelmed mind, giving rise to relentless self-deprecation and outright phobia. The fall of 2010 (Semester I), it was understandable I feel flimsy, but the house of cards shook ever more intensely the following spring, where I dropped Gen Chem for the second time and during when my self-loathing and hopelessness manifested as skipping class, half-assing assignments, avoiding most forms of contact, and shutting myself in my room with the Internet to keep me company. 

After I found out I was on academic warning in the summer of 2011, I vowed I would work harder to make up for it. So I took five courses (the maximum workload for one semester at Brown), not including two science labs, in the fall of sophomore year. As my mental stability slowly crumbled, I started making visits to Psychological Services to talk about my issues with a shrink. It helped to tell someone, but I felt I was in quicksand and any effort to escape was causing me to sink faster. Yet I kept it bottled up inside me. It was in this period that I began to contemplate suicide. In this time, I also signed up with a medical brigade club on campus that was planning a trip to Ecuador over winter break. As the semester came to a close, my decision to kill myself was compounded by the fact that I had taken gen chem for the third time and completed the final, despite having done poorly on all the exams and being certain I would fail it. (A week later, I learned I ended up with a C - a miracle considering I had tanked on all other assignments. Goodbye, medical school!) My confidence shot to shit, I felt darkness surround me. I did my best to enjoy my week in Ecuador, not ready to face the return.

(**Now for the climax.**) We flew back into Boston, took the train to Providence, and went our own ways upon arrival. I entered my single and remained cooped up in there for the next few days. No food, little sleep. Then the day before spring courses began arrived, and I had yet to register for any. I also had to declare a major, which I had long since abandoned investment in. Trapped in a corner, my mind searched for ways to end it. Jumping off the top of the Sciences Library. Throwing myself in the path of a train. Provoking a police officer into firing at me on purpose. I went to the roof of another building, but couldn't muster the energy to jump. My being was throttled of life force and will, to the point where I could not even find an urge to careen off the top. Beyond distraught, I went to Psych Services, who urgently escorted me to the mental ward at a nearby hospital. My mom came to visit me. I was there for more than a week, through my birthday, with a bunch of other broken people, before I was released. The following day, one of the University deans sat with us in her office and requested I went on medical leave, which I obliged.

All of 2012 was misery back home in California. I chipped away at surface-level problems, but the black core of my despair remained intact. My shrink was no help, and ultimately made things worse when she signed my papers for medical readmission, which I was granted by the University. I was back at Brown for perhaps two and a half weeks starting at the end of January '13. While I was working to keep myself occupied, the distorted thinking and thoughts of self-destruction were not far away. I spoke what was really on my mind nonchalantly to the Dean during a check-up, which prompted her to quickly arrange another internment at the same ward from the year before. My mom crossed the country within a day to visit and keep me company. A blizzard kept us from exiting the building from recreation. If it wasn't for my mom, I would have gone bonkers. The Dean visited the next week and extended my leave, after which I returned home.

I've been here since then, February '13. I attended a local community college, where I had a perfect academic record - at least until I started going to the smoking area out of sheer loneliness. There I became slowly hooked into smoking weed and cigarettes, to the point where I would blow through two packs a day on my own. I spent a LOT of money on weed. My company were, in retrospect, troubled individuals as well; they drove me to do shit I felt was out of character but did anyway because I had lost my self-respect years prior. I applied for medical readmission again in the spring of 2014, but a week before they were to give me a decision, I did a very stupid thing. I fucking wrote I was going to kill myself - ON FACEBOOK. This impulsive, thoughtless action was triggered by seeing the graduation photos of the Class of '14 - the very people I had begun college with. They had finished, while I *felt* finished. Needless to say, after numerous calls from concerned individuals and a visit to my house from the police, the decision that I would not be readmitted was made. About the only thing I enjoyed from 2014 was the World Cup... in this year, I had also worked two separate jobs, which I quit both times because I felt I would be stuck there forever, with no future but endless shifts. Not exactly the best way to stitch together a resume.

The first few months of 2015 were much of the same, where I spent a great deal of time with ""friends"", aka poor saps who wanted a weed buddy or punks who used me as an emotional and verbal punching bag. Of more than a dozen attempted courses at community college, I completed only two. I got angry. VERY angry. I cut off those leeches and began to consider my life, where everything had gone wrong. There were no easy answers, or solutions. In the summer of this year, I visited my family in Argentina (I was born there). During this time, I connected with the stark reality of life in another corner of the world, which was dealt with in a lighthearted fashion by most of those I encountered. Here, I went through the weed/tobacco withdrawal, tried a lot of genuinely good food, improved my Spanish dramatically, and explored the city with my family members. I couldn't remember the last time I had gone out with people who were not apt to judge or belittle me. When I returned in late August, I felt a great rush of emotion. In this moment, I genuinely wept for the first time in forever. 

Although my spirit had been briefly charmed, my internal turmoil had periodic episodes of resurgence. In the spring, I applied yet again for readmission, which was turned down, with the strong recommendation that I take courses at a nearby four-year for eventual transfer credit. So I signed up at UC Berkeley. I didn't return to the States until the second week of classes, however, and found it hard to motivate myself to work. My greatest effort was a three-day ordeal to read and learn many pages of organic chemistry for the first exam, which I pulled a 96 on. Regardless, discouraged by my terrible study habits and total absence of focus/interest/desire/god-only-knows, I dropped them one by one. I stuck it out in Ochem lab, but I lost the drive to navigate through the material, and dropped it as well, a day before the final. That was last Wednesday, six days ago.

Since the second hospitalization, I've been seeing a psychiatrist and psychologist at Stanford Hospital. Their good intentions come up short, as I realize only I can truly solve my own problems. I am *still* reluctant to see my shrink, and though I feel empowered after spilling my guts to him and having him empathize and offer a plan of action, it evaporates soon after. I take a heavy dose of antidepressants, and have tried quite a bunch - at best, these have kept me in a sedative state, with no angst but not much of anything else either. At worst, I developed a voracious appetite and packed on the fat, on top of losing virtually all sexual drive and turning my member into nothing more than an exit valve for urine. As if that wasn't enough, my 23rd birthday is in February and I sense that time is encroaching on me quickly. My few friends are off living their lives, my parents are losing their patience, and the days have blurred into stagnant periods of sunlight interspersed with quiet darkness, which closely matches my general gloom.

If you read all the way to the end, I applaud you. I have not told any one human the entirety of this experience, not anyone at Brown, not the shrink, not my family nor my friends. I fear if I do, I will lose the little support I have left from them. That's why Reddit is awesome - because I can tell complete strangers with no investment in me whatsoever! What do I really want? To enjoy my time alive, to be interested and invested in something with uncanny fervor. And to **finish college**, if for nothing more than to use that as a symbol of my ultimate victory over my own capacity to self-sabotage.

**TL;DR: lonely boy becomes lonely college student, becomes mental college student, becomes mental case, and now wants to become something more.**

This may be a little venting as well but I just feel the need to drop this university and go to a different school.

Ok. I was in a community college first and than I transfered to a university. First semester went great. Got A's. However there was a problem with my first semester. My advisor (im a math major) wanted me in 2 math courses and 1 core class. Well she never took the hold off my account to register and the 2 math courses were full. So I got stuck taking 2 core classes. No math. Next semester (current) I am taking 3 courses. 2 math, 1 language. Semester is going ok but I did drop 1 math course. Honestly I slacked off in that class but my fault I admit. Anyways I had my professor sign my drop sheet and turned it in. When it came to meeting the math advisor it showed that SHE never dropped it. It took a couple of hours for her to fix it since it now showed I was a no show. I was annoyed but got over it. Anyways I went to see her on the 5th of Nov. She told me that she scheduled my 2 math courses and I would have to pick my computer class time and day. Well today I found out she never registered my classes nor did she take off my hold for the semester to registered. I called her office and of course, she's on leave. I called to complain. They took the hold off and told me that the two classes I was wait listed would not add anymore students. So no math courses AGAIN.

1565,yliaste,1448933140,/r/college/comments/3uxojw/failed_3_semesters_of_college_due_to_depression/,"Hello Reddit, I need your advice.

Two years ago I fell into a quite deep state of depression, so I dropped out of college, only to come back and failed all my classes because I couldn't find the strength in me to get out of bed in the morning to go to school. I was always either crying or sleeping all day, and lying awake at night staring at the ceiling and cry some more. However I didn't manage to drop out in time so the ugly grades stayed in my transcript. The same thing happened the next semester, and the semester after that. I was in a dark place.

I'm doing better now because I had help from my friends (god bless them, by the way). I found a job, and I went back to school again and am doing quite good. I tried to apply to a full-time program next semester but got rejected because of my failures in the past. My R-Score (the equivalent of a GPA) is ridiculously low because of that. I know I can raise it quite a bit with this semester's grades, but I can't apply until next year. I'm already 20 years old and I don't want to waste any more time. 

Moreover, I'm only allowed 3 free consecutive semesters of part-time studies. After that, I'd have to pay the full fee for my classes. I could apply to another college so that it'd be free, but it'd be hard adjusting.

What should I do? Is it possible to change what's written on my transcript or is it too late? I'm planning to get into Computer Science in University but I honestly don't know if I can make it.

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.",college,"Failed 3 semesters of college due to depression, what now?",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3uxojw/failed_3_semesters_of_college_due_to_depression/,1448951140.0

I'm so close to failing the only two classes I'm taking this semester. I have a 56% in NSCI (Natural Science) and a 63% in MATH 080 (Basic fucking math). I've never been good in school. In elementary school, my mother hid my grades from me. How could I improve if I didn't know how horrible I was doing? I passed with a D in almost everything. Getting a C or B was something for me to be proud of. I have horrible work ethic. I'm just happy I have a job and am doing good in that. Anyway, I digress. I dropped out of high school, spent the rest of the winter participating in out-patient (where suicidal kids go who just complain about wanting to die but don't actually attempt to) and claiming I was going to be a tattoo artist and live off that (On another note, I'm an artist and a musician and want to go to Columbia in Chicago, IL). I' moving very slowly in college right now, taking 1 or 2 classes a semester. Yea. Just reading that to myself, my heart dropped into my stomach. The only thing fortunate for me right now is the fact that the rest of my career here at community college, I'll be taking art classes. I DO NOT have the choice to fuck those up. This is my career we're talking about. As far as Columbia goes, there are no prerequisites. Of course having a portfolio is going to help a bunch - and that's where art classes come in. I want to take 4 a semester but I know I can't do it so I'll take 3. This is my one and only salvation. If I can just do really good in these classes that will benefit my future and then get the fuck out of here and get accepted, I'll be a VERY happy man. But there are two thoughts that PLAGUE my mind, day in and day out. 
1. If I fail these two classes, will my parents refuse to pay for anymore classes
2. If my parents won't pay for my classes, financial aid won't pay for them because of my recent grades.
1 + 2 = No successful future in sight, which in turn equals probable game over.
ANOTHER problem to eat away at my soul: I spend a lot of time with my gf. She's going to be staying in town when she gets out of community college. She's 1 year younger than I am and has 1 semester to go before moving on to better things. Anyway, I'll be in Chicago and she'll be here, 3 hours away form each other. I don't believe long distance relationships work but we've been together for two years now and love each other very much. I really hope the distance won't get the better of us. So yea. School is eating my alive. It's my fault, I won't deny it. But I just really wish it didn't have to be this way. I wish I could be a harder worker.

1568,Noxiide,1447662665,/r/college/comments/3t00sg/welllooks_like_im_going_to_get_my_first_d_in/,"Last year didn't go so well, had trouble adjusting to college and being away from home. Ended up getting like a 2.8 first semester. Started to rally at the end, but then my dad was injured in an accident and it kinda fucked up my end of the year, including exams. Would have had a 3.0 or higher, but got a D on my final exam in math, and dropped down to a C in that class instead of a B+. Next semester, simply didn't do very well, and ended the year with a 2.7 GPA. This is after coming out of High School with High Honors, so this was pretty disappointing.

This semester, I thought I'd change it all around. One of my classes I have a B+ in, two a B- that I've brought up and are coming up on being B's. One class I have no clue what I have in it, cause none of the grades are online.

However, I had to take online accounting as one of my classes this semester. I didn't enroll in time for the in class accounting. On ratemyprofessor, all the reviews said it was hard as hell and not to take it, and to take the in class one instead. Well, I had no choice. 

It wasn't even me being a dumbass, well, it sort of was. I'm pretty much behind by about 150 points because I was too lazy and didn't do a lot of the homework, because it takes long as fuck and I hate accounting, and since it's self taught I have to spend three hours just learning the shit before I can even start on it. I always do the homework on Sunday because I work on weekdays and have other classes. But now, the class is out of a 1000 points. I thought for some reason, that the final was worth 300 points. So I wasn't feeling too bad about my 497 out of 700, because I figured I'd still pull out a C. But today I looked at the syllabus again, and I misread it. The final is actually 200 points. I have 505 points in the class. For some reason it looks like 42 points are missing somewhere, because right now it says the class is only out of 758. I hope those 42 points show up, because I could really use them if I want to salvage a C- out of this. 

But, if it ends up staying like this, odds are I get a B or C on the exam, considering that the two midterms had averages of 61% and were not curved. I scored above the average both times, but doesn't really matter at this point because I pretty much pissed away half of my homework points. Fuck I mean even a D- is in the realm of possibilities. 

Anyways...no real point to this. Just wanted to write it out I guess. Feeling like a pretty big fuck up at this point. Guess I'll have to get like fuckin all A's next semester too to bring back my GPA. Knowing my dumbass though, that's about impossible. Don't know how I'm going to tell my parents I got a D, I want them to be proud of me and to be able to talk about me with my our friends, who also have kids my age doing well in college. But nope, gonna have to admit I'm pretty fucking stupid apparently and that I got a D, or at the very best, a C-.

Edit: Checked ratemyprofessor again, apparently last year she had to curve the final do to people not passing. I can only hope that my class as a collective is as stupid as I am, and didn't do the homework just like me, and we all get curved into a C and I cry tears of happiness.

1569,helpandadvice1,1447055692,/r/college/comments/3s3yzv/doing_bad_in_school_and_dont_know_what_to_do/,"As title says, I have no idea what to do. I feel bad about my grades and tried my best for my classes, but no results. 

Here's my story. 

I was admitted as a computer engineering major(big mistake.... into a good university in 2011. I was excited to start a new chapter in life. First quarter goes alright. I was getting a feel for the classes, but got a 2.0 for the first quarter. I also hate to admit that I ditched classes and that's probably where I started declining. I skipped class to sleep in, play video games etc...I'm not a party person so that wasn't one of the reasons.

2nd quarter comes and I'm taking classes related to my major such as Calculus and Physics. I have never taken Calculus before and I thought Physics was going to be easy since I liked the subject in HS and did pretty well on it. I was wrong. Things started going left and right. I was doing bad in both of the two classes. I skipped some of my classes and failed the two classes. (C- on physics but I count it as failing because you can't advance with a C-). I ended the quarter with a horrible GPA. It dropped horrendously.

It also happened for the third quarter. I was taking a programming class. As usual, no programming experience. I was also skipping classes because it became a habit and as usual I did bad that quarter too. It was at that point where I was on academic probation. 

I took 2 summer classes (Calculus being one of them and also did bad on it. It was bad enough to pass though. I also did bad on my other class, but at least it was an okay grade...)

For my second year(2012), I was taking Calculus 2 and retaking Physics and also took some GEs. I failed those two classes. I don't know how I lost my motivation but I did. My parents told me to switch majors and I told them that I could handle and they trusted me. I let them down. 

I tried my best the next two quarters but I couldn't do anything. I did okay on some classes. I wanted to switch my major to Psychology and I took some classes for it, but it wasn't my thing. For the quarter before summer, I talked to my counselor about what I should do. Should I go to community college for a while and come back? She said that I should so I followed her advice.I signed a leave of absence. My parents weren't too happy about it. 

I went to community college classes and took some classes and did okay on them. I went there for 1.5 years. I was also talking to my counselor in my university and ask if I could be undeclared before I switch to computer science for a while and she said to talk to a counselor from there. I did and the counselor there was nice and giving me advice and told me not to take computer science as a major because I did bad on calculus. He recommended me to be an informatics major. I was supposed to come back as an extension student of January of this year, but he never email me back last year. I have no idea what happened to him. When I talked to a new counselor for undeclared, she wasn't very nice about it. She kept ignoring me. I called and asked to speak with a counselor and she kept insulting me, calling me a troubled child etc... She probably has tenure so I can't do anything about that. I even made an appointment and went up there and she never saw me. They said they will see me, but it never happened. They went on their lunch break...I didn't take classes for that quarter.

I was able to take extension classes for the next quarter though. I don't take the actual extension classes though. I go to the actual classes where regular students go and learn there. I came back and took 2 GEs and did pretty good! 

I took a class related to my major for summer. It was also a programming class. I also talked to a counselor in the middle of it and she said I would have to be an extension student for another 2 quarters. She gave me a list of classes to take. Great! I ended the summer class with a B+ which is nice considering my past. 

So this is a new school year. I'm taking 3 classes. (One statistics class, one CS class and one GE). I'm not too worried about the GE since I'm probably doing well in it. For statistics, I thought I was going to do well. I studied for the first midterm for a good week and was pretty confident about it. I got the results back and I did pretty bad.... The mean was about 76 and the standard deviation was 15. I was 2 below the SD.... I have a midterm coming up, and I studied for a few days and feeling good about it, but who knows.... For my CS class, there are 5 projects and for the first 2 projects you can work with a partner. Because I was enrolled late(out of my control, they basically accepted me during the 3rd week), I was unable to get a partner for the first 2 projects. I didn't know how to do it and the projects were really hard compared to the CS class I took during summer. I was unable to finish my first 2 projects, but I turned in what I could. We also had a midterm recently and we recently got the scores. Once again, I did bad. The whole class did pretty bad too. The mean was around a 65%, but I was way below that. I was also unable to finish my 3rd project but turned in what I could. The 3rd project was basically coding a GPS, and that is really bad. I'm not sure what to do anymore. I know I'm definitely going to focus on computer science after my upcoming midterm, but unsure of where to start. I've also tried using chegg for computer science, but I feel that they don't really help. I used chegg for statistics and that definitely helps compared to cs. Hopefully I will do well on statistics... Right now I'm not sure what to do if I fail 2/3 classes. I'm still not an official student yet until the next 2 quarters (assuming I do well that is). I stopped playing video games as much. I don't want to disappoint my parents anymore...

TLDR: Admitted to uni as a CSE major back in 2011. Did bad and failed my first 2 years because I skipped classes to sleep in,play video games etc. Requested a leave of absence and went to a community college for 1.5 years. Disappointed my parents. Came back this spring as an extension student and did well. Also did well for summer. Currently doing bad this quarter despite me studying for a week before the midterms. Don't know how to advance anymore. ",college,Doing bad in school and don't know what to do.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3s3yzv/doing_bad_in_school_and_dont_know_what_to_do/,1447073692.0

I had a diagnosis for ADHD way back in high school. My grades were too low for my intelligence, I would walk into rooms and forget why I was there, and I was generally a straight up space cadet. I took meds for a little bit, stopped due to side effects, then because my family had lowish income and 5 kids the matter pretty much dropped. 

I got into Dartmouth despite grades. On arriving I realized that I was actually going to take a lot of effort and focus if I wanted to do something notable. The lesson didn't take. I graduated with a 3.25 GPA and a B.A in Econ because it was their flagship program, even though I cringe at the idea of working for Goldman. Outside a few PE classes for fun my main extracurricular was League of Legends. 

Have graduated and spent almost half a year doing mediocre part time jobs (currently online calc/physics tutor) back at home. Doing apps made me want to die and I just couldn't blast out the hundreds it seems to take to get a job without good connections. Decided a couple weeks ago things had to change, talked to the doctor, got a different prescription. I feel amazing now, punch through work in hours that I would put off for days and cut my LoL addiction back massively.

A little before the prescription changed I took the GRE so I could improve my odds with a masters (looking at a comp sci masters because it aligns better with companies like Google I'm interested in). Got V169/Q170 (for some reason I can focus just fine in the testing room), which makes me feel like it would be a waste not to do grad school. I have some apps mostly finished already but would like to know if anyone has a recommendation for schools that would meet any of the following criteria:

1) Great Comp Sci program. I lucked out getting into Dartmouth and while I'm not dumb enough to think that makes me better than others, I don't want a master's from a ""nothing special"" school that might diminish the undergrad.

2) Would take a chance on someone who had something diminishing their academics before and wants to do round #2 better. Places that are more favorable to high scores and less to GPA. Or, places that are notably accommodating to ADHD students. Or some combo.

3) Places that actually still like ""bright and well rounded"" instead of ""ridiculously good at this one thing."" 

4) Places that are overloaded with rich people and might consider middling to low socioeconomic status a positive. I'm better off than a lot of people, but as the son of a single mom of 5 I had Dartmouth almost entirely covered by grants (and yes I do feel bad I didn't use that to the max, thanks).

However, I'm incredibly interested in the Earth and Space Science department UW has, as well as their Astrobiology graduate program. That is my dream career, and I am willing to sacrifice my time and money to achieve that dream. Now on to my concerns...
Do you think that a GED will matter after I get my Associates of Arts here at ASU when I try to transfer?
On the UW site it mentions that I have to have ~90 transferable credits to have priority as a transfer student. While I will have 90 credits by the time I'm done (I'm currently a freshman), I am more than certain that the ASU-specific ones will not transfer over (like orientation). Should I just explain that dilemma in the essay or stay more than two years to achieve the full 90?
I apologize for the ignorance, but  UW is my dream school, and I want to utilize all my resources to get answers to help me. Im doing the best I can here at the CC, and I will be applying to the Honors Program they have here this spring semester to look good on the transcript. It would also be nice to have some real answers, as my advisor thinks I should just stay in Arkansas and transfer to one of the bigger universitys we have here, even though that seems like a nightmare to me.

First time I've been in school in over 15 years (I was homeschooled most of my life). I've been through...a lot the last few years, but went in determined to do this. 

Then my husband was found to have a tumour in his head, 2 weeks before school started. His surgery to have it removed was last Thursday. He came home ""successful"" on Sunday, but now I'm sitting with him in ER from complications. I haven't been able to study for over a week. I had developed insomnia for a month prior. To add to it, several growths were found on my thyroid the same day his surgery was scheduled, so I have to go for a biopsy and likely surgery as soon as he's recovered. 

Before all of this, I immigrated to another country and got married. I learned to drive. I left an extremely abusive home where I had never had a real ""life."" My father died years prior, my previous boyfriend died the same year. I've just been through...a lot. My mom is mentally ill and will end up requiring me to support her because she won't go for treatment. 

I just feel beaten down. I don't know what to expect with either of our health right now. I already dropped one class so I could have more time, but now I can't even want to study. I just want to cuddle my husband and watch movies and to just...rest. :( But I'm already 27 and plan to go for a masters/PhD, so taking a break seems so unfair. My husband is waiting for me to finish so he can go back while I work. 

College was supposed to be fun for me. I love to learn, I teach myself for fun. But now I just feel like I can't care anymore. Years worth of school feels impossible. :/ I feel burnt out. 

I've tried going to the counsellor. She suggested what I already know/do and it didn't help. Counselling never did help me because I'm very self aware and never learn anything new with them. 

I feel like quitting, but don't want to be a quitter. ",college,"First semester, feeling burnt out and just want to give up. Too much has happened in my life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3rgqh5/first_semester_feeling_burnt_out_and_just_want_to/,1446638366.0
1574,IMessedUpALot2,1446503368,/r/college/comments/3r9sl2/i_graduated_from_the_university_of_phoenix_its/,"So, here is my story. I'm 26.

I'll tell you the life events that led up to UoP;

* Dropped out of high school at 16. Got my GED.

* Stayed at home from 16-18 doing nothing but running around and being a dumbass kid.

* Got arrested when I was 18 for illegal possession of marijuana and illegal possession of alcohol. Got my car impounded.

* Tried going to college at 19, failed out. Credit started going downhill from student debt.

* Got arrested again at 19. This time for battery. Drunken fighting.

* Tried to go to college again at 20, failed AGAIN. This brought my credit score down to a 425.

* Decided dispute the bad reviews, I would try UoP, and if it didn't work out for my, I would just off myself. I was 21.

Now while I attended UoP, I was teaching myself to program at the same time. I was dedicated to turning my life around. Little did I know that the UoP classes were compressed into 6 weeks for the whole course and there really isn't a summer vacation, you just move onto the next class in a week. I literally got my BS in like one and a half years. No joke. There was no teacher interaction. You got a reading, and questions about it. Every single night. That was it.

I ended up with a BS that costs me 30K. Yes, I have 30K in debt from ONE AND A HALF YEARS. Outrageous. 

Now here is my life *after* the degree;

* Got a job paying 40K as an entry level programmer in the Midwest at 23. This is all I needed, this is what set my career forward. The degree opened the door through HR, my skills got me the job.

* At 24 I sent out my resume to the Big 4. Left out the college degree, told them specifically my skill set and my personal projects, had a great reference from company i worked at before. Got rejected.

* At 25 i sent out my resume again. This time I got an interview. Got the job.

Now I make 115K a year as a programmer for one of the Big 4.

Yes, the degree is completely useless. Sometimes I look at it to laugh but in all reality, I wouldn't have made it this far without it. Don't attend this school. If you can get your **masters** degree in 20 months, it's probably not the best option. The only way I got my job is because I put I had a BS, I didn't specify the school until I got into the interview, and I made damn sure to PUSH my skills before I brought it up and even still, I literally got laughed out a good couple times.

And by the last couple months, they fucking NAIL you with homework that is completely outrageous. You're talking writing 3K word papers 4 times over the course of 6 weeks, programming FULL PROGRAMS without any prior learning, and having 4-5 multiple choice papers PER WEEK that were completely out of what we were learning.",college,I graduated from the University of Phoenix.

1576,callofdukie09,1446242378,/r/college/comments/3qw95n/considering_returning_to_school_at_24_a_few/,"Hi reddit, I'm 24 and am considering returning to school after about 4 years.  A quick bit of background, and I have a few questions. 

Recently I've been feeling a bit stuck in my current position due to lack of a college degree.  I currently work full time as a computer repair tech earning a mediocre wage, and while I don't necessarily want to 'move up' I want to feel more challenged and fulfilled by my day to day work, and would like a bit more financial freedom.  I would keep working full time throughout school.   


So I first attended school for about a year and a half.  My first semester I cleared a 3.4 GPA,  by second semester it began to tank a little bit, and I ended around a 2.6.  By the start of the next semester I had tried to change majors, foolishly without the advice of counselors in both colleges about what I should have considered before doing so.  A combination of laziness, depression, and just not really knowing what I wanted to do with my life ultimately led to my dropping out before the semester was even halfway over.  I believe I was past the point of leniency, so some of those classes were counted as my having failed.  As a result, I think my GPA may have taken a hit, though I honestly never really cared to look at the time.  So my most academic history isn't exactly stellar.  

The second real issue I've run into is that I also had fallen on some hardships after leaving school which put me about $6000 into credit debt.  I personally am NOT comfortable with the idea of incurring any more debt in order to attend school.  Which basically means if I'm returning it must be done on grants, scholarships, or out of my own pocket.  

Finally, I'm completely unsure of what I would even study.  This just worries me in the sense that I may get partially through and hit a dead not knowing how to continue.    

My thoughts are that I should start with community college and acquire an associates degree, trying for every scholarship I can get, and paying the rest as I go.  Hopefully I do well enough that my academic history will improve and open up more scholarship options to finish a bachelors.  But there are a few things that I'm not quite sure on and would like a little advice before I continue research.  Especially from those who may have dropped out and made the decision to return at a later time.

1.  My lack of a completely thought out plan as far as what I would study and how long it would take me to pay for and complete all my classes makes me wonder if it would actually be worth spending the time and money in the first place.  Should I try to solidify my plan, or just start taking the first steps?  Typically I'm a go with the flow kind of person, but I've acted brashly enough in the past that I've learned there are some things worth considering.    


2.  What is the likelihood that I would be able to fund my college experience in a timely manner (hopefully no more than 6 years for a bachelors) without the aid of student loans?  Anything I should consider when planning for this?    

3.  Are there alternative options to minimize my financial impact I may not be aware of?  I'll take anything from moving to a foreign country to work/volunteer programs, etc. 

4.  What resources are available to help me explore my interests, and assist in finding an area of study suited to me?  

5.  If anything, what else should I be considering?   

My apologies for the length of the post, and some likely grammatical errors.  Thanks in advance for any advice you may have for me!

I'm a junior at a university (BS in chemistry major) and my GPA is pathetic. Right now it's only about 2.3.

So my situation isn't bad, I guess. I'm 19 turning 20 this December, have about 26 credits finished up at a community college from my hometown. I've been taking all online classes because of you know - life. 

I have two jobs, and my girlfriend and I are moving closer to those two jobs next week, we have an apartment set up and everything. (She also works full-time but isn't going to school at the moment.) 

After this semester i'll be at about 35 credits finished. I was going full time but this semester has been tough. I've had a lot going on life, my grades had been suffering, I dropped classes - the works. I don't currently have any debt from those 35 credits i'll accumulate but I don't think I can keep doing online classes at my college. 

They aren't very good.. It's a small community college from my hometown, and i'm an Information Technology major.. which my area is very depressed of. My girlfriend and I are moving BECAUSE of how depressed our hometown is economically, and so that I might find some kind of entry level opportunity in I.T. (Currently working at the Geek Squad at a Best Buy - want to progress.)

The classes are not organized well. Half of my professors have large language barriers because the school doesn't really invest in the I.T. program, and they have to outsource the classes to someone that can basically just assign simulation work online. (I'm online anyways, but their assignment instructions/requirements are barely understandable sometimes). Along with me failing classes + dropping some, after this semester my academic progress won't be where it needs to be so i'll lose financial aid for the time being. 

But still, i'm 35 credits deep with no debt. I've been getting enough FAFSA aid to cover literally everything expense wise at this community college. (My parents are quite poor.)

From here, I don't particularly know where to go. I'm setting up an appointment with my advisor at this community college that I won't be attending next semester because of some life stuff I need to figure out. I don't feel like i'm learning valuable I.T. skills with this college. I have learned more in my 5 months working at the Geek Squad than I have with 35 credits (some gen. ed) at the college.

I want to transfer to a nice school - not sure if I want a 4 year university yet.. Might just try associates in CiS/I.T. and grab some certifications, see if I can land a low level tech job at a company and work my way up. Learn from there.

But I don't want debt.. I know it could be a lot worse. I could be 60k in debt at a prestigious college and decide I want to become a philosophy major my third year in, etc. (not a shot at philosophy majors).

My girlfriend and I are pretty flexible as to where we can move, but we obviously can only do it steps at a time. This move to the new area is for our jobs + to get out of the depression that is our old area. I mean it was bad, 0 opportunity. 

We plan on living in the new area for 1-2 years, saving up money, and planning from there. The new area is a lot nicer than our home town but it doesn't have any colleges for I.T. :( 

Right now we are moving to a place in PA 125ish miles from Cleveland, where I thought might have better opportunities for my education and career, as well as her.

I have even thought about moving to canada for citizenship, for both the education, healthcare, and politics. I don't particularly agree with much of what America is doing. Or how behind they are in certain social aspects. 

I want to better myself and further my education and career - this college is not doing that for me. Some of the people I work with at the geek squad that have other jobs don't even have degrees, or certifications they just have raw experience. 



**TL;DR** - 19 y/o comm. college student, has 35 credits, no debt, hates current college, moving from area, do not want to take online classes with current college, feels like not learning much, wants an area with better opportunities for information technology, open to relocating, canada..? **END TL;DR**



This is very long post, and it's geared towards anyone with possible advice, a tip, a recommendation, anyone in the I.T. field, ANYTHING really.

Where should we go city wise for I.T..?

Should I be scared of a break from college? So many people say that it's a terrible idea.

Is Canada that much cheaper for schooling?

Is it even possible to get an entry level job in I.T. without a basic associates? I feel as thought I would learn more from the experience at this point.

Do I take a year off from school right now, save as much as possible and then say screw it just take out loans for a 4 year university near me and transfer those 35 credits?

As of right now i'm open to all opinions - because i'm still developing a game plan. Of course only I can answer what I want to do, but if any of you are in tough situations, share those too.

Thanks.

I know I dissaponted my parents too. I have two older sisters and two other younger siblings. My oldest sister who is 24 went to community college but dropped out on second year. My other sister who recently turned 21 is the most successful one so far, she just transferred to UCSD as a junior  from community college. Both of them didnt know about the SAT or any of this shit either or at east they didnt do any of it.


I went on a college match today and plugged in my preferences, grades, majors etc.. I didnt get any matches that I hoped for and thats when I realized I fucked my life up. I was about to tear up until I realized its my own fault for this and I dont deserve any sympathy.

Although things are going well, I've realized I have a real desire to study neuroscience and consciousness, but I don't feel like I can commit to a full 3-4 year program (been looking at schools in Europe mostly that are 3 years) when I can't really be sure where I'll be over the next few years - I may need to move for my career. 

That said, I'm curious if there are any ways that any of you might know of in which I could complete a degree largely through self study on my own accelerated schedule. I found school moved too slowly and I can learn much faster on my own with just a few books. The pacing of school was one of the reasons I dropped out in the first place, as it just did not gel with how I learn. 

I really would like to get a degree, but I just find the usual way of going through school to be incredibly torturous and I don't want to go through that again - I became very depressed and eventually my grades dropped as I just completely stopped doing my coursework. My ideal program would be one in which I could do 15 hours a day of study over the course of a year and graduate within that time frame so that I could go on to more advanced study and continue with my other career plans (without going into much explanation I basically have a year during which I need to put things on hold, so I thought I'd use this time to get a degree). 

I am willing to move anywhere in the world and have been looking mainly at universities in Germany as it seems their system might fit the bill. I thought I'd ask here though in case anyone has any ideas. 

If anyone knows of any ways in which I can get a degree through examination, please let me know.

I dropped out of undergrad back in 2007. (It was originally a leave of absence; ultimately, I never returned to school.) I've got 4-5 completed semesters under my belt. I'm now 28 and lacking direction in life. 

A couple of questions:

(a) How likely is it that I'll be able to return to my original university? Is this dependent on my GPA and what I did during my time away from school? What other caveats typically apply?

(b) Will I have to retake the SATs? If it's not required, *can* I retake the SATs as a demonstration of my aptitude? 

(c) Is there a buzzword for a student like me? (Having trouble Googling this situation.) For instance, I may fall under the larger umbrella of 'transfer students'; what's the word for my particular *brand* of umbrella?

If you sign up(I assume for info?) they'll invite you to a party or two. This was an after party for a school-held concert, which was pretty great. You'd get it if you were there. 

Note: this is a **sober** experience. I didn't drink at this night. 

We went to a parking lot and got in a car. The guy wasn't expecting more than one person, but welcomed us all to come along. 

Once we got to the party they dropped us off so they could find parking. There were people outside leaning on cars, and they were pretty welcoming. 

We went inside and there was alcohol. **Everywhere.** The garage we passed through had two games of beer pong going. The kitchen counter was used as a serving bar in which cheap(ish) big bottles of vodka were being poured into tiny Dixie cups for shots. 

There were two coolers in the kitchen, each filled with coors lite or tecate. My friends went in the line and took a couple shots each. I avoided it and snagged a sealed water bottle from the case so I'd have something in my hand. 

There were also Pepsi cartons(36 pack? Idk), which some people had grabbed from. 

The wall decorations were all just class pictures of the fraternity. The walls were off white. 

The dance room, which was just a room with towels blocking the windows and a speaker and light-maker upstairs, had a wooden floor. 

After my friends got their shots, I talked to the head of our group and said that if they needed anything I would help them out and that I'd be dancing. 

There were lots of drunk people on the floor, but everyone was having a good time dancing. There was definitely grinding. I picked up some new moves(this is my 3rd time dancing) and met some new guys. My friends ended up drinking about 6 shots throughout the night each and playing pong with no liquid because they'd had enough. 

At the end of the night cops came. We had to shut off the music and be quiet until they left. Lots of people were nervous, but I was pretty calm because I was sober. 

After the cops came they started playing music again, but more quietly. The party was subsiding/being ended, and the frat guys started offering shuttles back home by sober members. We got a ride back to our dorms. 

This was just my general experience and I posted it here for people who may be curious. I go to a public school that is well known for partying and debauchery and is on the West Coast.

**Education:** The school I am going to offers an accelerated 3 year/6 semester degree option. They even have an elementary school on campus that you get to work with. You can even opt to teach at both pre-K and elementary levels. I'm interested in Education because I have wanted to become a teacher since before 2008. I have a lot of teachers who inspired me to take this road (mostly middle school and high school teachers). *But* my ideal grades to teach is 6th grade to 12th grade, not elementary schoolers. The school I am planning to attend Spring 2016 semester *only* has Elementary Education. 

**English/Creative Writing:** The school I want to go to, and am planning to attend, have professionals who visit the campus throughout the year for those in this program. They also hold an annual Scriptwriters Showcase. They have a couple of other programs for this too. Now my only problem is, I haven't been able to write any poetry or short stories or anything of that sorts since 3 or 4 years ago. Prior to my writers block, I was pumping out short stories every other day and poetry flowed through me like a coursing river. I take interest in this program because I want it to re-activate my creativity, re-awaken the writer in me. However the downside is that the job field is really sketchy unless you are extremely lucky (at least in my opinion... but that's why I need you guys). 

**Fashion Design &amp; Product Development**: The school is the 13th best fashion program in the world according to Business of Fashion London. It is also named No1 in Long Term Value and No5 for best learning experience. They have an annual runway show, and you get to take international trips for college credit. Now I take an interest in this program because I want to create a comfortable, affordable, yet stylish line of clothing for plus-size people. I am plus-size and have been throughout my life. The reason why I want to create comfortable, affordable, and stylish clothes is because for me in school clothes were extremely plain and dull. When I found an outfit that fit my fashion tastes, it was too small. And when I found a plus-size version of it (online) it was too expensive. 

The last two are kind of one in the same... **Psychology &amp; Human Development:** they are two different programs at the school, but they are overall the same. Except, Human Development works with the Education students at the Elementary School on campus. Since I was 7, I had an intense passion for the inner working of the mind. I was also the kid in the background just observing how people acted. This may be closer to Sociology, but I wanted to know why people acted the way they acted. I didn't care much for how they interacted with each other, not as much as I wanted to pick their brain for anything that could cause a certain behavior based off of past experience or etc. 

Sorry if this post is a bit disorganized and hard to understand, but basically I want to know...

* How rewarding is (one of the subjects above) to you?
* Do you enjoy (one of the above subjects), and what do you enjoy about it?
* Is the subject challenging enough for you?
* How long have you been interested in the subject?
* Based off the information I provided, which one do you think I'd enjoy the most? - you really don't have to answer this one, I just like opinions.  ",college,A bit indecisive...

I have a 3.9 GPA.  4 years sense I graduated high school.  I'm not sure what I want to major in yet, but at some point I'll decide on one because I want to have my BA before 27.

Sometimes I wish I would have waited and went to an university.  But at this point, I might be too far into community college to start over again.  I want to study abroad, and could do it for a low cost, but I'm having second thoughts because it seems like a lot of people my age and younger that are at a community college aren't the most normal people, so I might be studying abroad with a group of people who I don't like.

I recently won a scholarship at my community college, but I'm also almost at the point where community college is almost free because my ETC is 0 now that I don't have to use my parents tax info.

I've had some health issues and been in the hospital so I have dropped in and out of community college a couple times.
I’ve become socially isolated in the last few years and am estranged from a lot of my relationships that I was starting to make my first 2 years after high school.  A lot of the people I knew when I was 19 are starting to move on now.  I want to have more relationships and to have more fun.  I feel very lost.  I also don’t really know what I want to do, but I do have interests so I think I can eventually figure it out.  Money is important to me so I will probably choose something that pays well.

I’m trying to balance having fun and being successful in my life.  I am looking for some insight.

1591,SS_Architect,1440880236,/r/college/comments/3ivrkp/culinary_arts_long_read/,"As a young kid before even thinking about what high school was and the meaning of it, I had always wanted to be a chef. My father wasn't a chef, but he knew how to cook damn good food, be it on the grill, or his signature pancakes every Saturday morning.

It is said that people change every seven years, and I was in high school 7 years later. Deciding where I want to go in life, what I want to do or even be. The thought of owning my own restaurant has been stored in a tiny space in my thoughts and I really didn't make it a priority anymore. The thought just seemed hard when I was working fast food. I wanted to do what 2 of my other friends were going to do: Become a firefighter. So, I went to my counselor and he told me ""Today is the last day they are doing the tests for the year and it is located at X street and X city."" I had no way of getting there to take the tests to start the program. Maybe firefighting wasn't meant for me.

I had dropped out of high school and obtained my GED. The awesome part is, I scored in the top 10 percentile in the US. I was awarded my GED and off to my next thought of profession: Sports Medicine and Nutrition. Surely, that pays well, and I love sports and nutrition. I went to my community college and enrolled. But the health classes were so jam packed due to pricing, my health classes would start in 2 years. I couldn't wait that long, and I didn't want to fall victim to a technical institute. Sports medicine just wasn't the answer at this time. I was an enrolled student with my major of Nothing.

I am still working at my fast food job. Come home, play video games, until one day it clicked. I wanted to be a video game designer. I found this amazing technical school for a bachelors degree program in video game design. 24 hour access to the school, free books, free use of the computer, and Autodesk Maya was free too. I enrolled, and began taking classes. It was until 2 weeks into the courses where it didn't feel right. It was hard to get to school anyway. I lost motivation and dropped out.

I became a supervisor at my fast food job that I had been at for about a year now. I felt that I needed to make more than $7.50 an hour as a supervisor. I employed myself at a call center, hated it. Then worked at a warehouse. I loved it, but ate off of a food truck and had poisoning and was fired for missing work from being sick. I received a phone call from the new manager at my old fast food job offering me more money to come back. The new manager had been my friend for 6 months, and loved my skills. I went back and also became better friends with my manager, and fell in love with my other fellow supervisor. 3 months later, I was promoted to Assistant Manager.

My new girlfriend that I fell in love with had worked with me for a year after that. We then decided to move in together with my sister. That was a mistake, moving in with my sister anyway. We both left our fast food job and employed at a Chat center for Tech Support. Then moved in on our own. We were living life happily, and got too comfortable. We missed a lot of work and became irresponsible, so much in fact, we were fired. I then got a job with the Union: Plumbers, and pipefitters. They had a school program that paid me good money, but it was something that I did not want to do. I was going to work to make money, like the rest of the world. I was not happy. I enrolled in the school program and had worked in the trade. I then got injured, and was laid off. Right about at the time I found out that we were having a baby. I left the plumbers and pipefitters. 

I then got a job where I could. Retail. Very very bad. I couldn't handle it. I decided to invest my time into something that would make money in the future. I have a baby coming, and money was the only thing I was working for. Money money money. And I couldn't get enough of it. I started training for a Microsoft Certification and even enrolled into another technical college for Computer Programming and Networking. They would have me graduated ""In a year and a half"". I started the programming school and got 6 months into it before noticing I wasn't getting anywhere. 6 months, and I haven't even learned HTML. Not a single programming language. Demotivated and dropped out. However, I picked back up on my MCSE and continued on that. 

So far, I cycled through many jobs, and far more schools than I planned on in the first place. And not to mention along the way, my love of my life had only lived with me for a total of 1 year so far along the way. She lived with her parents when she wasn't with me. It was time to take a stand, and pull my head out of my ass. For me, for my girlfriend that I hope to make my wife one day, and my newly born baby. I was still enrolled at my community college for Nothing, and so I went back and started Networking school. She started MRI Tech school. We both could not do it online, we have no vehicle. We then together, dropped out. She moved back in with mom and dad... with our baby.

I had finished my MCSE training, but cannot afford to pay for the tests and certificate. Besides, I lost interest. I now work for a different tech support call center and pay child support, to the woman I still love who has a call center job better than mine. Who I know is thinking about leaving me any day now, because I cannot support them. With my track record? I don't blame her. 

It was just until Thursday, August 27th 2015 that I had decided to make another turn around in my life. I had found that my Community College that I am STILL enrolled into Nothing, has a kick ass Culinary Program. I called the academic adviser and asked about it. He said ""I can only say, go take a tour with the president of the program."" So I did. He explained that the program is rigorous. 12-14 hour lectures a week. On top of that: 1,000 hours of working in a restaurant who makes there food from scratch is required to graduate, also our program teaches you how to start and run your very own restaurant. And it teaches you how to garden, grow fresh produce and herbs. Over 20,000 square feet of kitchen to learn in. You will be educated on becoming a pastry chef and an executive cook. And it's all done in one building. They are in longstanding with ProStart, skillsUSA, and even give you a certificate from the American Culinary Federation (ACF). Restaurants always contact us for new hires, and jobs are guaranteed. 

As I was taking the tour of the campus, my heart sat up from all the beatings it took in the past. I knew this was my destiny. I needed this now! ""Classes begin in spring."" Totally shot down. But then, one of the chef instructors came out from his office and introduces himself. A man, for some reason had a light aurora around him. Which was weird, because I don't believe in that shit. And he begins to tell me ""I can get you in this week if you are willing to commit, I can also get you a job to obtain your one thousand hours that will be flexible for your education."" 

I left the building skipping and hopping which I did not know how to do. I called my girlfriend to break her the news. She wasn't as enthralled as I was, and I'm only going to leave it at that in case she is reading. I still love her and want to save what I have left with our relationship. I promised her we would marry. 

I am about to start school again, but this time for something that I really want to do. Something that I feel like I can invest my heart and spirit in. I hope this is the right choice.

1593,throwawayq_a,1440625339,/r/college/comments/3iip1c/feel_i_wasnt_given_a_proper_education_while_home/,"I was home schooled by creationists in Texas and feel received no formal high school education. I struggled and finally graduated college, I’m trying to get into grad school and can’t because of how bad my transcript is, and I feel I was not adequately prepared for the material. What can I do to improve my chances of furthering my education?

My father worked full time and my mom was stayed home to, I guess, teach. My home school experience was like this: from elementary- middle school, school was from 8:30-12 noon (usually), M-F. We would start out with about an hour of prayer and bible study/Max Lucado; about 30 minutes of mom reading from a history textbook; then a little math basic math; maybe some creative writing actives that were not checked for spelling, grammar, nor punctuation; then about 30 minutes of reading a Little House on the Prairie type series of books about the US history that, while based on US events, were still fictional. Occasionally we’d have our prayer and bible reading, before hitting the dollar movie theater for a non-educational movie, maybe 1/5 the times, when we wouldn’t have actual school, we would go see a play at a theater or go to an actual museum. Notice I never mentioned any science or homework. My geometry in middle school consisted of “circle the acute triangle”. My economics was saving my allowance and money from jobs. By high school, we started around 9, were done around 11. I didn’t read anything. I didn’t learn anything. I thought I was really smart and just knew it all because there was nothing else being taught to me. Why else wasn’t mom giving me something to do? I think my baking and cooking counted as chemistry. No math, still no science. My English/vocab credit throughout all of this was sending emails to my friends (with a middle school level vocabulary that was never checked nor corrected). I graduated high school not knowing the difference between their, there, and they’re; you’re and your; not knowing how to use a comma, colon, or semi-colon. I had never heard of mitochondria, didn’t know what the numbers of the periodic table meant, didn’t know gravity was a force or what a force was, I had never ever heard of RNA, I didn’t know about the quadratic formula either. That is how little knowledge I had going into college. You don’t realize how often a professor will say “now, you probably learned this in high school…” I didn’t. I didn’t learn any of it because the resources just weren’t available. We we’re poor, we lived comfortably. My mom has her masters in early childhood education, so she knows how to teach CHILDREN, not middle school or high school. 

My parents had no goals for my education. The point of them home schooling me was to keep me from learning about sex, drugs, and evolution… in Texas. We had no tests. No exams. No quizzes. Nothing that would have maybe lead me to think that maybe I wasn’t on a high school level. I always thought I was on par with my peers from home school activities and sports, because I didn’t have to do anything. I had done it all. I thought I just got it all done super-fast since I didn’t have to walk between classes. My first flag that something was wrong, that I didn’t know what I was supposed to, was when I took the THEA (TX Higher Education Assessment?) to get into college. I failed the first time (didn’t make the bare minimum for any school), and had to take it 3-4 more times just to pass the 3 parts. I finally made grades that qualified me for remedial math and English. How could I have known something was wrong before that? How can I ask what is going on in Tokyo if I’ve never heard of Japan? 

I spent 3 years, full time (fall, spring, and summer) in junior college, before moving to university for another 3 years, full time (fall, spring, and summer). I had to drop and retake all my math classes at least once. Made C’s in my remedial and college level English classes. Couldn’t pass college chemistry and finished my degree with a lower level chemistry course. Dropped and retook many other science courses. Now my transcript is a complete wreck and no university or program will touch me because they rightfully don’t want to take the risk of giving away a spot to someone who might drop out. I worked very hard to earn my 3.4 GPA overall, but it took a few tries in some classes to get a passing grade. I’ve had to drop and retake so many that I went over the 40 hour rule, which says you have to complete a degree with an excess of no more than 40 hours of what it takes to earn that degree. So, if your degree requires 60 course hours to complete, you have to complete it in less than 100 attempted hours. I went over and had to pay extra my last semester. That’s how many drops I’ve had.

I feel like I did everything right while in college: I surrounded myself with super smart friends; I didn’t go out and party; didn’t drink until 21 and even then hardly ever; I studies much harder than my friends, and most of my class mates; I read the text books; I took the class notes; I only missed 4 class days during my entire 6 years, of which 2 were for funerals, one was because I was getting an award for a paper I wrote in another class, and one was because I just wasn’t feeling well. I did everything I could, and it wasn’t enough. 

I’ve tried to get into other bachelor programs, but I only meet the 3.0 minimum for prerequisites. I tried to take a practice GRE online and broke down before I finished the first section because I just couldn’t understand the questions being asked because I just don’t have a good foundation on which my education was supposed to have been built. 

What can I do? I can’t blame mommy for my shit transcript on school applications. I can’t think of how I can spin this to a positive that I’ve come a long way since basically not knowing how to read. I can show on a graph that, despite courses getting harder, my GPA slowly went up semester by semester. I’m 26, still no career, can’t get back into school to get that career. I’m stuck. What can I do? How can I fix this? Is it possible to fix this? Is there a form I can fill out if I feel I literally learned nothing in my home school education? I don’t know what to do and could really use some help here because I am so tired of being a failure. I have a passion for science and enjoy school and learning, but I just can’t get back in. I need to not only get into another program, but I need to complete it so that I know I’m not a failure. I feel that I’ve been cheated out of life and knowledge about the world and universe and that’s what bugs me. There was all this information available and they never told me.

Sorry if my formatting/organization is terrible; it's late and I've never done something like this before.

TLDR: low GPA, no friends, wrong major, depression, what's next?
Long-time lurker, made an account because I need some advice.

I'm a 20yo student at University of Houston, majoring in Biology. My parents pushed me to become a doctor from a young age (they insist they haven't) and I've been on the pre-med track for the past two years. Problem is... I hate it and I think I've always hated it- I was delusional and wanted to conform to something, especially since it was brought up a lot at home.

Let's start with high school- I loved high school. Had some great friends, some great memories, and some great regrets, but hey that's what high school is right? I managed to grab 28 hours of college credits (sciences and english), so I had that going for me. Problem is... I didn't do too well otherwise, and didn't get into most of the schools I wanted (and my friends went to). Now I go to UH. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent school but I just don't have much pride in going there...

The original plan was to graduate with a BS in Biology in 3 years and go into medical school.

First semester was going well, had a really high GPA, applied to transfer to the school most of my friends were going to, but I found out that I would lose those 28 high school credits, so I decided to stick around.

This is when the problems start.

Spring of freshman year, I made the ridiculous decision of taking 19 hours- including FOUR ""Junior/Senior"" level courses. Wasn't really interested in my classes and my GPA dropped but it was still manageable. I was thinking that was the lowest of my lows...

Summer after Freshman year- I decided to take Organic Chemistry 1 and 2 over the summer (yeah, not the brightest decision). I understand if I actually enjoyed the material and was motivated to learn it, it's not all that bad, but I didn't. I got a D in 1, and had to drop out of 2.

Fall of sophomore year- still taking Biology major courses, mostly higher levels. I'm really not seeing anything wrong with my life at this point for some reason :( I fail one class, get a C in another etc.
To top it all off, my mom gets diagnosed with Breast Cancer. My dad took time off work to take care of her through treatment. Although I didn't have to do much more around the house, I think her diagnosis and seeing her in that condition had an impact on my mental health.

Spring of Sophomore year- Decided to try my luck in a biotechnology degree plan, and took two Btech courses along with the regular Bio's. I tanked yet again- failed a class, got a D in one.

My GPA got the worst of it; it's about a 2.3 right now.

I don't really have any friends. All of my close high school friends went to other schools- Everybody I know is more of an acquaintance.

I hate pre-med and biology in general.

I feel depressed whenever I don't have any social interaction.

I've never had a relationship.

Financially, I don't have any scholarships- my parents funded me a little bit, and the rest (~20k) is on federal loans.

I'm having a bit of a crisis right now. I know I screwed up. It started with choosing this Bio major and not switching out even when I realized it wasn't gonna work out. I was being delusional and living life on a day-to-day basis. Not having any real friends didn't exactly help- I spent a lot of time alone with my thoughts.

What I've always had a liking for was engineering- specifically mechanical and aerospace. I absolutely love machinery and cars and airplanes. I've honestly spent hours on youtube watching videos of how things are made and how an airplane works etc etc.

Problem is, I talked to the engineering department and they require an absolute minimum 3.0 GPA. After the hole I've put myself into, I don't see that working out.

My best friend's mom suggests I take a semester off from college and work full-time.

I was thinking about taking 12 hours of ""core"" courses and doing a part time job (I don't have any work experience, where should I go to find a job?).

The question remains: Should I suck it up and finish the last 30 hours of my degree and graduate with a BS in Biology and see what 

I can do from there? Masters? Try to find a job with that BS degree? (lol)

Or do I try to change majors into something more manageable?

Or do I completely drop out of college, get a job, and move on with life?

People who see me on a regular basis probably don't think anything is wrong with me; I smile a lot, laugh a lot, get along with everyone, and when I'm not depressed, I'm actually a great person to be around.

On a positive note, my mom has been responding well to treatment and prognosis looks good :)

ANY ADVICE IS SERIOUSLY APPRECIATED, THANK YOU!

1595,NLoki,1440142967,/r/college/comments/3htnm2/spent_the_last_5_years_trying_to_start_college/,"Hello Reddit!, For the last 5 years I have been trying to start college since I got out of High School (2010), admittedly my grades were frankly awful. I admitted myself to a Community College, well several actually. In Fall 2010 I admitted myself to a local community college looking to transfer to a University (either a UC/CSU), however in middle of the semester my family was suddenly evicted from our house, my mother lost her job and we were losing money fast, regrettably I dropped out of college to find a job and try to stabilize the situation. 

Then in 2011, I later proceeded to move out of State to another institute looking to start college there, it was actually quite okay at first, but at that point I had become pretty disillusioned of college, I actually lost interest in it and I thought this was going no where, so I dropped out (REGRETTABLY AGAIN) and I worked for a few years 2012-2014, and By late 2014, I decided to move back to my original State of Residence (better living conditions) and try to start college again here.

When I got here I ALREADY missed Spring 2015 at the College I was going to attend so I spent the Spring/Summer looking for a job and a place to stay. Well the transition back to California was rough, I still have not found a job, and frankly I've been couchsurfing through my friends and family while my Mom stays with her friends. I got so caught up with it I FORGOT to Take assessment and register for fall 2015 Classes. AT this point most (desired) classes are full and I'm going to the counselor to see what I can do, I've wasted 5 years so far and Most of my peers are already graduated and in the career they desire. the worst part of it all, when I took the Assesment, I placed EVEN LOWER than before meaning I would need to take many Preqs.

TL;DR: I graduated High School at 18, and Restarting college at 23, unsure how long it's going to take to even graduate. Is this normal? And is there any advice you can give me, since I feel awfully terrible and I really wish I stuck to my plan 5 years ago.

And Yes, dropped out = no valid Transcripts.

I would appreciate any advice and knowledge bombs you can offer.

After about a year there I went through some difficult personal issues and I just wasn't the same person. I became depressed, felt like I didn't know anyone at my school and neglected much of my work. That, combined with being someone who changed their major several times, I essentially spun my wheels for the next ~ 2 years barely getting by. D's C's, the occasional A and quite a few F's. 

An embarrassing amount of these F's came from courses directly related to my major, meaning I had to retake several courses that I couldn't progress to the next level up without. Several of them I did retake thinking I could do better, but I did not, and I failed them again. The class sizes of these were not large and I felt ashamed of myself thinking of what my professors thought of me, the class sizes were small and I I developed a massive amount of shame for the kind of student I was.

Eventually I destroyed my GPA as you'd imagine, was academically suspended and dropped out of the University. 

Now, almost two years later, I am enrolled in classes at my community college and hopefully I will be readmitted to my 4-year University in the Spring as long as I get good grades this semester and impress the board.

The atmosphere is just kind of intimidating and seems cut into clear social groups that all center around Greek life. Not being in Greek or an Athlete I guess I just generally felt like a loser while I was there. I didn't know how to make any friends and just felt like I wasn't cool enough to be apart of anything with anyone or was just too shy to branch out. I issolated myself for this reason so when I was confused in my courses I had no one in my classes/social circle to lean on and just sunk. 

I'm worried about all of this but at the same time I have recovered from my depression and my heart has been re-ignited with love for education and I realize I want to finish what I started (and possibly even go on to get a graduates). Other schools are not really an option because of how specific transferring credits are; by going somewhere else I'll essentially have to retake courses I already have at this school in order to get the same degree, and it will be much easier to get re-applied for enrollment here than it would be to try to get accepted somewhere else with my shaky academic record. 

The major is Geology by the way, though I'm thinking of changing it to Geography or Environmental Science. I kind of wrote this in one running thought so hopefully it's formatted well enough to get what I'm saying. I guess I'm just looking to see if anyone else has a comeback story with college? How did you get past difficulties you may have faced and finished your education?

**Edit**: I might as well say, the personal issue I suffered was a break up. I had been going out with the girl for the previous 3 1/2 years, so during my freshman year of College I neglected making friends because I had her, but when it was over I had nothing, and the break-up itself really sent me into a dark place. Shortly after my grandfather died. These things just made it easy for me to allow my academics to slip since I felt so lost as a person.

So I dropped out of high school to get my GED at 17 and proceeded to work my ass off and employed unconventional methods to learn and teach myself to grow up. 

I was afraid of not progressing so much that I began to fall off with my friends and partner at the time. I felt anxious if I was not working, researching colleges, reading or immersing myself in a mooc. I didn't have a car when I first started going to college... so, I was taking online classes and walking to work, feeling isolated still. 
I have a car now and go to school, but no close friends. 

I feel like I am missing out on my youth because i commute to a college without groups and am not used to relaxing or socializing a lot. I am confident that life doesn't begin after college, I love people and feel as if a degree is not my only measure of fulfillment, I'm just still a little lonely. 

I know it's silly, but, how can I meet more people and relax?

Backstory: I was 21 at the time and suffering from an (at the time) undiagnosed case of adult ADHD. My doctor thought it was an anxiety disorder causing ADHD-like symptoms, and I was prescribed generic Zoloft to treat it. 

However, it only made me feel worse and I decided to leave school. I was already doing really poorly and felt like I would never graduate. For two years I worked various odd jobs, mostly food service/waitressing jobs but I did work a few cool ones (farm laborer on organic farm, helped run the local farmers market, decorated cakes in a bakery). And I although I met loads of interesting people and learned a variety of skill sets, I still wanted to go back and get my degree.

In winter 2014, I decided that I would prepare to go back to school. If I went back to my original college, I would have to take a two semester course for people that had slipped up and were on academic probation. Instead, I enrolled in a local community college, where I could get my sea legs back and then re-apply to my old university with a better GPA.

I was apprehensive to start all over again. I'm 23 now, turning 24 this year, and felt like I would be a grandma among all of the fresh-faced 18 year olds I was sure to have class with. I was also facing doubt from my friends, who looked down on community college and told me it was a ""waste of time"".

I'm happy to say that I started class today and oh man, I *really* missed school. A lot of the people in my class looked my age or older and my morale is high. I'm on low dose of ADHD medicine and feel great. I don't regret starting from the bottom and building myself back up one bit. 

My advice is, if you're thinking of going back, but are scared for whatever reason, **just do it!** Seriously, no one will judge you and you'll feel 100% more certain once you start.

Went to local in town community college, took all online courses, got a 3.8 GPA for the year. Dropped out of some along the way, Went to another CC in state, took 2 classes Spring of 14 there, got an A, and B. Decided to transfer there Fall of 14 for that year. Dropped some classes along the way, got put on academic probation/FA probation. Spring was off to a good start, however Dad passed in April, which through me for a loop, getting me suspended at the other CC. I talked back to my local CC who said it doesn't matter if I was suspended there or not, I can attend classes at the local CC, so I am. I have 8 classes left to get my associates and I plan to do that so I can go to ECU Fall of 16. How bad will the suspension hurt my chances? I won't have any time off, since I went immediately to start at this college in a few weeks, so are my chances good to get in? 

I should add I applied, as was accepted to attend this fall, but this was before all this went down.

Has anyone been in a situation like this? Are there any more resources for people like me? Is this plan a viable option?

Oh, and to make things worse, I scored perfect on reading and writing but it turns out I have had a learning disability called ""dyscalculia"" which makes math incredibly difficult. It also makes it extremely hard to read analog clocks, tell my left from right without looking at my hands, and perform choreographed dance. :| serious. I just found out after the Math portion of my exam came back with a 28/100, and googled :WHY AM I SO BA AT MATH?!?!?! Yeah I have had this the whole time. It explains why, in the math classes I DID pass I had such a hard time and had to take them at least twice. I REALLY need my old math credits to count, I worked so hard to pass those classes, and it doesn't matter anyway because anything I learn in math falls out of my ears like chlorinated water at the public pool. I am not going for a degree in anything that the profession will require any more math than what I already have been doing as a cashier the last 10 years. Again any suggestions, anecdotes, or knowledge that you can provide will really help out a poor working mother with a disabled husband (yeah I'm playing that card, so sue me! life is hard!)

I know that a lot of my school's scholarships cite participation in college activities or community service as a requirement, and I feel that's the part I'm mostly lacking in.

Problem is, there aren't any clubs that directly relate to my major here. The media production club (members worked together to film their own show) was available last semester, but I quickly dropped out of it because I could not participate in the actual filming/recording activities (class conflicts during filming times), and I'm fairly sure that it's being dissolved anyway (most of its other members were graduating). The closest-related club is the art club, and I'm not sure if that's more serious or casual. 

For the sake of scholarships, etc. I'm not sure if it looks better to participate in certain types of clubs over others. Is it? Is it not? Would participating wholeheartedly in a more ""fun"" club look better than being a not-so-dedicated member of a more career-beneficial one?

It's reflecting on my transcript, too. This would technically be my 4th semester (not including summers-- started in spring '14) and I feel like I've already screwed up my transcript.

Here it is:

I tried to take Summer courses to ""balance"" out the W's on my transcript, but they ended up being too much for me to handle. Luckily I dropped them before the ""drop by"" date. By the way, W's stand for ""Withheld"".
I don't know if other schools have better policies, but my school's ""drop by"" date is literally a week and a half after courses start.


Anyway, I signed up for 4 courses for the Fall semester, and I'm feeling overwhelmed. Its almost been a full year since I've been in a school setting, and I feel like I can't ""get in the groove"" of things before classes start.

How can I get myself to relax? To prepare for this semester? Any suggestions at all? (Also, is my transcript as fucked as i think it is?)

Honestly, even though I've been taking courses for a year now, I still have no idea what I'm doing, what major I'm going for, what courses I should be taking, and what college I want to transfer to.

1616,Kate925,1436915792,/r/college/comments/3dbci6/degree_in_computer_science_vs_degree_in/,"[Warning, wall of text. TL;DR at the end.] I am a recent high school graduate, and I am going to be starting classes at a local community college in the fall. I want to decide my degree as early as I possibly can, and I feel as though I should have already done it sooner. I’m open to changing my mind in the future. I just need an idea for now so that I know what classes I need to be taking, and what to focus on. I’m split between mechanical engineering and computer science, and would like some advice on deciding.
When I was in middle school I had a “computers” class (That was the title. It was a tiny school, my class only had 16 kids, and we all took the same courses so there wasn’t much need to be specific). One of the programs that we were taught in this class was a program called Game Maker, and I really enjoyed it. Game Maker was very logic based, I spent a lot of time on it, and I spent many of my class periods dreaming up games to make based on what I knew that I could do logically speaking. That’s one of the reasons that I think I’d be good at computer Science, and in fact would really enjoy getting a degree in it. I worked on Game Maker in class, and any other time that I could, including many hours after school. Unfortunately one of the programs that we were taught shortly thereafter was Scratch, I’m kicking myself now for not paying attention to these lessons as only now do I realize what it was. I didn’t soak up a word of Scratch, I was too infatuated with Game Maker, in fact, I didn’t really pay attention to too many lessons after that, but I passed the class with over 100 percent, because for every game that I and another student (who also got addicted to Game Maker) created, we got extra credit. Unfortunately after middle school, I dropped this addiction, I saved all of my old games to my flashdrive at the time (which I still have), and downloaded Game Maker to my personal computer, but I never did anything after that. I didn’t lose interest in it, and I even dreamt up a couple of new games, but I never had the motivation to implement them. I always intended to go back to it. Game Maker is honestly the main reason that I think that I’d be interested in computer science, I mean I suppose some sort of degree in game development would be the logical next step if this were the case, but it wasn’t really creating games that I was interested it, it was more the sort of Logical Cleverness, I felt awesome when I could figure out a way to do something new that wasn’t explicitly taught, but I just figured out was possible based upon the puzzle pieces we were given. This is why I think that I’d be more interested in computer science. The biggest drawback is that this is the only evidence that I have that makes me think I’d be good at computer science, I don’t know how to code in the slightest, and in fact I suck at computers today. I am like years behind the rest of the world, I used Windows XP up until about a year ago, I am still in awe of the fact that Siri can actually accurately tell what you’re saying, the latest gaming device I have is a wii, the only social media I have is a Tumblr and a Facebook account that I barely ever use, and I prefer Final Cut Pro 7 over Final cut Pro X (I took two years of video journalism, and two years of film in high school.) That last one isn’t the best example, but I’m just trying to demonstrate that I haven’t really caught up to the world technologically speaking, I am way behind. This makes me hesitant to pursue computer science.
For mechanical engineering I don’t really have a personal story, I’m just interested in engineering as a whole. The idea of being able to dream something up, and to then see it come to life fascinates me, I want to be able to do that. I spent a while looking into each of the engineering fields, and mechanical engineering stood out the most to me. After that, I learned about some of the employers, and there are a lot of very interesting jobs in mechanical engineering. For instance, SpaceX hires a lot of mechanical engineers, not that I’d be going into space, but to work around that would be a very exciting experience. That’s what I originally decided that I’m most interested in doing, but before I locked that down as a degree, I wanted to look into other options and possibilities, and that’s what lead me to computer science. To be honest, I am very split between these two, they are both very stable well-paying jobs, and I’m interested in both.
I know that ultimately I am the only one who can decide which one I am more interested in, I’ll continue doing research into both after I post this, but I’m just looking for advice, which would you recommend? What are the pros and cons of each, are there any similar degrees to the one up above that you’d advise that I look into, or maybe even totally different degrees, I don’t know. Advice, opinions, anything, what are your thoughts?

**Thank you!**

*I just received word that I am ineligible for financial aid due to having dropped out five years ago. I had attempted a medical withdrawal, which was not possible due to my lack of documentation at the time. Since then, I have seen many different doctors and have what I imagine is a confusing medical record. To the best of my ability, let me explain my situation at the time.*

*I had a strong start in college. As things became more difficult, I began seeing doctors and therapists who diagnosed me with depression, ADHD, and anxiety. Once the symptoms began to escalate, my condition was variously diagnosed as PTSD, bipolar disorder, ""schizophreniform disorder"" (temporary symptoms of schizophrenia), an  ""dissociative disorder not otherwise specified"" (sometimes considered a mild and more common form of dissociative identity disorder). To this day, there is no FDA-approved drug to treat dissociative disorders. All treatment is experimental, and most of it is through psychotherapy.*

*The most challenging symptom was a kind of temporary amnesia. I would sort of ""wake up"" at various points, sometimes not remembering most of the last week or even month. This was not due to intoxication or drug abuse. During these times, there would be evidence that I had made lifestyle changes and new friends, written notes to myself I did not remember writing, and sometimes even changed my major. My short-term memory remained unaffected, but I was unable to manage coursework, as I was losing crucial chunks of time and felt I had no control over my behavior. The stress and confusion had also caused me to completely lose interest in my education and future, and even attempt suicide once.*

*Part of the difficulty in claiming a medical withdrawal was finding or affording a psychiatrist, and over the next five years, every doctor I saw gave me new and increasingly bizarre diagnoses, based on my wildly varying symptoms and that doctor's individual perspective. Psychiatrists would shut me up with new drugs that didn't work and labels that didn't explain my symptoms. Therapists and counselors would simply listen with no real insight or knowledge to contribute.*

*In the five years I've been out of school, I've gradually become stabilized. It's not the kind of condition that can be ""cured,"" but the symptoms are less of a threat to my future and more of an annoyance. A relapse or severe mental health crisis is extremely unlikely, and I have more knowledge and resources to deal with these things than I did five years ago. What I was experiencing seemed to be more of a buildup of neglected mental health issues over a long period of time that led to a prolonged nervous breakdown, rather than a degenerative condition that is likely to progress.*",college,Rough draft for an SAP appeal.

I've been struggling to do my work recently and it was brought up by a friend that I may have ADHD. This struck a cord with me as this was something that my mother and my grandmother argued about when I was younger. My grandmother claiming that as a teacher she knew the symptoms of ADHD and I had it, and my mom claimed that I could focus when I wanted to, and that I definitely did not have it. They each got some of my grade school teachers to agree with either of them, but then they eventually dropped the subject and moved onto something else to fight over, and I was never tested. 

To be honest, I don't believe that I have ADHD, I went over to /r/ADHD, and somewhere they had a link to some of the questions that a doctor may ask you, and came to the conclusion that while I display some of the symptoms, I don't display enough of them. Never the less, it's never good to self diagnose, and I still have the suspicion, so if I can I would like to get myself checked out.

Originally, I was in community college and had an overall GPA of 2.5 of so, before transferring to a SUNY school. My first semester at the new college, I was outed to my parents and was forced to move out, as they were very homophobic at the time (please, no opinions on my parents either, aside from their views on gays, they are incredible people). I thought I could handle everything, but my situation lead me to screw up the first semester there, and the second semester I basically dropped out. I took a semester off and, after a year and a half, I moved back into my parents house. We worked out our differences, mostly, although my GPA at the new college was awful (1.7?).
I went back to the community college, I received a 2.9 the first semester back and a 3.0 the next. I petitioned to return to the SUNY school, and they accepted me under the condition that I keep my GPA over a 2.0 and that I don't fail any classes. I received high marks in 3 of the 4 classes that I took, but I failed the 4th class (was actually the easiest of the classes, level 2 class, the others were levels 3 and 4). I got dismissed, and now I'm not really sure where to go from here. My adviser that I usually go to has been out for the past few weeks, and the adviser I spoke to yesterday told me to just choose a different degree. I don't need to hear that my grades are bad and therefore I shouldn't be an engineer; I know what I want out of life, career-wise, I know what my interests are and I know that I can be very successful. I'm just a little lost and unsure of how to go about finishing this degree.

Growing up, I was pretty good at math. Up through middle school, really. I wasn't top of the class, but I was fast at it and very accurate. Once or twice I was pushed down due to my quickness at quizzes and tests (I would finish first, and my teacher would force me to do the quiz again). Always had A's and B's. However, my family made a huge move from Arizona to Texas in the middle of the ninth grade during very important math, and I began having difficulties with it afterwards. I guess I felt like I just never caught up, and my trigonometry teacher in college actually helped me with doing FOIL (yeah, it was that bad at one point). I remember actually crying because, when taking practice state tests, I was right on the border for possibly not doing well in math, so I was put into remedial math courses to help me practice (like I'd go to a room with other kids and learn more about the basics of math). I was never at risk for failing high school math, but I'd float around at a C, maybe a low B. However, most people I know are aware that I am inherently better at biology or English, so that's why they always expect me to study. I have flipped around with a biology, English, and business major for years now (I am 23). I've been out of school for about a year and a half and have been working full-time as a result. I work now for a university which gives me a lot of downtime during slow seasons, so I'm allowed on the Internet to Facebook, Reddit, etc. Today, I decided I was going to teach myself something. I was playing around with a website that helps you learn the programming language Python (inspired by my boyfriend, who is a software developer), and when the website started having issues, I decided to take a break and think of something that might help. Then I remembered...hmm, maybe I could brush up on my math! So I signed up for Khan's Academy and started on some high school math.

So here I am, at work, doing math problems at my desk. My job does involve math as it is (part of the finance department; but we do mostly basic math, but yeah, like bank work), but no one is exactly doing complex problems over here. Thing is, even though I wasn't doing anything particularly impressive, I felt really good about myself while I did it. For years, I've always been like, ""Nah, I suck at math."" I dropped out of calculus twice because I would not practice my work and would panic and drop to avoid a bad grade. Now I'm realizing...well, if I could strengthen my background on the subject, maybe I could really look into a math-related major. 

However, I think I've basically psyched myself out. I know I shouldn't worry about what anyone else thinks about my degree, but I know if anyone asks and I say something math-related, they'll look at me like, ""Really, college-cashier? You, and math? Good luck."" I know high school math is practically a joke, but for some reason, I actually want to just keep doing the courses for math alone. I'm going back to school this fall and will be taking two classes a semester. Due to my job, I have plenty of time to work on my homework and study, so I'm not worried about not getting enough practice in.

So math-gifted people, did you start out with a natural knack to your subject, or did you really struggle with it, even in high school? My boyfriend has always been very talented with math and computers, so it comes as almost second-nature to him. I know no one flies out of the womb doing calculus, but...

Before I get to my story, some might say I am ok or why not talk to my family or friends, its just that my family never wants to talk: I have three older brothers. The one right above me in age dropped out in high school and does nothing but make fun of me most of the times.

This is my story: 
I was born in the U.S. Up to the age of 10 (fourth grade) I was not good in school (C's mostly). I then moved to my country (Palestine). Here, I learned a new language and went to a school that was pure arabic language. I did not know how to write or read so it was challenging, but I worked harder than ever. 5th grade, my average was 78 (no such thing as gpa there). 6th grade, average was 85, 7th grade, my average was 93 and I was third in my class. 8th, 9th, and 10th grade, my average was 96 and I was first in my class at the time. I couldn't have been happier. 

I moved back to the U.S and attended high School for 11th and 12th grade tackling some AP courses and attaining a 4.0 gpa both years. I applied to a University and got in.

Its the first semester in college, obviously I was too nervous. I am a student majoring in chemistry to pursue a career in dentistry (Always loved chemistry deeply with my heart). The first semester was challenging indeed but rewarding. I was able to get a gpa of 3.91 (I was taking 4 courses and one lab. I received A's in all of my classes and only a single A- in my English course. The courses were Calculus 1, General chemistry 1 and lab, English 1, and a general education course). I couldnt have been any more happier in my life. One of the most memorable accomplishments of mine during this semester was with my first exam in college: it was a chemistry exam. Out of my lecture of 350 students, my professor pointed out that one student received a perfect score, and that student was me. That day gave me the confidence I needed to move on and press forward. I have never been happier, really I enjoyed my winter break with to my heart's content because I deserved it.

Then my second semester started, Something about this semester was just totally off. I felt like I was going to do bad somehow. The courses I took this semester were the following: Calculus 2, General Chemistry 2, English 2, Biology 1, Bio lab and chem lab. My biggest concern was biology. I simply suck at biology and the rumors about biology one at my university were brutal (30% pass rate, horrible department, bad professors, disorganized, weed out course). I didnt believe any of them but they were all true. To begin with, my first chemistry exam the second semester got me a 89/100. This put me down way too much because I expected more of what happened the first semester honestly. But this worry became nothing when i started biology. The course was horrible and disgusting in every way, especially the lab. It was the worst experience ever. No matter how much I tried in that course, I could never get things right. My first exam was a 66 (this was the first exam I ever failed.) My second exam was a 79 and final was 71. I couldnt get myself to do well in this course no matter how much I tried. I spoke with the professor a lot for advice but to no avail. I am a mathy person; chemistry and calculus were natural to me but biology was just hell. What made it worse is that all my friends were doing well and I was the only one behind. Furthermore, I always hated the fact how I could help others with things like math because math is a process, but I didnt know how to get help in biology. I was the only chemistry major in my entire biology lecture and it was just devastating to see my end result. 

In the end of this semester, I got a B- in biology and an A- in English 2. I have to admit, my grades came out midnight and I was literally heartbroken. My gpa was 3.58 for the semester ((was knocked off of deans list). I was the friend who was the ""smart"" one everyone believed in and everyone always told me not to worry because Im smart and all. But I always told them I am not. Although I should be happy, it really hurt to see all my friends do better than me this semester. 2 of my friends didnt take biology and ended up with 3.9 gpas. Two other friends who took biology and similar courses to me ended up with 3.3 and 3.65 gpas. It was extremely hard for me to bring up my grades to them. 

After getting such a low gpa, I feel as though the career I intend to pursue in dentistry is just fading away. I currently have a 3.74 gpa and I have a bad feeling it is going to get lower because classes are just getting harder. It really hurts me that I have no one to talk to, and I never got a gpa below 3.8. people tell me that gpas go up just as easy as they go down, but that is no where near true after doing some calculations. I had this big fear when I entered college, that something like this would happen. I told myself I must focus on getting a high gpa to start with so that it becomes too heavy to bring down later on. But now, I feel like I am going no where. 

To top things all off, I was late applying for volunteer opportunities and community service events involving dentistry to get my hours in because I am inexperienced with volunteer work, making me not so worthy of a future applicant. When I tried to shadow/volunteer at my local dentists, I was turned down because they have new trainees. 

I just wish there was something to put me back on my feet. This semester's gpa just brought me down too much. I have no more desire to eat as much, I can't sleep, and just thinking of my friends who are better off than me and knowing things are getting tougher later on are just making things worse. The biggest thing I am known for all around my friends, peers and teachers, is that I am the most hardworking student they have ever met. I consider this the only smart part about me. But what kills me is when people tell m I deserve this break, because I feel I really don't.

I am extremely sorry for the long post. I just wanted to let it all out and have something to say to someone willing to listen. Thank you so much.

I was studying computer science at the time, and wasn't particularly interested in school. After dropping out, I worked at a tech startup for 1.5 years. Right now, I'm gearing up to start school again in spring of 2016. Working at the startup taught me a lot, and perhaps the biggest thing for me is that I don't want to study computer science any more. I have a lot more financial stability and an interest in physics and math. 

While working at the startup I took some physics and math courses at a local uni as a non-degree student (the assumption was that some of the math courses would be beneficial in the work I was doing). I'm not too keen on returning to my old school even though I left on good standing. Pretty much everyone I know has graduated, and the physics/math departments at my school aren't that strong nor do they focus on the areas I'm interested in. Additionally, my school is located in a rural/suburban area and I'd much rather attend an urban school. I know you cannot transfer after junior year, but considering that I technically didn't complete it and am switching majors, I wanted to know if I might still be eligible as a junior transfer.

1630,PPKDude,1433042203,/r/college/comments/37x4cz/how_bad_do_your_grades_at_the_end_of_senior_year/,"A bit of background:

* I was admitted into UW-Madison earlier this year and that's where I plan to go next year.

* My high school does trimesters instead of semesters

I did really bad on the math final for Precalculus at the end of the year(got a 58%) and it actually dropped my grade down to a 69% for that trimester. However, in the first two trimesters in that class I had a 86% and 81% as my final grades, meaning my cumulative average is a 78%. Also, this was the only class where my grade got worse. All my other grades in other classes were fine and stayed consistently well(A's and B's) the whole year.

Now, here's the thing. My parents obviously got mad at me when they found out about it(I didn't know about it either until they told me). One of the things they mentioned is that they fear that Madison might deny my admission now even though I've already accepted admission and filled out housing applications and applied for placement tests and student orientation.

Although I don't believe anything bad will happen, in the back of my head I am a little worried now about this. I don't think they would revoke my admission because even though my grade did drop, I didn't fail the class and all of my other grades stayed where they were the whole year. I figure that the worst realistic scenario is probably that they might want me to take that class again next year or during the summer, which would suck but at least I would still be going to college next year. My school will be sending out final transcripts within a few days or so.

So, to college counselors and admissions officers of Reddit, should I actually be very worried right now or am I gonna be fine?

Something that really dropped my grade down was a WU (unauthorized withdrawal, basically an F). My school policy is that the first WU would turn into a W(Withdrawal, which does nothing on the GPA). So this WU was stuck there until the end of spring quarter. I was told by the admissions and record people they would fix this. Now it came to the point where I had received the academic disqualification email. If my WU were to change to a W like it was supposed too my GPA would have gone up and be in the area of not being disqualified. At this point the semesters have ended and I do not know what to do during this period of time.Hopefully this Monday I can go into the offices and find a way to fix this. I am scared and lost! Anyone have any suggestion.




Extra Note: Yeah I know it takes a low GPA to begin with to get me to this point.

1632,Zutch,1431951115,/r/college/comments/36d0of/university_student_meltdown_long_post/,"Hello everyone,First of all i would like to that this is my first reddit post, although i have been using reddit for a while,But never posted anything myself.

I seek your advice and your opinion on a personal academic matter that i just cannot contain by myself,I have tried seeking professional help in my university but it was of no use .

My problem is, I am a university student in undergraduate Electrical and Electronic Engineering program, i am 22 years old, and theoretically i am supposed to graduate in 2 semester but in reality am setback at least 2 years.

I am and Introvert by nature, i live alone in 1+1 apartment after living in dorms with roommate(s) for  2 years, i never did drugs or gambling or clubbing,i am a rather quiet person who likes a cup of tea and a good movie in a friday night, on paper this sounds like a nice profile for a scientific path as engineering, but as i revealed, i have setback myself 2 years in progress in my program. and i am at a breaking point of frustration.

My parents know nothing of my situation, i study in a foreign country, far away from my parents, they finance my education and life, so i don't work or get money from the government, another point that'd make engineering choice more appealing to become successful, but i have proven otherwise.

You might wonder by now, then What the heck did you do? seem's like a good life. 

Well i messed up, in my first semester of uni, i didn't take my courses seriously, i was busy with the new thriving social life i had, i had my freedom to play video games as i will, and i had such a blind ego that i kept telling myself, god won't let me fail i am good servant of his.

First semester over, i repeated 4 courses out of 5 (got an A in english...the irony)
i was shocked, i was in tears, here my world started falling apart, in days i am expected to call my parents and tell them the good news of my successful first semester. 

Saddened by my failure, and fear stricken by the reaction of my parents and what their punishment would be (i was afraid they'd disown me or force me to come back home and switch to lesser study field ) once i tell them the exact opposite of their expectation, i decide to hide the truth, lie, so i foraged fake grade report and emailed it to my brother to show them my grades. my family believed it, and were so pleased, i told my self, you messed up the first time you will make up next semester and tell your family the truth, a semester passes by, yet i repeat 2 more courses (math/physics), i was mortified, out of fear and embarrassment i decided to keep lieing to my parents until the foretold day of my redemption of my grades, the day i set straight what once was wrong .

Fast forward... it's 2015 and i yet look back at those 3-4 years,  and i am filled with sadness how i let my ego take over me through all these years, during those 3-4 years i let myself indulge in video games as an escapism of my failure and disappointment, i dropped my social life, kept lieing to my parents, and kept getting sadder and sadder day by day from my failure. like a self inflicting cycle of despair while repeating courses.

During those years, my religiousness was sliding down drastically, i started questioning my religion, i started reading and watching Richard Dawkins series and other Atheist speakers debunk religion and advocate reason and logic, i was filled with rage, how could i have been blinded for so long. i relied on my superstition to  set things right while i sat idle.

I saw one of my good friends whom we started together, graduate with highest honor, i was so sad that day, i knew i could've been as good as he did, but instead i choose bad road, a selfish one, and i paid the price for it.


i am a different person now, i am agnostic and more accepting and open minded, i support and respect many things i haven't before. i have learned and realized so much through my despair .


But i am tired now, the lie is consuming me, it scorned my mind , it alienated my parents away from me, my mom just called me asking me to come home and visit them, but i refused... i refused because whenever i come back, i'd feel so much guilt with every fake smile when my parents congratulate me for my fake grades, so guilty of my cowardliness to speak the truth and face the consequence, i'd feel more depressed then ever, that i created this happiness for them, and the sadness that i will inflict on them once they know all these years of lies and deceit ...

My best friend since kindergarden abandoned me and wished death upon me once i told him about my agnostic uprising, although he was the only one who i'd go to vent off my problems (he studies in a different country ).


But, despite all of this, i never thought of ending my life, even after dropping my religion, i felt even more responsible, and more compelled to keep on, it's not over, am 22 and i am yet to live my life, but i am filled with a burden that just weighs me down so hard... like a large stone set against my chest...difficult to breath and live...



Now you might wonder how could i let myself fuck up this hard, to be truely honest, i do not know, as i stated i am not drug addict or alcoholic ( although i tried Wine out of curiosity during my religious rebellion ), i don't go to clubs or do crazy things...

You might also tell me that many engineering is just not the right thing for me, i disagree, i love science and technology, i read more about technology more than i ever read anything in high school , i love science and innovation, but ...i do not know how did i let myself astray for so long.


For this i seek your advice, i am sorry for the 5.5k~ words but i wanted to vent, keeping secrets is truly an agonizing thing. 


Thank you ..So much for your time.

But then I get a bill saying $237 had been paid from financial aid and I owed another like $700. I filled out withdrawal stuff after the census date (here apparently they punish you for not going to class by kicking you out of the class and still making you pay) and three of the four classes were dropped but one had been paid for by financial aid I shouldn't have gotten.

Now they want me to pay the $237 for a class I never took and for financial aid I should not have gotten. Is there any way out of this?

I'm a really, really terrible student. I'm the sort of person that, halfway through college I'm still just straight up not showing up or not doing homework (and double majoring in math and philosophy no less, so huge portions of my grades rely on it). Even if I do homework, sometimes I'll take a 0 before I turn in an assignment that I haven't completed. It's the same thing with quizzes (another large portion of the grade): if I feel I am shaky on material I will sometimes just not go rather than do poorly. This has resulted in a 2.7 GPA that has been absolutely all over the place, and frankly I'm surprised it's even that high. Obviously, I recognize the faults in these behaviors, and those times when I am consistent studying I can achieve good results. Sometimes the late nights studying will pay off in the most ridiculous ways and I'll get an A on a 20 page paper that was supposed to take weeks in only a night of work, or be near the top of a curve on a calculus test because I stumbled across the fountain of youth of studying strategies. Inevitably, these situations have become farther and farther away from each other, and I've never been so aware of that until now. Those are the things I can change.

What I'm afraid I can't change, is two-fold:

1. I'm a second semester sophomore whose semester is finishing up, and I'm **horrifically** far behind in my Linear Algebra class. I missed about two and a half weeks of school because of an abscess in my throat (as often as I fool myself into thinking I'm actually sick, you'd think I would have been more capable of dealing with actually being sick). I kicked my ass to get caught up on the midterm that I got pushed back to the week I expected to recover, and probably would have done decently well had I not gotten a bad sinus infection that Monday (and I want to reiterate that these are not feigned illnesses nor excuses to miss class; I wish I had been able to take the exam). My professor told me that I could take the final as my midterm, resulting in the final being worth a whopping 45% of my grade. In the meantime, I did very little to stay caught up. I attended class, but I only did about half of the homework assignments and missed at least one quiz. I kept pushing my studying back, and even when started it was always late at night and I was incapacitated with exhaustion the next day. I didn't request a leave of absence, I didn't go to office hours, I fucking missed a makeup quiz, and dropped probably my easiest class a yet inexplicable reason. All of the opportunities I had to rectify or postpone this semester (at least as far as this class are concerned) are gone. I might be able to scrape a C in the class, but if I do I won't deserve it at all. Any suggestions regarding cramming/anything related to walking into an exam worth 45% of one's grade completely unprepared would be welcome. This is a class I've taken before (though, granted under an extremely poor teacher and I retook it not because I didn't pass but because I felt I didn't learn anything), and is a class that I need to get a C or higher in to earn my major.

2. Every single time I approach finals season I find myself in this dilemma. I realize how fucked I am and what a terrible student I am, generally whipping myself into a first class frenzy instead of taking what time I have left to study. When I end up passing with mediocre to poor grades (I've been sitting at a B- average the entirety of my time at college), I swear that I'll do the right thing the next semester. And I do know what the right thing is, it just never ends up getting done. At this point in my college experience, when I've halfway determined how this is all going to turn out (excepting summer classes or additional years - which I'll get to later), it's obvious that this is no longer an easy thing to convince myself of. As crass as I've come off in this post, I've frankly been more down in the past couple of weeks than I have in a very long time. My room's a mess, I don't really have any food to eat, I don't hang out with my friends very often. I just inefficiently study and sleep. I really know I can do it, because there are long moments when I've tried hard and done well. But I just don't, again and again. I'm so embarrassed that I've backed myself into a corner of lies to my friends and family and they don't know how poorly this is all going, and I can't even tell my therapist (whom I've continued seeing since I started seeing her last year because of some drug abuse) because it's like speaking it makes it more true. 

It's true that this semester was unusually difficult for me because of pledging a fraternity, initially working almost 28 hours (another instance of me actively choosing to do something extremely difficult - my parents just said that I had to get a job and I picked hard labor in warehouse at nearly 30 hours a week), getting very sick and staying that way for a while, but even though I tell myself that and have told my mom that this semester won't go well because of that, I know that the underlying issue is that I'm ultimately not a good student. What's more, my laziness turns into really awful self-hatred and manic motivation that leads me to go up to 48 hours on only a few hours of sleep. 

Almost done, after a very lengthy post. I'm lucky enough to be going to a good school that my parents are paying for completely. Summer classes and extra years are on the table financially (and the two summer classes I've taken have resulted in some of my more successful classes), though obviously this would be something I'd like to avoid. Both my mom and my dad have doctorates and very highly value education, though my dad went through a similar experience his freshman year. They're very supportive and I would suspect my mom has an idea of what's going on, but despite the financial capability  they have my overriding feeling is guilt that I'm flushing this all down the toilet. 

Obviously, this is a complex issue and in retrospect I don't know if I would read through a post this long. I'd be extremely grateful to anyone with any sort of advice, anecdote, or outright criticism. Please be honest with me reddit, because I've gotten to the point where I don't even know how to be honest with myself.

**I need help, guys :(.**

In high school I was a super-awesome student (4.0 GPA, 36 ACT, EC's abound), so I figured college at a state university would be... well, not much harder.  I joined the Honors Program, got a full-ride scholarship (plus two grand a year), and figured I was set.

Problem: my advisor and I picked the most difficult classes we could for my freshman year.  I ended up with a 3.17 GPA after the first semester, with B-'s in Advanced Chemistry and Honors Calc II (after taking just a laid-back, non-AP Calc I in high school).  I needed a 3.5 to keep my scholarship and Honors Program status, but thankfully they have a one-semester grace period.

I studied my ass off - I took slightly easier classes, and knew I needed three A's and a B+ (knowing that Honors Calc III would be the B+, as it's the hardest one) and I worked.  Now I'm getting my grades back this week.

First one: Physics Lab: A

Second one: Calc III: C-

...

Those are the only two grades I've received as of yet, but I feel like it doesn't matter.  I've lost the scholarship, the Honors Program, everything that distinguished me as anything but average.  I had had a B in the class before the final, and I felt confident leaving the testing center, but apparently I failed it.  Badly.  I really don't know how, but it's over now.

My other classes should be A+'s, A's, or at worst A-'s, but it doesn't matter.  Thousands of dollars, gone; my chance at grad school at MIT, gone; my confidence in my intellect, gone.  What do I do, guys?

I already sent a much-more-professional, much-less-panicky email with a similar message to my academic advisor, and she'll probably get back to me on Monday.  I plan to appeal the loss of scholarship (a path that apparently successfully worked for my roommate's sister) with the reasoning that I was adjusting to college (which is what said sister also had happen).  After all, I'm only 17, I've never really had to study before in my life (so although I did a lot, I might not have done so very well?  If that's a thing), and I did literally take the hardest course path possible for my freshman year.

I haven't told my parents yet, but I will next week after my advisor replies and the rest of my grades are in.  They'll be disappointed, but they've told me before that even if I can't keep the scholarship, it'll be okay.

I dropped many classes from my community college for it and now I am even more extremely behind in school, as I couldn't attend right after high school because of military training.

Is it possible for me to apply straight to a university as if I never attended the community college? I do not care about transferring what I have completed at the community college.

I'm a junior in high school at Niles West and I'm in a bad situation. I am a semi-hardworking student with good grades most of the time, but this year has been the plight of my schooling. I have a 3.2 unweighted GPA, but a 3.7 GPA weighted GPA since I take Honors and AP classes (no regular besides freshman year). I usually average a B, and that's without trying my hardest. I know I can get an A if I tried as hard as I possibly could. That's not the problem however. Last semester (I'm in my second semester), I finished very poorly. I got a D in AP Physics, a C in AP U.S. History, a C in Pre-Calculus, and everything else A and B. My GPA fell to a 3.7 because of that semester. This semester looks like the same situation. I have a D in AP Physics, a C in AP U.S. History, a C in FPC, and a C in my gym class because of stupid app-related issues that determines my whole grade. Everything else is A and B. I am also an all year round athlete (Cross Country in the fall, Track &amp; Field in the winter and spring), but I didn't do Track &amp; Field this year at all (I did Cross Country and I dropped my best times - nothing record-breaking though). I plan to continue sports next year as well. So you might be thinking, my gosh, two D's and a lot of C's? Good luck, you'll need it. The problem is that I've had the worst year of home life this year. I come home stressed from academics and my relationship to be verbally abused sometimes or to watch my parents scream at each other, with my nine year old sister watching or listening, or both. My mother cries to herself in the dark so we don't see, but we always do (my sister and I that is), and I go to school only to constantly get reminded of my terrible home life, and this happens everyday. I ended up telling my physics teacher about it and now I am going to receive counseling for this issue. Does Loyola care? Would they understand? I plan to take more AP classes next year to redeem myself to show them  who I really am. Please help me; and be honest. I don't want to create false hopes.

Edit: I didn't take any AP exams this year due to financial problems and no confidence in my scores due to grades and home life. I'm scared that will also screw me over. ",college,I'm freaking out.

1640,sf90,1430622150,/r/college/comments/34oohe/ive_been_going_to_a_four_year_university_for/,"**Please note that yes, I know that I fucked up my ""college career"" so far. I take full responsibility for this and realize that it is entirely my fault. However, I just want honest advice moving forward.**

Okay, so I'm currently ending my third year of college and it's been awful. I'm in Computer Engineering, my GPA is right above a 2.0, and I'm like a year behind. I've had immense trouble in my classes, even with going to office hours, hiring private tutors, and spending insane amounts of time studying. After having dropped a class for the third(!) time this quarter last weekend after discovering that I did poorly on a midterm (after studying my brains out), I spoke to multiple councilors on campus and have decided that I'm going to need to do something else moving forward. I've done some soul searching and determined that these are probably the four reasons I didn't do well:

-I have a learning disability, and I didn't properly utilize my accommodations for this.  To clarify, I've actually had accommodations since freshmen year. However, one of these accommodations was for a reduced courseload, because I learn slowly and have anxiety. I didn't use this accommodation because I figured I could just succeed if I study way more than anyone else, and I knew that if I used it then I'd be stuck in college for more than four years. Well, this worked out at the beginning of college but it ended up causing me trouble around the time Sophomore year began because I just couldn't keep up with my coursework or even the professors' lectures. 

-I don't like my major. Yeah, I know it's kinda ridiculous that I've been in a major I don't like for three years without changing, but again I accept full responsibility for the situation I'm in. For the first year and a half or so of college I had thoughts that I didn't really like computer engineering, but I kept telling myself that I'd like it more once I get further in the major and I should just continue. For about the second year and a half I realized and accepted that I disliked computer engineering, but I told myself to continue because I didn't want to disappoint my family and I wanted the salary that comes with a computer engineering job. And I figured ""Well, hopefully I'll get stuck in something that's relatively menial, easy, and simple for my field"". After taking some of the upper-division computer engineering courses though I just don't think I can do this at all. My brain is just not suited to solving logical puzzles, and that's basically what computer engineering is all about. Some of these concepts just seem impossible for me to wrap my head around even asking the professor dozens of times, and checking my code for errors is just the most tedious and frustrating thing I've ever done in my life. 

-I don't really like my college. My university goes on the quarter system, and everything just seems to go by so quickly. One of the councilors I spoke to highly recommends that I switch to a university that goes on a semester system, since she seemed to believe that quarters cause me a lot of difficulty. Additionally, I just don't like the atmosphere here. Everything seems to go by quickly. And just in general, there's something I don't like. I don't really like it socially either; people are kinda jerks, and they form cliques like it's high school or something. I don't really have any close friends; I never talk to anyone in classes and no one tries to talk to me, and while some of my roommates have been cool, others have been jerks, and I always get the impression that they only tolerate me or something. I haven't joined any clubs or gone to any parties or anything (though I realize I could change that). I also live really close (like, 10 minutes away) to my parents' home. This was actually a positive for me when I first applied and the major reason I went to this university, since I love my parents so much and wasn't really ready to live independently. And while I still love my parents a lot, I'm starting to worry that if I can't get away from them then I'll never learn to truly become an adult. All of this could be tolerable if I were to just be at this college for another year or two, but if I'm going to change majors then it could take me longer, and I just don't think I could stand being here.  Plus I want to restart my GPA so it's not so low. 

-I have depression. I've been depressed since towards the end of Freshmen year, primarily for the other three reasons. Depression just makes it harder to succeed. I know I said that I work hard and study really hard, but sometimes, some weeks or days or quarters, I just don't have it in me, and I end up laying in bed all day instead. I finally mustered up the courage to see a school psychologist last week (and yes, again, I know it's my fault for not doing this earlier). 

So, all four of the above factors have made it really difficult to succeed. What do you recommend moving forward? The plan I have in mind involves transferring to a community college (assuming I can't transfer to a four year straight from here, which I don't think I can with my GPA), changing my major, and then going to a four year college. The only worry I have with this plan is that I could potentially not do well in the CC, and then I'll be screwed over and end up in an even worse situation than I'm in now. It's also important to note that while I don't like my current university, it is generally considered to be a great college that offers lots of job/internship opportunities after graduation, and I'm scared to lose that. In terms of majors I'm kind of considering changing to Accounting. From what I've read some people consider it boring, but it seems to involve a lot of arithmetic/algebra, which I'm skilled at and did well in during middle/high school (as opposed to college Calculus, which just confuses the hell out of me). I also know it involves working with spreadsheets and doing work of that nature a lot, and while I know a lot of people find that menial and boring, in my (limited) experience I actually find it kind of soothing and relaxing. I also know that accounting pays decently (though not as well as engineering)/has a lot of job opportunities. If that doesn't work out I could major in Biology, English, Journalism, or a foreign language (Spanish or Japanese I guess). Does this seem like a good idea, or should I think about a different major? Also, does anyone have any suggestions for the four year college that I could eventually transfer to? I'd like to go somewhere that offers a lot of resources to students like me that have had academic issues, or have some kind of a learning disability (and again, goes on Semester system). I'd also like to go somewhere in Oregon or Washington; I currently live in NorCal, and I like the idea of moving away from my parents and ""starting anew,"" somewhere, but not too far away from my parents so that I'm across the country or something.

I was a good student in high school for 9th and 10th grade. Then I came down with a very debilitating immunological illness which caused my grades to suffer in 11th and 12th grade. I was in a pretty bad place due to how sick I was and dropped out in my senior year with only 25 credits remaining to graduate. I did take the GED test and scored 91%. My academic GPA for high school is 3.110 and my A-G GPA is 3.68 even though I did not complete them all (I am missing some foreign language classes). I have been working with a great doctor the past 6 months and have been treating my illness to great success. I am now in complete remission with tons of energy. I go to the gym 5x a week and work. I am fully ready to attend college and after launch a career in finance, something I've wanted to do since high school.

Since college is possible for me now I initially planned on doing community college and transferring to a good university. But I want to see if I can go straight into a uni, even an average one and transfer to a top school. From my understanding most universities require all the A-G classes and I am missing a few.

I know I'm smart, I don't mean to sound like I'm bragging or that I'm better than everyone, I just felt like it's kind of important (granted dropping out of school wasn't very bright but I had a lot of personal and family issues). There's a local community college near me, but they don't really have a wide variety of courses (or any that really interest me besides maybe graphic design and English) and I'd really love to leave this state as soon as possible. I also haven't taken the ACT yet if that matters. I've had a few careers in mind, such as being a lawyer, a federal law enforcement officer (FBI, ICE, USMS, etc.), being a high school teacher or counselor, or being a graphic designer.



My dad really disapproves of me wanting to be a LEO because he thinks I'd be wasting my intelligence and that I should ""go into computers."" I like working with computer hardware but I really don't like programming at all (the only thing I can stand is web development). I know if I wanted to be a LEO, majoring in Criminal Justice would be a dumb idea, so I would probably major in a language like Russian or something else that interests me. I've always been a good writer and I love helping people in need (plus, I absolutely love movies and books like 12 Angry Men or To Kill a Mockingbird, I know they do not portray real lawyers/trials accurately at all, but it's the idea behind it, justice, that I really adore) so I figured being a lawyer would be a good idea. However, everywhere I go, I read about law school graduates being in a ton of debt with no job prospects and that law schools don't teach you what you need to know and it's pretty much a big scam. In regards to being a teacher or a counselor, as I said earlier, I love helping people, and I was lucky to have so many great teachers and counselors who helped me through tough times and inspired me to learn more and try my best, and I'd really love to be on the giving end of that. But everywhere I go, I read about teachers who hate their job, who get paid horribly, how the government is screwing up the education system, and again how there are no job prospects. In regards to graphic design, I love messing around in GIMP, making pretend logos, custom wallpapers, fixing photos, stuff like that, it's about the only thing I actually enjoy doing besides playing games and talking to my friends. Again though, I read about how the pay is shit and the job market is even worse.

I had six classes: four dual-enrollment college classes listed as ""One Semester"" and two Honors High School classes listed as ""Full year"". The App only asked for the classes I was currently enrolled in and I had nowhere to put future, spring classes (and I didn't know what I'd be taking in the spring at the time anyway; I filled the app out in September!)

Once spring came around I stopped taking both of the high school classes in lieu of taking 4 new advanced college courses and regular high school physics instead of honors (there's hardly a change, but the end of honors project took me so much time that I felt it was best to switch so that I'd continue to do well in all of my classes. My college load was a lot harder this semester but I continue to do well). For Spring, they only had me down for taking honors physics and honors literature, so technically I upgraded my class load from what it was on the app. I know that they discipline and even rescind acceptance for people exaggerating their future classes in their applications, but while I dropped the honors label on one of my classes, I also took up four additional college classes than I listed, so I'm actually doing more advanced work than I even mentioned. 

Do I need to let them know? They will receive my transcripts soon anyway, and I don't see them being too dissatisfied by my work as a student only improving and doing more rigorous work than planned, but I don't want them to think I'm a liar or something and rescind my acceptance.

Well because I had a really bad GPA in high school I had to go with a transfer pathway at my Community College. My original transfer pathway degree was information systems, but I have wanted to change my major to Geology, but can't because my CC doesn't offer that. Anyways I started with 5 classes last semester and dropped 1, and stopped going to another by the last 2 months. I made a D in English 1, music appreciation, and American history 1.

Because I made below a 19 on the math portion of my ACT (I made a 21 composite so not good at all) I had to take remedial type of math to take the regular math classes needed for my transfer. I ended up stop going to that class because I was in the middle of a falling out between me and my dad while I was still living with him. I was extremely depressed last semester and it took a lot for me to even go to the 3 classes I had left.

This semester I came back with a better attitude, but things quickly went downhill from there. I started with 5. Speech, Remedial Math, computer applications, American history 2, and Theater. I dropped the Computer App class pretty quickly because It started at 4PM while all my other classes were early ones. I just couldn't do that because It interfered with my work schedule . Next was speech. My deal with speech wasn't giving the speeches it was writing them. I have never been good at writing essays. I have like permanent writers block, and after struggling for the first 2 months I dropped that class. I dropped theatre because I had to start working more to pay some of my bills. I dropped remedial math again, because I started to give up. I felt like I just wasn't ever going to finished this. I couldn't pass competency 2 after 11 takes, and by then I was behind everyone. American History 2 is the only class left and I am actually doing really good in it.

So I started with 5 classes and ended with 1.

I fucked up really really bad. This was a complete waste of money and just a complete lost year for me. I don't know what to do. I can't do summer classes, because its 5 days a week and I can't afford to drive back and forth everyday. its only 15 miles away but my truck doesn't get good gas.

I really need some help. I need at least 30 credits to transfer to MTSU. I am in a panic and don't know what to do.

If you want to skip that and just answer the question then there is a tl;dr at the bottom. I should also add that I did speak to my adviser already and he gave me very little insight. Honestly I felt very brushed off.

I'm a 21 year old female who attended a university one year right out of high school. I immediately started struggling, ended up losing my scholarships, and realized I'm no where near ready for college so told my mom I was dropping out. She spent the next few months basically telling me that if I drop out I'll amount to nothing and fail at life and stupid me believed her. So I applied for community college since I couldn't afford my university anymore and took four classes. I immediately started struggling again and became even more depressed then I was beforehand. Ended up dropping one class and getting a C, D, and F in the rest. My mom gave up on me and so I dropped out of college, now with a terrible GPA (before Comm College I was right below the requirement for my scholarships, now I'm below a 2.0). I've spent the past two years working on myself and last year I finally felt like I was ready for college. So that brings me to now, I'm currently retaking the three classes I did terribly on last and am going from there.

My main issue is that I am terrible at science. It just doesn't click. I have two options for how I want to do this. I can either take my remaining science course during the summer so I can purely focus on it, though it will be at a very fast pace and I do have a 4 day vacation at Bonnaroo already planned and paid for in that time (I would miss two days of class and one lab). Or I can take it during the fall or spring semester and have a really heavy load, which could become overwhelming and leave me with not enough time to study properly for the class. The only other option I really see other than those two is to have three really light regular semesters, which would be nice but still a lot of money and time wasted.

I tried looking through here but all I kept finding were stories of people hating it and failing. Is it really that terrible?

tl;dr I dropped out of college with horrible grades, came back and now one of my best options of finishing community college by spring semester of 2016 is taking a science summer course, which I am terrible at.

 Next year I will probably attend a community college just so I can be back in a school environment and get credits and whatnot. 

But after that I’m not so sure. Does anyone know of good dual degree programs with art and another field of study? Or of any liberal arts colleges with solid art programs?

1653,myrloc,1426132735,/r/college/comments/2yrcrn/chances_of_getting_into_cs_program_at_current/,"Here's my story in brief:
Graduated top 7% in high school, qualifying me for automatic admission to University of Texas at Austin. Enrolled in 2013 as Electrical and Computer Engineering major. Very optimistic, but with little idea of what the major implied. First semester I faced the usual terribly difficult weed out circuits course. Alsobmade very few friends and develop some anxiety. Dropped circuits course and undeclared myself off of bad advice from a general engineering advisor. Next semester, enrolled in various liberal arts courses to explore other fields. I really enjoyed the second ECE class I took first semester, Into to Computing (mostly programming), so I applied for CS on the assurance of guarantees admission. Summer comes around and so do rejection letter to me and a number of other applicants. Everyone is upset because of their promise for admission; turns out funding is bad and they don't have any room. 

Skip ahead to this semester. I've been preparing to apply to CS once again (taking 4 courses this semester as prerequisite to apply and for CS degree). But, in a recent email from a CS professor with 15 years in the department, I am told I'm ""screwed."" He did not sugar coat it. Apparently this is the ""worst time to be a UT undergraduate.""

This leaves me with quite a stress on my shoulders. So far, UT has been a mediocre experience in an academic sense. Classes are typically huge and I've had very little connection with my professor or what I'm studying. Very little ties me to the school. Right now, the cost, the name, and the friends I've made are what is keeping me. I'm an ambitious guy with big dreams, a decent GPA (3.35), and lots of credits. I would be happy to start over/transfer my credits to another college. Hell, I'd be happy dropping out and going to a 'coding bootcamp' (my parents aren't as enthusiastic about the idea). The whole situation has gotten me quite down on the university and I'm considering every option. Community college in California and transfer to a UC school? How about some here else? Europe or another place abroad? My family is not limited in money, but I refuse to pay a giant sum of money for an overrated college education.

Then I went to college.

My first semester I gained 50lbs tried to kill myself twice, I made friends with the weird kids, my roommate hated me, I failed a class, and I developed insomnia. I quickly did damage control, dropped out and went home to my local community college. I graduated with the Associates Degree in Science in September 2014. I then attempted to go back to a four-year school (a different one than my first attempt) and I was met with the most crippling anxiety I have ever experienced. I would go to class and feel so out of place, I didn't belong, I couldn't fit in the seats, my books were old and used, I was so stupid, everyone could see how stupid and ugly and fat I was, they knew I didn't belong. So I'd run home and cry and I dropped out for a second time.

I really want to go back. I want to work in a lab as a biologist some day but I can't afford it now and I have wasted so much time and money on failing. Why would another try be any different?

As I sit here looking for jobs several months out of college, I see no prospects with the social science degree I earned, and on top of all that, I have no fond memories of college. Few memories that really stick out with me, you know, the ones you want to hold on to forever. Right now, college is just some haze that I don't like to think about too much. I have been meaning to write this post for awhile now, but was conflicted on how to format and direct it. Take it as you will though, advice or not, but here it goes.

You know those cliché portrayals you see of college life in the movies and on TV and all? You know, the ones where you have the time of your life, hook up with all the girls (this is from a male's perspective btw sorry!), and become the main man on campus? Yeah. Get rid of that. All of it. I found that the worst thing to do in college was to hold too tight to expectations. I wanted that college experience, the nights out that you remember forever, lasting friendships, the best 4 years of your life. Well, in the process of attaining that, it is easy to spend most of your time stressing out and worrying about how you haven't reached that yet. The truth is, that while some nights are fantastic, most nights are just average, and all those wild raging parties? Well, sometimes they aren't all that fun anyway, it depends on the type of person you are. Which leads me to my next point, 

You don’t need to try to be anyone you aren’t. Really! You will see plenty of guys, PLENTY, who appear to be the life of the party, and while you might be asking yourself why that can’t be you, you are not realizing how unique and special you already are. Find your own niche in college. Sure, try out the party scene for a bit when you first start out, but realize there is more to college than just that! If you have fun with it, awesome, but if you do not, and don’t enjoy drinking, don’t feel like every Friday night has to be a drunken ragefest. There are so many other things you can focus on in college. Yes I understand, it is almost impossible to avoid alcohol and partying in college, but my point is that doesn’t have to be you if you don’t want it to be. Which leads me to my next advice…

GET INVOLVED. Seriously. Do it. I know how hokey it can sound to join school clubs, because I felt the same way. Freshman year I felt I had to make my OWN social life, so I negated all the offers I came across to join clubs, and I totally regret it now. And not just clubs, just campus events in general, guest lectures, something volunteer related, a writing group, a science club, anything! I made most of my friends this way. And all the students I met at a freshmen wandering the town with looking for parties? Half of them dropped out freshman year, and the rest I never spoke to again. Don’t let anybody tell you who should and shouldn’t be your friends. Only you can decide this.

And now onto one of the most difficult dilemmas of college life, balancing academics and a social life. Well, to be honest, there is no one answer to this, because everyone is difference. Some people can ace exams with only a night's worth of studying, others need weeks of studying just to barely pass (that’s me right there). The big question of which is more important, a social life, or your career can be a huge stress inducer in college. Of course school work is the most important we will all think at first. Grades grades grades! That’s why we went to college right?? Wait… but what about the “college experience”? And making friends? And creating memories? Aren’t these supposed to be the best four years of my LIFE?? What if I am not actually enjoying myself? What if I really am spending too much time studying and not enough time enjoying life? I mean you only get four years and you will never relive them again! 

And so you see, this can be quite the issue. And here is my best advice. Combine them. Yup. Plenty of disciplines and major fields in college have clubs and activities attached to them. Go to lectures with people from your classes. Go to career mixers related to your field. Try making friends with people in your classes, etc. A social life doesn’t have to revolve around just going out and randomly finding parties. You can hang out with people who share your academic interests and in the process encourage one another to succeed. Trust me, my science major friends always party together. They have crazy fun and also do crazy good research.

As far as choosing a major? Oh boy this is a hard one. Mainly because there is no real answer to the conflict of what you love to study vs. what you should study. My best advice here is to think about what kind of degree you would love to say you have. Try this. Think of yourself maybe 5 or 10 years out of college at a party with other professionals, and someone asks you. “Oh what did you study in college?” What would you like to answer to them? What would you feel proud of having earned a degree in? Think about it for a bit, and realize you can start working towards that right now. As far as what is a good degree to pursue, well that doesn’t really matter. I am a firm believer that NO major is superior to any other major. You can excel at ANY major. Don’t let anyone tell you that you chose a “party major” or your major isn’t actually a “real” major. If you are passionate about it, stick to it, take every opportunity that comes with it, take any internship you can that comes with it, learn everything you can about it, and then see who comes out on top. As for what to DO with that degree? Well as someone who is having trouble trying to find out what to do with their degree, and is having great difficulty with it is well… I wasn’t prepared. I chose my major on a whim because I didn’t know what else to do. Please don’t do this. This is not a good way to choose a major. This is why I believe it is CRUCIAL to explore all you can freshman year. Talk to other students. Look at those bulletin boards you see around campus. See any cool study abroad opportunities? Any cool fellowships or internships? What fields are they in? What field makes you say wow that’s pretty cool! What field makes you think wow those people seem so smart! What field makes you say to yourself, wow I would love to be in that field! That is a good starting place. As for jobs after college, research what you can actually do with such a degree, and if the names of possible positions sound good to you, then awesome! You might have figured out a potential path!

So that’s all I have time to jot down for now. I hope it wasn’t too long. I just wanted to share this with people here. I apologize if my writing seems a bit sloppy and doesn’t reflect that I have a college degree, but honestly I am so tired of writing professional sounding cover letters that I just wanted to write this as it came into my head. I hope this helps new students with adjusting to your college life. I realize my words will not apply to everyone, but I hope people gain at least a little something from them. Don’t feel pressured to live college any one way. It’s your four years to make of it what you wish. Oh and also take some risks. Sit next to that group at the dining hall, raise your hand in that GE class, and talk to that cute girl who sits in the front of the lecture hall. Just do it. Take note of something she said during lecture and then ask her about it after class. Trust me. Take the risk. Don’t be me and sit at home 4 years later wondering why you never took the chance and what could have come. 

And so I wish you well in college and hope you have a successful experience whether you haven’t started yet, or already have. You will be bombarded with new influences and perspectives, and this is all great. But remember to always be true to yourself. I made so many mistakes in college that I wish I could do over. What I would give to start those four years all over again. I chose a major on a whim, largely just followed my dorm mates in whatever they thought was cool and followed them to whatever parties they knew of, and was always too shy to talk to that cute girl in my class.
To me the most important lesson is to just be yourself. No really. I know you probably hear it all the time and it sounds corny, but it’s true. Even if you are shy and introverted like me, people might just like you for it :)

Back in 9th grade, I was nearing my limit when it came to tolerating traditional school; I just couldn't deal with waking up early to go somewhere I hated, and my grades suffered because of it. I was failing the majority of my primary classes with nothing better than a C- for my elective. I knew I could do better, much better, but I didn't care enough to take action. I dragged myself around school for that entire year, hating every minute of it. As my first year in high school was nearing its last few months before Summer, my counsellor called me into her office and explained to me that I'd need to go to Summer school, due to my lack of credits, so I did. I was sent to a charter school to make up those credits, until school resumed for 10th grade. I liked the charter school's program so much more than my, then, currently enrolled school, that I actually convinced my mom to let me go there instead. It turned out, that allowing me to go there was a good decision, as being able to do work on my own time improved my grades exponentially; my GPA went from around 1.9, to 3.8 by 11th grade. Had I not discovered that school, I may have been doomed, college/career-wise. Later on, I got lazy again. I was turning in work at a slower pace, but still passing with at least a B or B-. Eventually, that slow pace put me in another bad spot. I was becoming too old(turned 18) to safely continue in their school, without the risk of being dropped. After being made aware of this, I had to look elsewhere to complete my remaining requirements. I'm currently enrolled in an adult school to earn the 20 remaining credits that I need to get my diploma, but I'm having extreme difficulty staying motivated to do my work. I'm also moderately depressed due to some other negative factors in my life that aren't improving, so that makes it that much harder for me. The reason I've come seeking advice(hopefully from the right sub?)is because I'm considering taking an alternative high school equivalency test, so I can stop bearing the immense weight that still being in high school has put on me. The CHSPE and HiSET are what i was looking into. Take not that i plan on going to a community college and transferring to a university afterwards.

I have not gotten all of my letters back from colleges, but I have been rejected by a few so far. I applied to several SUNY schools, but only applied to CCNY for CUNY. I want to apply to more CUNY schools, but my application on the CUNY portal says that I can't apply twice for the Fall semester. 

Quick question about CCNY:
They required an essay were you had to ""write about an experience you've had with engineering"". I wrote about a C program I wrote in a CS50 (free online CS class by Harvard). It showed my critical thinking skills and my passion for the work. Do you guys think that was a good thing to write about? (Engineering = C Programming in EE?)

I plan on majoring in electrical engineering (4 YEAR PROGRAM NOT 2 YEAR TECH). I noticed that I would have basically no debt if I went to a legitimate community college for 2 years and transferred into a SUNY/CUNY as a junior. I hear that credits don't always transfer and that would be a huge waste of time and money. Kingsborough seems to have credits that transfer to most SUNY/CUNY schools for engineering, but from what I've read the school is not very good. I am only interested in applying to SUNY and CUNY schools, other schools in and out of state will put me in debt. 

A few bad grades dropped my gpa throughout early high school to a 83.33 weighted average. The classes were easy, my laziness killed me. I take the blame for being so stupid and not focusing on my school work. I kicked my video game addiction and I fixed my work ethic. 

I have an sat score around the national average, and I didn't study the first time before it. Even if I do get accepted into a school 4 year school, should I consider taking the sat and working really hard to get a good score? I hear that employers love to look at your SAT scores, especially if you are doing serious work such as engineering.

I messed up in high school and my grades are better now. If you guys have any good advice or know any other good community colleges in NYC that transfer credits to SUNY/CUNY schools please comment below. Thanks for the help.

Basically what happend was that I missed a test because I had to go to the hospital and since the teacher drops the lowest test score he said ""Don't worry about it.""

Then the last test of the semester came around and the class average was a 32/100 so naturally that became the dropped test for most people. I scored a 36 on the test, above the average but still abysmal (The average on the test I missed was a 66). After the test professor was out and didn't respond to my emails about my dropped test (I sent one and then a second one 2 days later reminding him about my situation)

I heard nothing from him and he showed up for the final but left almost right away so I didn't get a chance to talk to him. We don't get finals grades back and I wasn't feeling confident about the final either. Now I'm not accusing him of ignoring me or deliberately snubbing me but I don't know what to do. I ended up getting a D in the class, which is passing at my school but still not good for my GPA, I had 3 A's and 1 B other than this class, I currently have a 3.2 GPA which is slightly above average.

I am not at that school right now as I had surgery done over the break as the issue could be fatal if left alone and the doctor told me not to travel for a month so I took classes at my old college instead of missing a month of class there, so there is no way for me to talk to him in person. I tried calling his office once and left a message but he never called back (he stated in his syllabus that e-mail was the best way to reach him). I was afraid to send him another email as I was hoping to do research with him and if I come off as a pest he may not select me as a Lab Assistant.

How should I approach this situation? Should I just accept that I probably got a D in the class on my own merit or should I try to get my grade up because of the unusual circumstances? Additionally will this hurt my chances of getting into a top grad school or will they understand that this was an outlier and see this as a viable explanation

At the beginning of January, I decided I was tired of community college and applied for admission into the University of Houston as an electrical engineering major. They let me in. 

I am near horrendously ill-informed about college stuff. What would you you recommend I do if you were in my situation.

* Went to a 4-year university straight out of high school as your typical naive kid who thought he was smarter than he really was (had 4.0 in high school, 2300+ SAT, APs, etc)
* Got a 2.8 first semester
* Signed up for a sophomore/junior-level load of courses in my second semester being the idiot I was, didn't even consult my advisor. I was already ahead in terms of credits and it made sense to me at the time, since I could graduate a semester early at that rate and save a good chunk of money.
* Couldn't handle the independence in college, wasted too much time with friends and didn't care enough about my classes. Decided to just get by in college rather than excel.
* Ended up getting a 0.9 GPA at the end of my second semester. It's depressing thinking about how hard I failed, but it's what happened.
* Got dropped from the university and they told me to apply a year afterwards, I asked to be put on probation but was denied.
* Went to CC for a year, reapplied (with a 3.3 GPA) and got denied in my reapplication process.

I'm pretty lost at the moment. My overall GPA is still horrible now (&lt;2.5) because of that single painfully bad semester in freshman year. My original university does not want me back, and I don't really think any other college is going to want me either with this on my record. And what makes it worse is that I want to study Computer Science, and it's usually one of the most competitive majors at any college.

Does anyone have any experience with anyone in this sort of situation? I've talked to multiple counselors at my local community college but they can't really give me any definitive help.

If there was a way to just get a fresh start somewhere, I would be so happy, but due to the credits I have gathered in the past few years, is this even remotely possible? Or am I forced to apply as a transfer student everywhere?

I recently applied to some local state colleges near my area (I'm based in san jose so San Jose State University), but looking at their transfer acceptance rates for people with my GPA my chances are slim at best. 

I honestly don't know what to do. Two years ago my future was so clear, and now I'm someone that I wouldn't have been able to recognize back then.

1672,[deleted],1422204370,/r/college/comments/2tmi9t/want_to_make_more_friends_in_college_life_help/,"Hi everyone! I'm a sophomore in my second semester of college. Although I do have friends, I don't have a ton. I have around 8-10 friends I go back to and the rest are all people I say hi and hello to. This is going to be a long post so bear with me!

Background: I was always shy in high school but I was more of once you got to know me I can be extremely extroverted and happy! I had a set group of friends and that was fine but I couldn't be friends with the rest of my graduating class. When I left high school for college and made friends freshman year, I was relieved because I made more in that year than I did in my 4 years of high school.

However, you can't be friends with everyone. My shyness has put me back and I tried rushing for a sorority this year and although I did get houses that called me back, most of them didn't and I dropped out realising that I'd rather be alone in a college than in a sorority and that I didn't want to be in a sorority just for the sake of being in one. I wanted to be in a good one and I fell in love with the sororities I thought I would hate, only for them to cut me the next round. You can imagine the blow to my self-esteem. I cried to my mum for ages. 

I was also the unattractive girl in high school in a school full of rich kids. Although everyone, including me, was the same in terms of financial stability, I couldn't relate a lot to their daily brunches at high end restaurants, chill family life (in that their parents seemed to let them do most of whatever they asked) and just overall feeling of uncomfortability. We treated each other nicely but that doesn't mean we can be friends. 

Eventually, puberty worked well for me (thankfully!) and now I look good enough for people to talk to, though my glasses hinder the overall look (hopefully will get contacts this year) and I have a slight belly but overall skinny-ish (skinny fat problems).

I have some very close friends but even then I would like to go out there and make more. 

Rushing has made me realise that I am someone who cannot be friends with just one type of person. I can be friends with the most popular people, the introverted and anyone in between. But the problem lies in being able to foster more relationships. I am also someone who loves a good party but also doesn't mind staying in my room once in a while. Last semester I stayed in my room a lot and it drove me crazy, especially since there are people around. That problem doesn't happen much when I go home because most of my friends left and being home is time to catch up with my parents. 

I also lack the willpower to do the things I want, such as work out and join more clubs. I need some advice that can help me go out there!

So, I dropped out and received a GED. I was going to apply to university but I was finding that my scores were so low that I'd be stupid to bother wasting the money for application fees etc... I live a few miles away from a community college in the ghetto and I was considering attending and transferring, but I think what is destroying me is where I live. I hate the memories of where I live and I'd never return for the rest of my life if I was able to leave. Having to be here for one more year is what I think is going to make me pass that point of no return, mentally.

It has now been 1.5 years since I dropped out. I don't want to do this shit anymore, sitting in my bedroom, making up fantasies and kidding myself, playing the guitar and saying I'm going to be famous once I vaguely get that ""aha!"" moment and break out of my shell.

I'm apparently good looking/handsome, charming, witty, intelligent... these have been my observations from what girls and guys tell me that I've talked to, and known. I really am to the point to where I don't know what to believe anymore, and that is what is scaring me. That is why I want to break free of this and finally attend university.

1674,unsureaboutmydegree,1422134685,/r/college/comments/2tjsrc/junior_almost_senior_student_looking_to_transfer/,"Hi everyone, so I'm currently a Biochemistry major at a small private school in California. I'm looking to transfer to a school that offers Chemical engineering. 

First, my grades:
 My grades started off bad but I started bringing them up (a lot of various external factors attributed to my low GPA. for one, I felt like I did not belong at my current university since I am a minority in a school 60% white affluent students, but that's another story.) I currently have a 2.33 (I was on academic probation for a semester because my semester GPA dropped to a 1.79, but the next semester i got a 2.69, which isn't the best but it was the highest GPA I've had in college and I was taking Upper division chem classes along with other physics and bio classes).  I know my GPA will limit me from transferring for sure.

I wasnt going to return to my university when I finished my first semester freshman year, but my parents encouraged me to do so. Even then I didn't want to return for sophomore year, but I rationalized that it woud be better to go and take classes that would probably be too difficult to get into at my local CC. Then my GPA dropped sophomore spring (i started rowing with hopes of possibly getting a scholarship and meeting people, boy i was wrong) to below a 2.0, so transferring was out of the picture.
So now I'm here, at a private school that I dont really like. People ask me how I like it and I was go ""well..... not really"". Why am I still here? Why did I think it would be a good idea to stay here?
 
Now my major:
I don't necessarily like biochemistry (proteins and such don't interest me) but my adviser insisted on me staying with biochemistry due to job prospects. I started doing research in a biochem lab but then switched into an organometallic/bioinorganic lab that focuses on catalysts. I wanted to take thermodynamics (pchem) but it is a class for chemistry majors. Although I am able to register for it, I will not be able to take the class that is the equivalent for biochem majors (which isn't really in my interest and my adviser is also against me taking it until i take a biochemistry class). A lot of the major classes are changing (so the class that was previously thermo will be changed to suit both chem and biochem majors.) Even if I did register for for thermo, I wouldnt be able to retake the class once it changed to satisfy my requirements for the biochemistry major. I really wont have a clue if I like thermodynamics or anythign related to chemical engineering. I feel like I would rather work as a Chemical Engineer in a plant rather than being a lab tech. I would talk to my adviser about this but she really just wants me to finish my degree and bounce. The thing is the job prospects for a BA (not even a BSc) in Biochemistry/chemistry are low and very competitive. I'm not sure what to anymore. 

Should I even consider transferring? I should also mention that by the time I graduate I will be around 40K in debt (i used to think it wasnt so bad since the starting salary for a biochem/chem major it USED to be 40K) . Or should I just suck it up and graduate? I could graduate with a BA in biochem and then do graduate school for Chemical Engineering but the thing goes back to my GPA and paying off my loans.

Any advice/comments/criticism would be greatly appreciated.",college,"Junior (almost Senior) student looking to transfer, but there are some setbacks....",http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2tjsrc/junior_almost_senior_student_looking_to_transfer/,1422152685.0

I have taken interest in majoring in CS, hopefully in one of the UC's, but was wondering if I even had a chance. I have been working extremely hard this past year and planned out all the courses I would need to take to be able to transfer.

No, I wasn't a party person, I was involved in quite a few activities, I did alright in most of my classes (kept a 3.0), worked a part time job, was in the honors program my first two years and graduated (always a plus). I speak Chinese, spent six years volunteering at the YMCA and SPCA (as well as a few others), have some leadership certifications and did five consecutive summers at a professional development program. Seems like it'll be resume material? Ehhh.

Nowadays, that's not quite enough. Well, it may be enough, but it's wrong. Seven months later, I can't get a single job; not part time, not full time, not even temp. I did it a bit wrong...a LOT wrong in retrospect, so I'll break down those few things listed and hope to possibly correct some of you or point you in the right direction. These seven months have definitely been a learning experience for me; unfortunately, I can't correct my mistakes now.



1) Get a job. Not the job I had, not working in dining hall or fast food. If you worked in fast food, your experience is in fast food. Push for either clerical work or at least be a server/cook. Restaurants laugh at my four years of experience because it wasn't ""traditional"" (even though I led some operations and trained incoming employees). They also don't like it if you have a BA and don't have legit serving experience. Several part time jobs have turned me away because I'm now overqualified and I'd ""soon quit"", causing them to lose money on employing me (BTW, the current figure in I/O Psych is that each employee costs $2,000 just in recruitment expenses. Never mind training and your salary, so keep that in mind as to why ""over-qualification"" exists). 



2) Don't quit your job. I didn't have much of a choice; my manager refused to work with my schedule and constantly scheduled me while I was in class. Hate your job? Don't quit. That gap in employment makes it seem like you can't handle a heavy workload. Seek something else (don't change too often!). Try to hold a job for at least 3 years at a time before changing (I've had several applications ask if I've held a single job for at least 3 years, especially those ones that allow you to go in without prior experience in said job). Always have something lined up before you quit.



3) Get involved....in the right activities. Your school's spirit team isn't going to get you far. I had toastmasters, cultural competency certifications, and pairing with international students to help them learn English. It's on my applications, and tends to be looked over. Make sure what you join will **help you meet the right people**.



4)**Meet the right people**. Connections are going to get you farther than your part time job or degree. Our local radio station's director dropped out of high school and is now making six figures because his parents happen to know the right people. Note: Other students who are on the right path towards success are a good start, but keep in mind that they'll be focusing on their own career upon graduation; try to get involved in activities where you may be coordinating with a company and meeting some of the higher ups, take every chance you get to go to meet and greets and possibly network. Your friends are your friends, you technically don't have to seek a certain group; employers prefer professional references to personal ones. Just make sure you create the opportunities to meet people who may bolster your resume: whether this means separating friends from activities or mixing them, that's up to you.



5) Intern, intern, intern. This is one of the best ways to make it into the market. I pushed this one downwards despite it's importance because if you're in the same situation I was, it's difficult to afford an unpaid internship; I had to work a part time job instead. Land a paid internship? Congrats! Take it! This is where you'll get experience that'll get you out of the restaurant/secretarial grind. Try for quite a few, even if they don't seem to be in your field. That recommendation may be what it takes.



6) Skip the volunteer work. Gahh, I hate putting this on here, because I'm a big proponent of volunteering, but it was a huge chunk of my time that became worthless upon graduation. Unless it's the place you want to work at, most companies seem to not count volunteer work as experience (even if you have clocked over a thousand hours of it -.- ). Out of (at least, I lost count afterwards) 200 applications, only three have allowed me to place volunteer work as experience, and even my 3 years of front desk experience tends to not be counted towards clerical jobs. Employers want to know you can be responsible and dependable; volunteer work leaves too much to the unknown: ""how could we know if they're timely if there aren't set times for them to show up?"", ""can they work a structured shift?"". It's easy to be a great volunteer; you're working for free.



7) Get in good with authority. Your professors, your boss, your supervisor at your volunteer location: they're future references. Hate your boss? Know your future employer is going to call him/her/ze one day. Look at the relationship as working towards something in the future, not for what it is presently. Oh, and keep in contact with your prior supervisors. If they move relocate to a new company and you can't hand over their phone number, you're a bit SOL on that experience counting for anything other than ""well, they weren't unemployed"".



8) Keep at least a 3.0 GPA. Hopefully there's enough said about that. Transcripts ARE asked for and looked at, and many applications ask ""did you have at least a 3.0""?



9) Learn the second most used language in your nation. For us in the USA, it's Spanish. Unless you'll be seeking work in the country of your second language outside of the one most used, it's not exactly useful on an application.

中文太无用了。烦死了。



10) Employers don't care about your personal situations. It's up to you to create your future.



So, outside of the norm ""prepare for interviews, know how to be professional, etc., etc."", these are the few tips I'll hand over to you that I've found as I've been job hunting. I don't mean to sound as though I'm bitching (though it is rather annoying), I just had blindly followed what was always taught to be the ""golden rules"" of gaining employment after graduation, and these seem to no longer have weight to them.

I dropped AP calc, not because I was bad at it, but because I simply didn't like it and thought ""I'll just take it in college.""

Currently, I just finished my second semester in college and I'm seriously considering switching out of engineering, but I'm not quite sure if I should do it. I'm a computer engineering major. First of all, I noticed that with little to no effort, I get 90+ grades in all of the liberal arts classes. I've always had a particularly good memory, so I just skim-read things on the way to class, and I can easily get a 90+. I'm also a very good writer, and I can whip out a full and exceptionally well-written essay without prior preparation and get 90+ on it. I struggle, however, in calculus and science classes. I look at the honor students in those classes as they discuss the topics in bewilderment. They just don't make sense to me. I'm not bad at them, but I just don't understand them. To pass my tests, I don't try to understand the concepts because that leads me nowhere. I simply memorize a bunch of stock problems and hope that's what I get on the test.

On one hand, if I switch out of engineering, I will be very happy to be doing something I actually enjoy. On the other hand, if I switch out of engineering, I'll be looked down at by my father, family, and relatives. My family is full of scholars.

I started college right out of high school (which was a mistake) with a full ride. I decided to double major in English and Anthropology. Somewhere down the line though, I just got lazy. I never had to study in high school and have always had things handed to me, finding myself somewhere I had to actually work was jarring for me and I got scared and just stopped trying. I'm very much so someone who refuses to ask for help and will just ignore the problem until it 'goes away'. I dropped out after 2 years and always figured I would go back but timing never seemed right. I think one of my main problems other than being spoiled as shit was that I simply didn't truly know what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.

Fast forward to 2013, I sort of stumbled on a job as a tutor in a kindergarten. I really had never had any interest in children or teaching, but it was a job. It was a complete surprise when not only was I good with the kids, but I LOVED going to work everyday. Here was someone thinking they hated kids and would rather die than teach actually considering going back to college for elementary education. The job also gave out 5k education grant, so at least some of my tuition would be covered. Later that year, my mother unexpectedly died. One of the last things we had talking about was me getting back in school and how she thought i would be an amazing teacher. Of course, I still put off reapplying. 

Fast forward AGAIN to Wednesday, I finally got my shit together and went down to campus and talked to admissions and advisers. After 2 days of meetings and running all over the place for paperwork I am enrolled again and start in January! I'm so excited but am also feeling a little overwhelmed at how fast it is happened. I had initially had the plan of finishing my English degree and start the education program after, but instead I'm just jumping into the program now. I'm really not even 100% percent sure what got me to finally go down there and talk to them, but I'm glad I did it.

I would like to know what you all think about this, and whether I am out of line to demand action in response to what occurred.

----

This past semester has been tough both academically and emotionally for me. In May, I was put on academic probation due to my grades. Because of this, I was clinically diagnosed with severe depression. After dealing with depression of that aftermath, I didn't do so hot this semester either. I struggled getting to class on time due to often forgetting materials for class (and having a class directly before). I am also in the process of getting tested for ADHD (which I would like assistance in finding treatment for), as I feel it is directly responsible for a lot of my grades in addition to a few other things...

For the past few weeks, I assumed I was doing fine in my classes as grades were not posted. I was completely unaware until this week when grades were posted, I was in jeopardy of being dropped by the school following academic probation. One class I know I will most likely have to retake, but a second would cause me to be dropped by (School) and sit out a semester. I was in jeopardy in two electives. I wish I could turn around time, but I cannot. Coming to grips with what happened, I set up an appointment with each professor to be followed with an appointment with my advisor to assess damage control. After talking to my first instructor who excused my absences due to family emergencies, was more than willing to sit down with me this week and discuss potential point opportunities. (XXXXX Teacher, bless her heart)

Following, I attended my second class (the other elective, XXX200), and following the last class of the semester (last day of class no final for this elective), I asked to speak privately with the professor. I calmly explained my situation, asking if there was anyway possible that I could have two excused absences. (the professors policy is -100 points each class after two absences, and the class is out of 1000; also using ""electronic devices"" is counted as a full absence"". At the beginning of the semester, I bought a tablet to use to take notes (ONLY). I was told it would be okay for use in class as long as I took only notes. 

Further, I missed two classes due to having due to visiting my dieing grandmother who is on her death bed dieing of lung cancer, and visiting her before each of her surgeries (she is the only relative I have left from that generation). Unfortunately, I did not report this officially as it wasn't in exact line with the University's grievance policy and further didn't think two absences would effect me. (This also caused me to miss being able to turn in a 100pt paper... further tanking my grade). After reviewing the syllabus, it said he would try to make adjustments in the case of a Family or Medical emergency (which it was), and all I was asking for was some kind of opportunity to receive enough credit to boost my grade enough to get a D- (enough to not be dropped by the University).

While calmly explaining this to my professor, he said one of the most hurtful things I have ever heard. He told me I was ""quite immature"" and not paying attention in class and on my tablet (when I was in fact taking notes and have them to prove). He further said and I quote: ""maybe you do not deserve a degree here at (University)"". I immediately turned around and left in tears. Never IN MY LIFE have I been so disgusted to trust my education to a faculty that takes my money and disrespects me in my face because of my learning style. I feel robbed, but yet I don't know if I can put total blame on him. Is he right to fail me due to the way I take notes and disregarding a life I have outside of my academics? For once in my life, I question whether I belong here as a (School Mascot). I feel this is in DIRECT violation of the Student Bill of Rights (Article XX). 

I plan on sending this incident report to multiple people with hopes of getting some kind of action regarding this. I have already sent it to our school president as well. Am I wrong?

1683,studentthrowaway1212,1418170103,/r/college/comments/2ot6n1/feeling_really_discouraged_with_college_advice/,"I'll try to keep this as short and concise as possible. I'm currently a sophomore at a big state school. Going here wasn't really a choice for me. In high school, I struggled a lot- I went to summer school every year and barely graduated. I REALLY didn't want to go to college. Yet still, my parents insisted I go, and so I ended up here. They're paying for all of it out of pocket, even though we're not rich. The ""college experience"" is very important to them. 

Yet I'm not really happy here. I'm marginally intelligent and like learning, but school does nothing but stress me out. Admittedly, I'm a terrible student- I procrastinate, turn things in late, miss assignments, and sometimes skip class. It's not because I don't care, it's because.. well I don't really know why. My first semester I did really well and got a 4.0. My second semester I did horrible. My GPA is now hovering somewhere near a 3.0, and this semester isn't looking too promising. 

I think a lot of the stress and discontent comes from the fact that I don't really know what I want to do with my life. I'm almost 20, and yet I don't know what I want to do for a career. My major is philosophy and religious studies, and while I'm very passionate about it, it's not very relevant in the job market. For a while I thought I wanted to go into academia, but I know now that I definitely don't want to do that. I'm starting to think that I'd be better off pursuing this as a hobby rather than a career. But I'm already almost halfway done with my degree, and honestly I can't think of anything else I'd want to switch to. 

I'm pretty disillusioned with my university, and society as a whole really. I feel like I'm surrounded by people who don't share my values, and I think that's where my apathy comes from. I don't want to stay, yet I don't want to leave either. Partly because my parents would be extremely disappointed (my older brother recently dropped out of college, and I would be their second child to do so), but partly because I've built a life for myself here. I've made friends and plans. Yet I feel like I'm wasting time and more importantly my parent's money. I'm just feeling really stuck and discouraged, and I'm wondering if anyone has been in the same boat.

TLDR: I'm feeling increasingly disillusioned and apathetic about my college experience. Not sure about my major or what I want to do with my life. Advice?

I tried going to college when I was younger, but due to my depression ended up dropping out twice. I have since gotten my depression under control, but now that I look back at my transcripts, I don't know what sort of schools I ought to apply to give my record.

I started my college career by going to a community college. It started off well with a perfect GPA in my first year or 2, but eventually my depression kicked back in and my grades fell. I went from about to be accepted as a transfer student to an Ivy League university to seemingly having no business applying to a top 30 school at all. I graduated from the community college with a 3.4 total GPA and a 2. something science GPA which include 2 Fs, 2 repeated classes where I got Cs both times and 2 or 3 Ws. Still persisting, I went to a state school where I accomplished nothing, but ruin my academic record further. I enrolled in that school twice in the Fall of 2 separate years and each Fall walked away with nothing, but a transcript full of Ws. The first time, I took 4 classes and the second I took 5 for a total of 9 Ws from the state school. The only upside is that I have an associates in general science and no debt.

The above occurred within 7 years which is about when I graduated from high school till now. In between starting the community college and graduating high school I did nothing, but lay in bed for 2 years. I took 3 years to graduate from the community college and I dropped out of the state school twice near the end of the Fall semester each time. I did nothing that I could put on a resume during those 2 years either and have been doing nothing resume worthy since. It's only in the recent months that I have gotten control of my depression and feel ready to move on with my life. I mention this primarily to say that I have nothing to show for the time off I took, nothing to boost my chances of getting in some places.

Given my record, it doesn't seem I could get into any good programs whether they be to complete my undergraduate education or graduate school.

It was great, with my pell grant and scholarship my parents are only having to pay ~$500 a semester out of pocket.

Things weren't going so hot the first couple of weeks. I felt really alone because I had a hard time making friends and I was pretty sure I didn't like my major. I went home every weekend and one time I cried as I drove back to school because I didn't want to go back because I was so miserable.

Things started looking up about a month in, I made some friends, I changed my major to something I love, and I started going home every other weekend instead of every weekend. It was fine up until about 2 weeks ago.

I'm only taking 12 hours so I don't really feel overwhelmed by the work load. I'm not homesick either, or at least I don't feel like I am. I do hate living in the dorms.

I got accepted to Clark University, Umass Amherst, Uconn, and Worcester state U. In my infinite wisdom, I decided to pick the cheapest school (Worcester state) because I didn't want the financial burden of student loans. I was going there for nearly free as a commuter, on institutional scholarships and the Adams scholarship. Fast forward a year, and I dropped out. It was a dismal little degree mill with bored professors, no resources, no classes to choose from, a deaf administration, no food, no parking, nothing good to speak of. For the two semesters I was there, I got a 3.8 (semester 1) and (I think) a 3.2 or 3.0 in semester 2.

I dropped out in a huff at the start of the semester this year after having to pay $30 a day in parking tickets because the administration made it impossible for commuters to park anywhere. I want to apply to Umass Amherst, which is fairly competitive for a state school. I just don't know how to apply - do I apply as a transfer student? Do I apply as a freshman again, and lose my credits but go in with a shinier record? I had 21 AP credits accepted at Worcester State, Plus the 24 credits I took while I was there. I don't know what my chances are as a transfer student, but I feel like they're pretty low if my GPA dropped .8 between two semesters. I was in the honors program at WSU if that's worth anything.

As for the debt thing - my dad was taking a gap year when I went into WSU (One of the main reasons I chose that school), and now he's back at work and making enough that Umass's tuition is going to be no problem. I just need to know what my options are - Did I blow it in the second semester and kill my chances of going to Umass? Should I re-apply to worcester state?

I am originally from Texas, moved to Oklahoma for school, dropped out of the first university, then moved to another university in the same state.

I found myself becoming more, and more depressed at my current school. My parents gave me the idea of coming back home to Texas, but attend a university an hour from home. I originally wanted to move as far away from home as I could at 18. Now at 21, I think the idea of being closer to home isn't so bad. I'm just worried that what if this isn't a good idea? What if I can't make friends? What if I just end up feeling the way I did before?

Now the difference between the school I will be transferring to next semester from the others is that I actually have friends from high school attending the school, so there's a start. I just really don't know how to start over, I guess. I'm leaving behind a couple of people, a boy I started to like, but I'm also leaving behind the memories from this school that have caused severe depression, and anxiety.

1697,[deleted],1410657455,/r/college/comments/2gc2hx/university_is_uni_for_me/,"Hello Reddit, 

I am a 20 year old student at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. I began my degree in political science in the Fall of 2013. I struggled but managed a 3.07/4 GPA. However, at the start of the Winter semester, because of personal and academic struggles, I decided to call it quits. I dropped out and spent the next 3 months working at my corner store job I had been at for 2 years. I don't have many hobbies, so I mostly read, spent time at home and played video games. I did go to the gym for a bit, but I gave up. I had also been struggling with feeling for my best friend, who is the very reason I enrolled at that specific university in the first place. It is a very good school and was no means a bad decision, but maybe the pretext to go wasn't good. Basically she didn't like me back and a lot of it went to shit. I did see my friends sometimes during that time off, but they were very busy with school so I was kind of lonely. I was considering changing my major to journalism (a program not offered at McGill) and so I applied to other unis. However, after talking to a journalist I had the opportunity to question, I found out that it was great, if not better, to have a more knowledge-based degree (like Poli Sci) and form a good journalistic portfolio by writing for student papers instead of having a journalism degree. I also thought to myself that I loved politics, a subject that interests me. 

I thus made the decision to take two summer courses at the McGill and try to do as best as I could. Wouldn't you know it: I got two A's, one in Microeconomics and the other in a Classics course. Furthermore, during that summer, I suddenly found myself loving the gym and, encouraged by some of my good friends who like to work out, started going very consistently. I also got over my girl problems.  I felt very confident and was very willing to give a full semester another shot. So, earlier this month, I began my Fall 2014 semester. To fully dedicate myself to school, I quit my job (didn't need it much since I live with my parents and don't have any bills/debts, plus I saved up more than enough).

Which leads us to my problem: I don't think I am made for this. The thing is, I love going to lectures, listening to my profs and learning from them. I am not shy to ask questions and am a very curious person. I also love university life: being involved in clubs, meeting new people, hanging out after school, etc. However, the thing that puts me off is the amount of reading that there is to do. Honestly, I love to read. Reading novels, biographies, etc. is something that I enjoy. However, it's a different story for academic reading. I can't simply sit back, have the book open and read it like I would the latest Dan Brown novel. In university, you are expected to annotate, highlight, take notes and all that, something I am very bad at.Maybe it's my major, who knows? I like politics, I keep myself informed and I have opinions, but readings in university just turn me off. I especially don't know what I am supposed to take away from the 3-5+ articles every prof assigns for every lecture (2-3 lectures a week) and remember all that information in 3 months when finals are upon us. Am I expected to highlight/annotate/take notes from every single reading the prof puts on the syllabus?  I really want to succeed and I really am willing to try. In the Fall semester, I did manage to study and do passably good. I am sure I could do it again this semester, but I feel anxious about not performing as well as I want to.

I know all university programs are hard and that it is a big commitment. I see it two ways: I am simply in the wrong field (I love politics, but hate political science?) or I am not made for university and should do something else with my life. 

So Reddit, got any advice to share? I could really use some.",college,[University] Is uni for me?,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2gc2hx/university_is_uni_for_me/,1410675455.0

**Academics**


When I applied to schools as a HS Senior, I knew my passions, but didn't know what I wanted to do with them. I applied to music schools around Michigan and got accepted to Central Michigan. I studied voice my freshman year, and I did great with a 2.96 GPA. I felt it wasn't right though. Sophomore year I began to look into studying business, and music production. My GPA at the end was 2.4, not great but respectable. My third year I felt music wasn't right, tried art/photography. Besides for my depression which I'll get to, this was the worst I've done. 1.6 GPA. I dropped from school and came back to live with mom and dad to figure out what to do next. 

**Personal**

*This might seem irrelevant, but it's not.*

Going into my Freshman year at CMU I considered myself a crossdresser. I was okay with that then. As the year went on I more or less ignored it, and stuck to the gender stereotype. Doing this began to spin me into a mild depression, but it was something I could handle. My sophomore year, my depression worsened, I came out to my roommate and asked to be more open about it, he said yea. I learned a lot about myself that year, and began to consider myself genderfluid, by the end of the year I started to feel gender dysphoria and with it a higher sense of depression. My third year my depression and dysphoria took me big time, my GPA reflects that. I spun into the worst depression of my life, trying my best to maintain a normal life. I couldn't do it, drank a lot, partied hard. By the end of my 3rd year I started to think I was transgender. Going home, I put myself into therapy. Talking to her and being able to find myself, I saw something I hadn't seen before. My passion for helping people and their gender identity. Because of this, I think I found what I want to study, gender, women, and sexual studies, a psychology degree perhaps?

**Extracurricular**

My freshman year I really didn't do much. It was hard for me to find a club I really fit into, so I tried to sing in as many choirs as I could, tried Barbershop, Jazz, Chamber. My sophomore year I found photoclub, joined that and felt it was a great fit for me. I continued singing in the vocal jazz group. The third year I took on presidency of photoclub and also joined a music recording club as there visual media member. The jazz group disbanded due to lack of interest.  

**Conclusion**

I'm looking at schools in Washington State as it's my dream to live in Seattle on day. *I'm not looking for sympathy or help about my personal life. I'd like help trying to figure how to write an essay merged around those three points.* Because I have such a low gpa, I feel I need to really speak highly of my Photo Club presidency status, and then correlate the transgender issues to the low GPA. I will also talk about what I can bring to the school in terms of LGBTQ issues and starting a photoclub if they do not have one yet.

Thank you for your help.

1702,kingtrashmouth,1403472393,/r/college/comments/28tjzc/broke_27_yo_dropout_with_plan_on_becoming_a/,"Hello everyone,

Id like to tell you a little bit about myself and my goals, and then ask a few questions about some issues that I am a bit confused about.  If any of my questions are redundant or have been discusses before, I apologize.  Ive done some research over the last few days, but Ive been out of the college loop for a looong time, and a lot of what I found basically just confused me.  While I appreciate any and all advice/suggestions, Im particularly looking for the advice and opinions of those who have experience with the admission process of non-traditional students, either from the admitting side or from the administration side.


**About Me**:

I attended a very small high school (25-30 kids in my graduating class).  I was a very bright student, but was very irresponsible with my studies (and Id like to kick past me in the head for that now).  Between practically not even trying in classes that I found boring or unchallenging and genuinely trying and not always doing well in more difficult classes, I graduated with an overall GPA that hardly touched a 2.0 (Also no weighted grades in my HS, though I took several honors classes)

I enrolled in a local technical college after my senior year.  I was not involved much in the enrollment process though, as my parents insisted on doing the paperwork for me, so I have little to no experience or memory of the actual enrollment process.  My approach to college at the time was nearly identical to my approach to high school, which meant that I got my ass handed to me in most of my classes -- with the exception of world history I &amp; II, which I consistently scored among the highest on every test.  I realize now that it was only because I found the content and the professor terribly captivating.

Anyway, after two semesters, I was doing a terrible, terrible job at being a college student.  I was living with my parents in a small town that most of my friends had used college as an excuse to get the hell out of.  I worked full time fast food to help pay for college without accruing debt (through some program that my parents had set up, Im unsure about what it was, but fortunately I never had any debt to pay after college).  I spent my freshman year of college emotionally frustrated, alone, and mostly depressed.  I eventually stopped going to most of my classes, failed a lot of them, and then at the end of the year when I got the letter telling me that I was on probation, I straight up dropped out.  I flipped my small town and lame-ass technical college the bird and moved as far away as I could (which wasnt terribly far, by the way, but good enough for teenage me).

I eventually moved back after a while in order to get a good paying job (""Ha, who needs college when Im making money like this"" - Me, circa 2007).  Since then Ive held several jobs, had my ups and downs, and life has happened.  Im currently in a settled long term relationship of five years (we will probably start the ""getting married"" process in a year or two) and supporting two kids.  The economy in my area is shit, and with no formal training or education my options are severely limited.  Im tired of working terrible jobs.  I am ready to go back to school.

This brings us to now.  I plan to go into teaching (english/history/social studies, not sure which yet), as that is a profession that I feel I could excel in, and one that would bring me a lot of satisfaction.  Also, teachers are always in need in my state, so I feel like I would have a fair amount of job security that allowed me to use my education.  I have done some research on what I need to do to become a teacher.  I plan to attend a community college for my first two years, to raise my GPA, then applying to one of several colleges near me that offer the major that I need.  Much of what I am confused about is financial things, requisites, and the timing in which all of this school stuff is supposed to happen.  This is why I come to you, dear redditors.  My questions are:

* 1. I am dirt poor with terrible credit.  In my current situation, there is no way I can pay out of pocket for anything.  I know about the existence of FAFSA and filled one out one a few years ago, but are there other agencies that I should check out, particularly ones intended for non-traditional students?
* 2. FAFSA distributes aid on a first-come basis (or thats what my HS counselor told me), so would it be worth it even to apply for aid for fall 2014 semester at this point (nearly July), or should I wait until next year?  
* 3. If I wait until next year, would I be able to enroll for a spring 2015 semester, given that I would have to wait until I received my W-2 (usually get it end of january) or should I just wait until fall 2015?  If I wait for the spring semester, would I be able to enroll before being cleared for any aid without being required to pay any large sums up front?
* 4.  I expect my total income for 2014 to be very close to the same amount as it was 2013.  With this information, is there anyway to fill out a fafsa before receiving a W-2 or filing taxes for 2014 in order to receive the maximum amount of aid available to me?
* 5.  I took the ACT (the preferred pre-enrollment test in my area) after graduation, and scored well on it.  As an adult student 9 years out of HS applying to a community college, am I required to take the test again?

I recently lost my job, and my ex-boyfriend kicked me out, leaving me to take up temporary residency on my friend's couch. I haven't been able to find a job and am currently penniless, so I've applied to school. 

My parents are both poor, divorced, and don't support me aside from paying $10 a month to keep my phone on. Because of this, instead of using my mother's information (who lives in the same state as I do) I put that I was homeless. However, when I went to the financial office at the school and tried to explain my situation (I even went as far as to bring them notarized letters from the friends I'm now living with), they acted like they didn't need anything from me. They told me that the school had to process the information, but told me that I could sign up for classes, which doesn't make sense to me. I've always heard that the fafsa must be completed before you do that. The guy also said that I should take the notarized letters to the records office which, again, did not make sense to me. They made copies, sent me on my way, etc.

1712,PerplexedLifeStudent,1395294090,/r/college/comments/20vr5z/how_does_reddit_balance_life_and_college_as_well/,"Hello reddit,

I am seriously stuck in my life. Life for me sucked until the day I got myself a job and got myself into college. When I started college, I was taking 5 classes all on two days of the week. I would spend a total of 13 hours at school. Doing homework and studying was no problem especially with two 1hour breaks in between. I was getting A's and B's without even trying. The first year went perfect. Except in the second semester with one failed math class. This was also the semester I started chasing a girl. Literally chasing. Like I ran after her. I was in pursuit. Any who, I eventually got her and made her mine. With me being in college and having my first girlfriend, I decided to get a ""better"" job. Ended up being a third shift department supervisor at a factory for crap pay. This job almost killed me my third week in, due to second shift screwing up some machines. I lost my first summer with my first girlfriend. I was high on vicodin and an annoying jerk. After two and a half months I went back to that job as well as starting back up in my third semester of college. Because I was working full time, I took only two classes. This pretty much started my downward spiral. I passed both classes, one of which was the failed math course from the semester prior, and I quit the job that was becoming too dangerous. During this time, my sister moves out with some chick she knew for three months as soon as she turned 18. Fights with the lady friend are also becoming more frequent. The stupid things a recent deflowered man worries and cries about to the girl he loves about her past. I was a bitch. I still am. So now we move onto the fourth semester. Girlfriend took a math class I need for my degree with me. I was taking three classes and had no job. I failed all three and almost broke up with her. More of the stupid ""her past that made me sad"" bull. Summer came and I got a job. Then the fifth semester came rolling around and my dumb self only gets one class. The math class I failed. I ended up passing it, but broke up with the girlfriend because of me not getting the appreciation I deserved from her or her family. Sixth semester is here and I find out I am losing my job. Also, I am taking three classes. During this time I get back with my ex after two months. Parents on the verge of divorce. Life flipping. I have already dropped one class about to drop another. Girlfriend already in a university I should have been in a year ago. Feeling a hell of a lot of emasculation. Just stuck.

With all this in my head, I do not act as though I am a victim. I am just wondering why I do not have that motivation I had when I started college. Why is it so hard for me to do well in a freaking cc?!

World Geography: D+ 6. Physical Education: C 7. Algebra 1: C- *Semester 2: 1. Spanish: B+ 2. Graphic Design 1: D 3. English: F 4. Health: C 5. P.E.: C 6.

So maybe having four years of being in the art academy would help me out on my college resume?? *I was a peer counselor, but hated it, so I dropped. So that won't be something I can put on my resume. These are my plans for the next two years to turn things around (hopefully): *Second Semester Sophomore Year: -straight A's -1 AP class *Junior Year: -I'll be taking AP Chemistry, AP English, AP US History, Honors Algebra 2/Trigonometry, Graphic Design 3 (which is a college-credit class), &amp; then I have two electives- which I'm still deciding if taking a third year of Spanish is worth it in terms of helping me out in college admissions. However, I think I'll be retaking General Science in the first semester, &amp; Algebra 1 in the second semester. But if I have the credits for graduation (a D gives you graduation credit)- would I still get college credit too in the state of California? I guess what I'm saying is, would the grade I get when I retake the class override the old grade? *Senior Year: -I'll be taking AP English, AP Physics, AP Government, AP Statistics, Economics for a semester &amp; then retaking World Geography the next semester, &amp; then one more elective. 

*I also plan on taking a math class over the summer online through the community college, to get ahead in my math requirement. *And this is the big deal- I can't do any kind of extracurriculars. I'm not going to get into it, but I've basically got a home situation that makes it impossible to do extracurriculars or sports or anything like that, let alone to be able to study. But I do what I can and now am staying up until at the minimum Midnight every night so I can get all A's. I also am trying desperately to get a job, but even that is going to be hard to manage with my home situation. *I'll admit I was lazy freshman year, but I was experiencing really bad depression as a result of...well yeah, this probably isn't the thread to get into it. I've been told by many teachers that I have a ""raw talent"" for writing, so maybe I could knock the admissions essay out of the ball park and it would help me? *I don't want to go to community college at first, because then I'll most likely have to stay with my parents. I really, really want to go to a UC, but don't think that's possible. But I'd be fine going to a state college too. Is there any hope for me? P.S. I absolutely love astrophysics, I self-study and I think it's what I want to do with the rest of my life, but if I don't go into astrophysics, then I plan to go into software engineering or something related to that. Perhaps animation, something I also love but need to improve on majorly. Sorry this was so long, thank you for reading! I'm desperate.

I really feel like I need to get back into college. a little backstory:
     I am 20 years old and a dropout. I went to a community college near where I live and for the 2 years that I went there I kind of slacked off and didn't really put school as a top priority. I guess the reason for this is because I really didn't know what to major in and what to pursue and some family personal problems dint help. Anyways I was able to get a grant for the first two years to pay for classes and since my GPA was so low they refused to pay for a third. I was dating someone and we were planning to move in together so I dropped out of college and quit my job to move in with her out of state and pursue a community college up there and plans fell through and we arent together anymore so I am basically stuck with no job and no schooling.
    I really want to pursue computer science as a major and I feel like if I move out of state into a four year university and I wasnt living at home where my family wasn't hounding me about finding a job and doing well in school and I was surrounded by other college-goers will motivate me to doing well. I feel like I can focus on school in that situation.

     I guess what I'm asking is if this is a good idea to do and how I would go about starting to leave to go to university and maybe which one would be good for a computer science major. I was thinking about moving to Colorado but that's just a blind guess. My GPA in high school was around a 3 and in college it was like a 2.0 if that helps.

I have over 100 completed semester units, 3.5 GPA. I was supposed to be a biology transfer student, but I am unable to get the classes I need and I was given shitty advice from my school counselors. I was told by multiple counselors that general education was the priority. At the time I didn't question it, because I didn't know better and couldn't get into the classes for my major anyway due to being a newer student. When I'd ask for advice from the counselors they would tell me to keep taking gen ed and ""filler classes"" to get bumped up the registration priority list, so I could get into the classes I needed. The problem is that by following this plan I bumped over 90 units, which immediately dropped me to the bottom of the list for registration, and now there is no way in hell I'm ever going to get those classes. For example organic chemistry is offered once a year, and has only 34 positions. It fills up on generally the first day, or at least within the first 3 days, and my registration day is now falling 2-3 weeks after the start of registration. I went and explained everything to another counselor last semester and desperately begged for *any* kind of advice to at least start moving forward in some direction, and she just spit out the exact same thing they all say. Every appointment is a printouts from assigst.org, 20 minutes of the counselor talking about themselves, and it ends with""*Just keep trying, you'll get in eventually*"" I just burst into tears after my appointment, because I feel like I can't go to university anymore and I just wasted years and lots of money. This past year in particular had me so depressed I developed an eating disorder. I feel so lost and have no idea what to do.


Are there people I can talk to for advice and guidance to get through this without costing a fortune? I just don't want all these years and the things I gave up to go to school to be worth nothing.

 * 1) That I'll be too afraid to actually commit and I'll keep putting it off semester by semester. 
 * 2) That I won't be able to afford it.  I can't quit my job -- obviously -- since I have people depending on my paycheck to help pay a chunk of the household utilitles.  I have some government loans already from the first 4 years of school (which have gone into repayment)

Basically, right after high school I went to college and slacked off/partied too much. After my second year, I dropped out but recently I've inherited enough money to pay off my loans and go to school again. I couldn't be more thankful of this second opportunity I've been given.

Architecture has really interested me. It seems like a highly rewarding career and hey, the pay is really nice too. But I'm scared out of my mind.

When I sit down to do programming for class I feel like I could be getting paid for it. Not mention, the stuff I'm doing in my internship is much more interesting than the projects or homeworks. I graduate in 1 month anyway, if Reddit doesn't prevent me. Double major in math. It's been a rough 4 years to say the least. I got into some trouble freshman year and got kicked out of my dorm/school, quickly transferred right after the incident to a better school and dominated my sophomore and junior years. School was cake. Now, however, I'm plagued by even the thought of getting started and I wait til the last minute to start. I'm producing crap but still passing ±0.25 of the std. dev. so I'm not too worried, just tired of school. Honestly, at times, I feel embarrassed to be doing so well and trying so little. 

I've gotten some full-time offers but have yet to accept anything. Some offers are too far but pay well (80k) while others are close and pay average (60k). I want a lot of stuff so naturally the more the better. Living at home could save me ~12-16k/year but what fun is that. However, in terms for student loan debt, from what I estimate, I have more than the average student ~$46.5k but I've already paid ~$8.5k so I really have ~$38k left. I received tons of need/merit based aid too, went to public school, and took 4 AP courses in high school. It's retarded expensive to go to college, even if you do everything right like me ;)

Car has been having problems recently and I just found out I need to pay another 2k for the Fall semester since I dropped a class because of laziness and bc I didn't need it for anything, just an elective to reach full-time (12 credits). I lost a 2k scholarship that was already credited to my account since I dropped to 9 credits. Bullshit is that shit. Pretty mad about dat doe.

Thinking about buying a GTI too. Wicked awesome little cars. Have yet to test drive one but looking forward. That, or a 2013 audi/bmw Just can't wait til school is over and I get started at my job, save vigorously a few months (12-24), pay off all my loans &amp; get a nice ride to replace the POS granny-mobile 02 toyota solara I've been rocking the past ~4 years. Hopefully a nice car will impress easy-to-get girls. If not, I can still appreciate the german engineering....

I graduated high school with a fairly decent GPA, got into a private religious university, and was doing well for my first year. While I was still at school, I decided I wanted to go back home and take online classes so I can help take care of my Grandma who was very sick. I ended up going home after that semester and had a week of Spring Break off before the next one began. 

The exact day the semester started, my home burned down in an electrical fire. I had gotten a lot of the introduction assignments done, but I started to fall behind as time passed, having to help contact contractors and our insurance company along with the emotional toll of losing close to everything we had. I e-mailed my professors telling them what was going on and apologized for my assignments being turned in late since I had so much to deal with. Being a private college, they weren't sympathetic and told me the rules applied to everyone. Long story short, I ended up failing all 5 classes I took online that semester. I tried calling counselors, talked to literally 5 different ones, and they all said they couldn't help me. They didn't tell me when the deadline was I could drop the classes with a W. My GPA is extremely low now, around 1. something. I'm retaking 3 of the classes, which will replace those grades.

At the moment, I'm still home and am now going to a community college and retaking those classes online so I can be here with my family. I didn't want to leave them to deal with all of this. I eventually want to transfer, but I feel as though my GPA won't be good enough for any university. I have no plans to go back to my original school. Even while I was there, I was planning to transfer. Should I explain what happened in my personal statements? Do you think I can recover from what happened?

I started at a 2 year school to save money on tuition, but also to get my feet under me after a few years out of school.  I was told at the start of my first semester (summer) I would be eligible for HOPE/Zell after 30 credit hours, and that they had to be in-state credit hours.  The FA counselor pushed me staying at the 2 year to finish those 30, then move on if I wasn't going to get my associates.  FYI, at the time I could find no info anywhere that talked about out of state credits related to HOPE.

This morning, I learned that none of that was correct.  Those old credits do count towards my HOPE GPA, and I could have been at my chosen university on small loans (~$3000 a semester) instead of stuck in a backwater, terrible college I hated.  I could have transferred out at the end of that semester.

This same college lost my transcript twice while mailing it, dropped my classes in the middle of a semester and then made me beg all my teachers to be let back in (""clerical error"") and routinely screwed other students over in a multitude of ways.  I had a 3.6 at the end of 35 hours at that school, and nearly didn't get in to my other college due to their mishandling paperwork.  They also won't release a copy of my shot records to me.  They have the original.  (long story)

HOPE covers 80% of tuition and no fees, requires a 3.0.  Zell covers 100% of tuition, has a fees stipend, and requires a 3.3.  I just found out that I am not getting a full ride, basically.

Is there any way in the University System of Georgia for a student (or group of students) to file a formal complaint with the USG about a school's behavior?  I have physical evidence, and teachers that have since left that may be willing to go to bat for us.  This is not the first time this has happened to a student here, and several of us are fed up with it.  I'm not even a current student anymore.  It's just a pattern of behavior I would expect more from a for-profit college.

Though, I'm having a dilemma that I brought up in my last posts before. About 2 or 3 weeks ago I went back to the Community College to change my Spanish class because it felt like a waste of time for me since I'm fluent in Spanish. So I looked up classes that I was interested in mostly sciences and technology classes but they were either filled or only available late in the afternoon. I thought about Criminology and found Intro to Criminology and there were spots open so I went with it. I switched to that class and just bought the required book yesterday for a high amount at the school bookstore with Financial Aid. Now that it's the day before and it's my first class tomorrow I'm having second thoughts on the class. Criminology does interest me but then again I cant see myself actually being in that field let alone doing well in it. So what I'm asking is, can anybody who has taken this kind of class or is possibly in this field tell me a little bit about it to calm myself? I was going to see how the class goes, see if I like it or not, and if I don't I was going to try and search up classes again and see if anyone dropped out and try to switch but then it would be a hassle to catch up on the first day since idk what is going to happen the first day in any of my classes.

I'm a twenty-one year old, living at home with a low paying job at a department store. I've got two full semesters at my local community college (~29 credit hours) done, but I've reached a standstill.

I started off badly by being a jackass my senior year of high school and doing almost no work, so that screwed me a bit. Scored a 32 composite on the ACT, 1390 SAT, and perfect scores on all of my statewide comprehensives, save math. Test scores were never an issue for me, nor was the material; I was just a lazy prick. Hindsight is 20/20, blah blah.

Regardless of the shit-stained final quarter of my high school career,  went to community college. Not in any of my classes did I receive anything lower than A's, until I began to follow the same lazy, apathetic tendencies that plagued my senior-year-self. I failed three classes due to attendance, and just stopped going.

Keep in mind, this tuition came out of my own pocket, with help from my dad. I received no financial aid due to my awful transcripts.

Wasted money doing that, and blew the rest of my meager salary on pot and comic books. Now I'm stuck with even worse hours (dropped to MAYBE 20 a week), with my car insurance constantly looming and an unpaid traffic ticket haunting my every financial decision. My family has thus far move away, and I'm stuck in my home town living with friends until I can save enough money to somehow return to college, at least first to community and hopefully move in to a university soon after.

The problem here is, there are no jobs anywhere near where I live, and my student loans require a co-signer due to my lack of credit, which my parents refuse to sign (though I can't blame them, times are tough). 

I really do feel strongly motivated to better myself and return to school, and it's really aching to have a lack of any sort of studying or schoolwork in my life. I've grown up a bit too late, and now I have no idea where to go from here.

* basic English

* an ""introductory"" slash study prep (aka social free time class where we just goofed off)

* A Drawing class. 

I got nothing but Bs in all of them.

My art class was the class that took the last straw for me. In my art class my teacher was pregnant to begin with.  She was due soon and did have her child during our semester. We got another teacher to replace her who was much less forgiving in work. After the 9 or so weeks the original teacher came back and joined the substitute  teacher for final grading.

She is back for this one day to judge the work in our portfolio that we filled during the semester (during her absence). She was barely there long enough to ""know"" our work but I felt she did have a slight idea as to who were committed and who were not.. I don't know that is what I felt anyway.

Regardless, I do not think it is fair for a teacher who is barely there to be able to grade our entire portfolio in one day and have it be our final grade.  She doesn't know the context of the work environment, the students or even anything really. I ended up getting another B for whatever reason. I was one of the 10 (out of nearly 30) that stuck all the way through and barely missed a class.  Some of these assignments required us to actually go to SEVERAL locations and draw what we saw. Some students got to do the work at home opposed to in class.. etc 

Like I said at this school I am getting nothing but Bs. I've had issues here before and filing complaints get you know where.  It was never for anything academic though. 

Is this common in college? Is it common to get teachers who leave and come back like that? Is it common to get all Bs in one semester? It just seems fishy to me and I will be transferring but I just don't want to get my hopes up again in hopes of change if t his is actually common.

I busted my ass working hard and getting good grades for my first two years, my lightest term so far was more credits than some people take in their heaviest terms, and I'm working two jobs as well because I really want to get out of here without a whole lot of debt. 


I've been doing a ridiculous amount of school and work, and I've also been leading two student groups, but up until now I've somehow had the motivation and enthusiasm to be able to pull it all off. But over the past couple of weeks, I've started to think about things and realize how phenomenally stupid the entire situation is. I'm constantly running around doing things for other people, because I tend to base my self-worth on others' opinions of me, and I'd hate myself for letting everyone down if I quit any of the jobs or clubs. 


The main thing I used to motivate myself to do well in my first two years of boring prerequisite courses was the promise of interesting, technical courses for my final two years, and an interesting job after that. But now that I'm finally in those ""interesting"" courses and have a job very similar to what I'll probably end up in for my career, I've found out that the stupid boring classes are a much better representation of how a job in this field will be, and the ""interesting"" classes are crippled by the lowest common denominator of my unintelligent peers, to the point where I learn far more by ignoring the professor completely and reading Reddit and Hacker News. 


Now my grades are starting to suffer, because I'm not putting in the time that the professors seem to want me to, and I'm preoccupied with the idea of finding some way out. I don't know if they'd let me back if I took a gap year, and I'll have no time for vacation this summer because I have a really ""good"" internship, which I'm afraid is only going to cement my negative opinions of my field more thoroughly. I've gotten enough scholarships through the years that I could combine my internship salary and savings and pay off what few loans I have if I dropped out of college after this term, but I have no idea what I'd do then.

It seems the process of getting a required book that I paid for mailed to me is too hard for the school to handle. Apparently, much harder than taking 2.2k or whatever and signing me up for the class. Never issues or a problem doing that. Maybe its not hard so much as its that once you have someone's tuition you just don't care. 

I have been out of state for 2 years now and this is the first time I have had so much trouble getting books that I am charged for sent to me. It is really telling how good the school is at getting you through the financial aid process and collecting their money but when it comes time to have the things you need to do your work they can't take the moment to drop a book in the mail. 

A couple of quarters ago (when I had two deaths in my family) I requested to drop a class due to stress and travel this event caused. Kathy said it was fine but she was still sticking it to me for 2.2k even though I had never once dropped a class or had attendance issues, and I was within the drop out period. She even had the audacity to ask me for a credit card number during that very phone call. 

I am going to air all of this out and vet the administration of the school. I am going to post reviews and blog about it. I will tell my facebook friends. Academy College re-enforces why government subsidization is terrible for college and I will tell everyone I know to avoid your school. I won't be the first one to hammer Academy on the internet and I surely won't be the last if you don't change your dismal policies. 

If you are going to allow a student to study remotely, maybe you should take the time to ensure he or she is going to have the things that you are charging them money for so that they can take the class and obtain the materials they are paying for. 

I hope that these government subsidies end for colleges soon so that they actually have to compete for a student's business rather than just going through the motions taking monies and placing all responsibility on the student to harass the administration to get a simple book mailed.

For the most part I am parallel to my friends who stayed in school though, like there isn't an 11 year gap or anything I think I am off by 1 or 2 years in graduating.

**speaking to my adviser**
I never spoke to my adviser until recently and I am clueless about how this all works. I am not apart of a family that has had people in college but we aren't exactly bad off either especially in this economy. So speaking to her, IMO, was like talking to a wall. She was the one asking *me* the questions. Is this how it is supposed to be? 

It started off with ""Well what classes are you taking?"".. this is after I gave her my student ID and info. It was right there on her screen which makes me think it was her but then later it just kept going. I have no idea how this is supposed to work. I know it is kinda stupid being in college and not having any real goals or knowledge on how it works but isn't it her job to help me out a bit? I came from the GED program so all I have is what I see on TV or YouTube to go by. I have no idea what it is like being this or that. I can only go by what I see so I was expecting her to suggest different classes for me to get experience or even some tips? Is that not how that is supposed to work? Is it supposed to be sort of personal or am I just another student that she has to see on just another day? IDK.. So she never felt like a real adviser to me. 

I've seen YouTube videos of people who have gone abroad or work at huge corporations like Microsoft through partnerships all setup through their advisers and yet mines could not even be bothered to read my history on her monitor. This is not even including other issues I've had with her.. like I was LUCKY to meet with her when I did due to her taking time off and never responding to emails. It's moments like this that just question my ability especially as a GED recipient.

**what I want to do**
When it is all said and done I know I want to be a research scientist I am just not sure in what field because it all is interesting to me. I am taking my basic maths and sciences now. I have read this this should be my focus in community college opposed to a major. As for what I want to major in I bounce around a lot between specific select careers. Astronomy, Geology, and technology.

As far as astronomy I like [planetary geology](http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/nea.php). Geology I think I like the weather or climate system. Computers is a lot more confusing though. I like the hardware side of things, I know that. I reeeeally am into things like [virtual worlds](http://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality) which also may be software at times but overall I like knowing how computers work in terms of respect. Like the motherboard is dead sheet metal until you press the power button and it all instantly comes to life, sorta amazing to me anyway. I have been thinking and I think I could combine all three by doing a renewable/natural energy career right? See, why couldn't my adviser tell me *that?* I do know these are what I want to do it is just that I thought by being in college my adviser would help me sort out all of this a little. I just got drilled and looked at stupid. 

**closing**
Maybe I am naive to all of this but it's not like I don't want to learn. I have the goals, they may be all across the map right now but I just need some guidance as to which ones are practical (in this economy), how to gain experience and what classes I should be taking. 

I do think sometimes that I am far too far ahead and confuse myself with all of this. I am hard on myself, often comparing myself to my friends that did stay in college even though like I said obviously they can do more things due to them having more education.. although not that much more in practical terms.

Anyone else gone through this or have any suggestions?",college,I never had a real adviser (long read),http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/nc8eb/i_never_had_a_real_adviser_long_read/,1323873474.0
1743,[deleted],1312570430,/r/college/comments/ja46c/a_question_about_having_your_acceptance_rescinded/,"I did very poorly in high school. I didn't care at all and I eventually dropped out and got a GED. After a year of laying around I joined the military and did very well in my schools and all aspects. I received about 50 some odd military credits. When I got out of the military I knew I wanted to go back to school. I am more focused and I actually care about my future. I got accepted as an adult transfer student to a very good private school and they accepted about 28 of my credits. Last week I got a call from the college telling me they needed my high school transcripts even though I am a transfer student as per NY state law. I am very nervous that they will take one look at my high school grades from around six years ago and they will revoke my acceptance. I am already enrolled in all of my classes, and I move next week and start classes thed last day of this month. My gi bill is paying for my apartment and if my acceptance is revoked I have no way of paying for it. Can they rescind my acceptance if I am accepted,enrolled and a transfer student with 28 college credits because of my terrible high school mistakes? Thank you for any help you can give",college,A question about having your acceptance rescinded,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ja46c/a_question_about_having_your_acceptance_rescinded/,1312588430.0
