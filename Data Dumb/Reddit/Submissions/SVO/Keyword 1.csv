0,GlitchyLui,1666102958,/r/college/comments/y78fsv/how_to_i_make_friends_as_a_commuter/,"Im a freshman in college at the moment and commute. I started back in September. I had friends from high school but they moved away to college, and they’ve found their new group of friends. I struggle with social anxiety and I’m neurodivergent, and it’s hard for me to talk to new people unless I know someone there talking with them. 
So far this year I’ve tried jumping out of my comfort zone and talk to people, but nothing has come out of it. They don’t talk to me or don’t seem interested in talking. I’ve tried talking about stuff we’ve had in common (ei. Art, games, fashion etc.) but it’s just so hard. It’s hard because if they don’t seem interested, I just stop talking.
I’ve talked to people like my bf (who’s in another country for college) and family about it and they’ve said to go to clubs, but I work. I work 5 out of 7 days right after school until 8 to be able to pay for college. I’m off Friday’s and Saturday’s but that’s when I have to bust out homework to catch up and try and have free time for anything. 
I feel so alone here. I’m only going to this college for one year too, so I’m trying to make the most of it. 

TLDR; how can I make friends as a commuter who struggles with socializing and works the majority of the week?",college,How to I make friends as a commuter?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/y78fsv/how_to_i_make_friends_as_a_commuter/,1666120958.0
1,velcrodynamite,1666076488,/r/college/comments/y6zkda/am_i_a_failure_if_i_leave_a_t20_on_a_fullride_and/,"I transferred last year from a community college to a T20 university. It’s been my dream school since I was a kid, but it’s been a nightmare for me in reality. 

Starting back in 2020, I was admitted to this school, but I was told by admissions that my one missing transfer unit (bc my class was canceled due to COVID) would automatically mean I’d be rescinded. So I did what I was advised to do and withdrew my application—only to be told three days later that I actually could have made up the unit over the summer but now I’d have to reapply for 2021 because I rejected the offer. 

Then it took me nine months to receive academic accommodations for my disabilities, meaning I was working twice as hard. 

Then I was assaulted on campus (I go to one of the most dangerous colleges in the country), and I had to get some trauma therapy for that. 

Next, I was robbed on campus. They only took some knockoff AirPods worth like $10, but still. Jfc. 

Then I was harassed. My classmates accused me of sleeping with my TA and him giving me an A only because he liked me. And I don’t blame them for thinking that; this TA was weird around me—he’d pay me way too much attention, try to be alone with me, say things that were very weird to say to a student, touch me, turn others away from his office hours, etc. When he learned about all this, he blew up at me and my department (also this TA’s department) suddenly felt extremely unsafe. I reported it, but all of that actively made my life hell for months. 

I was physically assaulted on my commute to this school last semester.

We had a lockdown triggered by a dangerous student who may have been armed for four hours and our school told us nothing.

The bureaucracy is unreal and it takes literal months to talk to a real person about anything, ever. The system is totally useless because of how long it takes to get any help. 

My $1200 bike got stolen, in my dorm’s “secure” lockup, where a thief somehow bypassed our ID scanner, cut through two locks, and got away in a place full of cameras. The school offered me zero compensation for this at all. 

Strange transient men keep wandering into my dorm and pulling their penises out. There’s SUPPOSED to be security guards at night in these buildings, but there’s not. Once, someone even tried to get in my room. 

The post-COVID attendance policies punish sick/disabled students. I had the flu and strep this semester already, and I was penalized for not coming in while I was sick.

It’s HUGE. This is a campus of 40,000+, and I’m not getting at all the kinds of one-to-one interactions I need to really feel confident in my classes. 

I’ve been miserable since day one, but I stay because I’ve been given a full scholarship. That and it’s a T20 with brand-name recognition. But I was so stressed last semester that I went into the hospital for a TIA/mini-stroke. Lmao, yes, a whole mini-stroke because of how much stress this school creates for me. Idk if the money or the name brand are enough. 

I have 82 units. If I can finish this semester, I’ll have 92. So, 30 more (3 more semesters). I don’t know if I can hold out for 3 more semesters. 

I could finish my degree at the much smaller state school. I’d be happier, but I don’t want to regret turning down my chance to attend this super impressive school for free. I don’t want to be a failure, and I’ll feel that way if I do leave. 

I’m already 27. I’ve worked so hard to turn myself around after failing high school. And now I’m a 4.0 student at a top school.

3,__notElonMusk__,1666021048,/r/college/comments/y6e9on/my_untreated_add_is_kicking_my_ass/,"I'm a senior in college (female, 22). I'm a senior right now because I'm currently on track. However, to get to where I'm at I have failed at least three going on four classes now. My degree is Fashion Merchandising and most classes are very strict about only being offered in the Fall or Spring. If you fail a class you have to wait until the next year of Fall. Since I have failed Three classes my date for my graduation has been pushed back. Today I walked into class and realized I had forgotten about an exam and also never received the paperwork for it. 

My professor who I have had for four years looked so disappointed in me and I was DEVASTATED. 

I usually try to put all on due dates on my Google calendar since I'm always on my phone it's a good reminder. 

Lately I have been dealing with money issues, my boyfriend and I lost our jobs around the same time and have been struggling to pick things back up for a couple of months. We had to borrow money from our parents for the first time ever and it was heartbreaking for me. My parents were very much against me moving out and I have been wanting to prove I can do it by myself and have done so for two years now. This week we finally got a break and found jobs for ourselves. I'm very proud of us since we both struggle with ADD. We have both been unmedicated for a long time and we do our very best at getting things done. 

I am currently crying in a hallway at school because of how angry I am at myself for messing up and failing a class for the FOURTH time now. 
I haven't failed it yet but now that I have missed that class, I would have to make perfect scores on everything else for the semester to even get a C-. I have tried doing that in the past classes I have failed and it is so hard to get perfect scores when I'm absolutely horrible at studying and math. My parents don't even know how many times I've failed already since they have their own issues to deal with. 

I am so scared because I've been telling everyone I'm a Senior now but if I don't pass this Fashion Ops class (it has a fashion Ops 2 class after it) 

I'll be here for another year. A year I can't financially afford or mentally take. 

My professors have become very concerned and have recommended I see counseling and financial help. I was recommended to the Disability center but since my parents lost my paperwork for my ADD I'll most likely have to prove I got it again. I'm very scared to ask for help as I have grown up with my parents saying my ADD is just an excuse and they were never really educated on it as they are now. 

I used to take medicine for my ADD from elementary to middle school but since it made me feel like such a robot my parents took me off of it. The medicine according to my classmates and parents would take my whole personality away, I went from a very hyper kid that was distracted so much to a silent robot that would freak my teachers out after they had complained about how much of a distraction I was. 

I could really use some advice or even people who struggle the same. My boyfriend is the only other ADD person I know of in my life. He can relate to me to an extent but no longer attends college as he dropped out his freshmen year. I feel incredibly stupid as I see my classmates in college do so well and get 90s and 100s. I struggle to get Bs in class and usually pass with Cs.",college,My Untreated ADD is kicking my ass,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/y6e9on/my_untreated_add_is_kicking_my_ass/,1666039048.0

I went to art school &amp; then dropped out &amp; got into loan default @ 20 which haulted me being able to go to college for a long time. 

I wish I had friends to go to events with in college like this distress event I wanted to go to where ppl were coloring pages. I am a kid inside like everyone else. I can’t just do school work all the time. It is so exhausting. I made maybe 2 friends, but I’d like to make more. I don’t want to just be tied to these same 2 ppl constantly.

5,Conscious_Sail9281,1665578396,/r/college/comments/y22vfl/should_i_shift_from_my_course/,"Hello! I am a 2nd year BS Pharmacy student, and my journey has not been easy.  Just a little background of mine, my family forced me to becoming a doctor.  We only have three choices in our family, become a lawyer or a doctor or nothing, and yes I am also Asian.  I was always uncertain of  becoming a doctor.  What motivated me to work hard in high school was that becoming a doctor would bring me to a lot of money, yet I was still unsure if I should pursue that career since I was not interested in the field.  I chose BS Pharmacy as my major because pharmacy can give me multiple career opportunities that I could take if I don't want to pursue med anymore.  This was how much unsure was I about my future.  

I applied BS Pharmacy in a whim, I did not ask anyone how hard the program was, how many days a week would you attend classes, etc.  I started my first year during the COVID-19 pandemic, and since we had online quizzes and exams, my college friends and I took the advantage of cheating and using ""control f"" from our powerpoints to answer our tests.  Studying the subjects for pharmacy was hard, especially inorganic and organic chemistry, so we took the advantage of googling, using ""control f"" and even taking pictures of the exam questions just to find the answers.  Overall, our first year grades were high, but that doesn't mean that we were drained.  

Since we were studying in the field of chemistry, we had to do our researches for our lab reports, answer mathematical questions, and even sleep late just to finish our assignments in time.  Honestly, I thought this was easy, since all we had to do was to cheat while answering tests, do lab reports, do assignments and study mathematics.  It wasn't all easy as if I were in elementary school again, but I was able to balance life well with this routine I had for my first year.  

For my second year, this was when things got rough.  There were already better outcomes from the COVID-19 pandemic and everything was becoming normal again.  Not only that our schedules got even more hectic, from 7:00 am to 5:00 pm, our classes are now scheduled at 7:00 am to 7:00 pm.  This experience was not good at all.  First, attending classes was draining, I couldn't believe that I need ed a lot of energy just to keep up with lectures.  Second of all, we could not do our ""control f"" strategy anymore to ""ace"" our tests, our examinations are now taken at university, and our quizzes are now zoom proctored (a second device will be showing the professor the gadget you are using while taking the quiz).  

It was hard studying for pharmacy.  Biochemistry, Medical Organic Chemistry, Biology, you name it!  We had to read and memorize powerpoints that are 70 slides long that will cover for just one quiz.  We have to now really work hard on memorizing terms and forget about the idea of taking tests like the way we used to.  This is honestly right, I mean we were cheating last year, so doing this strategy to check the students' integrity on their tests is a must, but I just want to say how hard this course is.  I don't usually get enough sleep anymore, sometimes I even attend classes with just 2 hours or less of sleep.  When I listen to lectures, I am becoming more and more uninterested, I try to listen to the best of my ability but I just hated it when they were discussing the topics and I felt that I should not be studying this since I do not enjoy it.  Studying was also draining.  I hated having to watch four 1 hour lecture videos for just one quiz and I am not even happy with what I was learning.  I hated that I have to memorize a lot of names for chemistry, I hated that I have to memorize a lot of definitions for true or false questions, and even if I really tried, I still fail my quizzes and exams.  I remember constantly studying for a quiz and I even slept only for three hours just to remember everything, but I failed it.  Most of our (yes my classmates also) examination results during our preliminaries were failing grades even if we worked hard.

I honestly don't want this course, I have a lot to memorize, 70 slides worth of terms and only 25 of them would be asked on a test.  I am honestly not interested in chemistry or science, I am more into mathematics, reading and social studies.  I am opting to not pursue medicine and pursue law school, since med school is obviously way more challenging and I don't want to study chemistry and biology anymore, it just drains me.  I don't know if I am just complaining like a baby about college or I'm literally enrolled in the wrong course.  I don't know what to do.  Honestly if I were to go back to freshmen year, I would have picked a course that is more suited for a prelaw, rather than a premed.  I am honestly more interested in law, and I do know this background since most of my family member except for my mother are lawyers.  What should I do?  Since any course could be a prelaw, should I make pharmacy my prelaw or should I shift from it?

Long story short, I have taken this class around 4 maybe 5 times now, and its just embarrassing at this point. I went to community college and barely passed with a 65/100 in my last semester then transferred to a 4 year school. I assumed since I had passed this class the credit transferred and I was smooth sailing from there. Well that was around 2 years ago now, and here I am in my 5th year of college, suppose to be finishing up and just found out in summer 2022 I didn't get the credits for it.   


The school wont take grades lower than C-'s from other schools. But will allow a student to get a D- at their school and let them pass. Now if it was only that easy for me. I have zero practice with math for years, and thought I could scrap by and get a passing grade, maybe a C if I try hard enough. Well first exam was completed and I got a 5/100. I was on the verge of tears as I took the entire length of the test to complete it and actually tried. this is one of 3 exams. First 2 are worth 20% each and the final one being worth 30%. This is a fully online course as I have to work to pay for my school and other life obligations.   


I'm currently trying the Khan academy courses and even going back to as far as algebra I, just to see if I can even do it at this point. I'm not even sure what I should study before my next exam in 4 weeks, as each test is randomized for every student depending on how well they did on certain topics (which there is 160 topics).   


I don't want to fail but I don't even know if I can pass at this point unless I somehow get amazing grades on these next test. What should I even do? This is a pre-req for a single class as well.

I understand everyone's tired of the ""I'm not a math person"" line, but I literally have never in my entire life past 8th grade have been good at math. I've tried Khan Academy and the fact is whenever I do math I have a lasting headache from focusing so hard to try and understand.

I was thinking of majoring in computer science and was attempting to study for the placement test, basically trying to catch up so I can take pre-calc without having to spend more time in school, but it literally causes me headaches which leads to nausea as I'm typing this.

I don't know if it's my anxiety or what but my brain is likely trying way harder than it should be for my age to understand high-school math.

I know this is going to annoy someone to cause them to talk about how they weren't a math person, but they eventually understood. I don't think everyone can be really good at a certain subject even with study if I'm being honest.

During my undergraduate I did really well grade wise and graduated Summa Cum Laude according to my school (3.91). However, I can only attribute that thanks to my family, the professors who helped me during office hours and HOURS AND HOURS of just banging my head.

However, during all that time, I still struggle a lot with proofs and linear algebra in particular. During my undergraduate I was able to get through my Foundations of Math and Foundations of Analysis course - my two proof learning courses prior to real analysis - and struggled a lot. I tried to spend my time during the summer to go through the book How to Prove It and it really helped out a lot to understand, but I still had a lot of trouble with my assignments and exams.

This semester I have Quantum Information Theory (QIT), Linear Algebra (LIN - proof-based), and an Intro to Applied Mathematics course (AIM). In LIN, I just got a 62, which I know is based on my prior proof skills and linear algebra. So now I'm just really overwhelmed. My homework is fine (As and Bs) but that's because I have a lot of time to think and I get stuck often so I have to ask around.

I think I'm also having a fear with asking for help with math at this high of a level, possibly because it's really hard to find anyone who CAN help at this level. I can ask for help with QIT more because in there a lot of it is really new to me so I almost have to ask, but in LIN I find it really hard for myself to approach the teacher for office hours. It makes it even worse that my class is in person so maybe that is a factor as well (QIT/AIM is in person). 

I'm usually a slow starter and then do a lot better towards the end of the semester so maybe that's a factor too.

Sorry if this is a jumbled mess, I'm just overwhelmed by the workload and some of the weaknesses I had during my undergraduate and it's showing in my performance through the courses.

10,birthdaythrowaway311,1665001434,/r/college/comments/xwl9ow/i_cant_handle_school_but_i_cant_leave/,"(Not US) Uni has only been in session for a month (I'm in 2nd year) but my mental health has gone down drastically since the very first day. I live in a country where the uni is in my 4th language, so there are occasionally some gaps for me and sometimes I miss certain information. This is especially the case because after the school stopped the mask mandate, EVERYONE got sick during the first month, and I got sick for multiple weeks so I had to take time off and keep going to doctors everyday (they don't let us miss school AT ALL without a doctor's note because apparently we are worse than high schoolers) Also my partner dumped me at this exact same time so that didn't help my attention.

Well, I found out the hard way that I missed a lot of pertinent info due to these 2 things. For one class I didn't know I needed a textbook and the teacher had known I was sick (she got my medical certificate) but he scolded me in front of the whole class saying I should've known that from the start which was really embarrassing. He didn't even write that we needed the book on the class info page which is where I tried to catch up.

I also find it harder to send in homework assignments than I used to, in fact I pretty much stopped sending them altogether last week. I stopped going to many classes altogether because I'm socially anxious and petrified that the teacher is going to call on me to give a homework response and scold me when I don't know, just like what happened in the class where I didn't have the textbook.

Most of my classes involve speaking in front of the class but I have such bad anxiety to the point where I nearly have a full mental breakdown, sometimes even in front of the class (and deep breathing doesn't even help at that point) Plus sometimes my classmates just laugh at you if you make mistakes during the presentations and that doesn't help. Also with the language being my non-native one I stick out like a sore thumb and everyone is always watching me closer than they do everyone else (and even admit it) Also people here are often really mean in general, most of my interactions with them are bad. Only the foreign students are nice to you if you are a foreigner.

I can't leave because I have a visa to be in this country and I am in danger of losing it if I drop out. Also, we CANNOT change majors. This is not a thing in this country like it is in the US. If I change my major it means I have to drop out now and restart the WHOLE degree from the very beginning next year (Fall 2023) Also you cannot change professors either, and the faculty does not care if the teacher is disrespecting you or not accommodating your illness because it is not a part of the culture of this country.

I feel like I'm at an all-time low right now. I was always an overachiever in my home country but now I have fallen so far I can't even see a way out. I can't eat or sleep properly, sometimes I don't manage to fall asleep at all because of anxiety and sometimes I sleep 16-18 hours a day from depression and miss class.

This uni is not accommodating to students with mental health issues despite being one of the most depressed countries in the world (wonder why?) so even if I got re-evaluated (was diagnosed with major depression, OCD, and anxiety as a kid) there would be no help on their end

Is there a way I can save my failing grade? This class is interesting in its grading (I think). Maybe this is standard for this school I don't know man. I'm just a transfer student.

Cutsoffs for letter grades are: &gt; 85% for A, &gt;75% for B and so on rather than typical &gt;90% for A

The 2 exams are \~20% of our grade and the **final exam is 41% of our grade.** I don't know much about  math, but uh that seems like a lot so maybe my grade can be saved with the final exam?? Maybe I can self-study so hard for this course and get a C. B ideally.

Is there anything I should consider in my decision to withdraw or not? Should I talk with the professor? Who should I even talk to? I just feel so lost. I guess I feel extremely indecisive in that this is my first semester at this university and I'm struggling so much.

I went to one semester of community college until covid happened. Life situations and issues also happened and I had to work full time to support myself. Throughout this however I still tried continuing my education part time. Ive earned about 43 units of general education so far, and a lot of Fs.
I currently have only 4 classes left to fulfill my general ed. When I realized this, I got super excited! Finally I’m getting somewhere right? That is before two things happened. 
I started looking up schools to transfer and I don’t know how to even go about affording these? All my classes in college have been free so far (my state gives us free tuition thank god) and I don’t even have a fully decided major. 
Not to mention, this last year I landed myself a job in a potentially lucrative industry (I can move up with no degree) and realize a degree isn’t even necessary for me to live well. 
I’m currently taking a comp sci class, and god this may be another F for me. My professor gives students 0/10 on completely functional code written after hours of hard work just because the documentation and notes you leave don’t look thorough enough. 
Its been insanely discouraging. I stopped turning in assignments because, who gives a fuck if I’m just gonna get 0/10 anyways?
Point is, I don’t want to end up in debt over a degree when ultimately a degree is not necessary to improve my quality of life. School is unnecessarily draining for me as well, I’m stressed and learning a fraction of what I would learn from youtube. 
Why am I even doing this anymore? Just to fulfill my childhood dream of graduating school? So I can likely be in debt and counterproductive in my career?

This is where I feel like I made the wrong choice. I am not happy here and I think it has deeper roots than the fact that its just different from home and I haven't fully found my niche friend group. I have no interest in being here and was never excited in the first place. I wish I would have thought about this before so I wouldn't have made the mistake of coming and now wanting to leave. I have tried to look at options to return home but nothing seems to be an option.

&amp;#x200B;

I really do not want to finish the quarter but my family and friends tell me its the smartest option and it will make transferring easier, but, I hate it so much that I would rather just drop out soon because I do not want to continue my schooling here. I've been told its a hassle and there will be consequences such as being behind since I may not be able to enroll in school back home until the spring or even next fall but I would rather focus on my happiness than being behind. It's hard to picture myself having to stay here just to make the transfer process easier. My parents don’t want me to drop out and do nothing for a semester or a whole year until I can enroll in school back at home so that's not really an option even though its what I want most.

Come grading, he gave a perfect score to my other colleagues, and gave me a low but passing score. I didn’t understand so I came in for clarification, I think he took it negatively as ever since then he gives me even lesser. 

At first, I thought maybe he’s a bit sexist?I’m a trans and all my groupmates were straight guys. I tried to shrug it off, as it was one subject and I managed to maintain the scholarship for the next term. 

Next term his subject was more up my alley, as it’s more logical exercises to do. Unfortunately, he still grade them how he felt it. I was the most active in class and was reciting correct answers but not in a know-it-all kind of way. It’s a hard class, so I wait until no one wants to guess the answer before I raise my hand. I thought this might change our dynamics for the better, but he still gave me a low score for that subject. Pulling down my gpa which might affect my scholarship. 

Now this term, I have him in 2 subjects. If he gives me low in both, I might actually lose my scholarship. I don’t want to bring this up with him, because I don’t want to ask for a handout. And it feels like he just doesn’t like me.

I'll give you a little rundown: I've been living in the same city for almost 21 years with extensive traumatic history and I was preparing to leave for college 2 years ago when COVID hit, but that college turned out to be totally different than I expected when I attended in person this past Spring. Last semester is when my burnout started - I was so unhappy with the campus and how many students were at the school because I couldn't form connections no matter how hard I tried. I transferred to a college back home so I could help my family, which made my burnout and mental health 10 times worse. My family promised to give me a good environment to do my studies, but it isn't working out anymore and those promises fell through. 

My mother has a mental illness (bipolar) and each day is a guessing game with her; she can either act like a normal mother to me or completely act like I'm her worst enemy. It has drastically gotten worse over the summer after I came back from college when I started traveling for the first time. I realized once I got home how much better somewhere else might be with my fiancé. 

My brother resents my mother. We have a pretty close relationship. Every week or other week there is a huge blowup with the two of them, which causes me a lot of stress, anxiety, and depression. My mother also dumps her emotions onto me, and I can't take it much longer. I turned into the parent instead of someone she can confide in as her daughter or best friend. 

I've looked into living nearby the school (I am in California) and it's either too much or nothing available at all. The campus dorms are just way too expensive as well. I have nowhere to go if I want to move out but out of the state where my fiancé lives. We are long-distance till I am done with my bachelor's degree, but I'm not certain if I want to complete it yet due to my lack of options and my mental health deteriorating due to my home situation. 

I'm almost 21, and I would be finished with my degree early next December a week or two after Thanksgiving if I continued going to school here. 

My mother and brother are supposed to start therapy soon (my mom starts in 3 days) and my brother started going to the gym with me during the week. I encouraged him to reach out to a therapist soon for anger management but he kept blaming everything on my mother. 

Do you guys think it is valid to withdraw till I'm in a better mental state? I have 0 motivation to continue my studies and can't see myself doing this for another year here. I know two semesters isn't a lot, but I honestly don't think I have the strength to do it. I think I would transfer my credits to a degree that is offered online once I'm ready to give my degree another go.

As the title says, I just started college and I think I blundered the social scene. People are making tight friend groups so quickly and I feel like I didn't make use of the ""meeting new people"" phase the best that I could. Part of it stems from the fact that I have a hard time meeting new people in general. Just going up to random people and saying ""hi"" seems so difficult. This is hard when I see someone in a group vs when they are alone, because I think that they have already established friends, so it would be weird if I asked them now. Even during orientation week, when I saw groups of people together going everywhere I already felt left out and that people won't talk to me.

Another reason for it might just be my ego complex. I feel that I shouldn't have to initiate every conversation or interaction I have with new people. When I see someone and I want to talk to them, I think to myself ""Hey, I'm going out to initiate with someone, but think of how many people have initiated with you first"" I know this isn't good, but I can't help but keep a mental count of how many people I started the conversation with, and how many people started with me. And when, someone does initiate, I feel an ego boost and think ""YES, someone ACTUALLY wanted to talk to ME!!!!!"" ""I am IMPORTANT!"" I can feel weak when I am going around having to start with everyone.

I think it might be due to high school experiences of one-sided friendships. I want to spend time with people and have to initiate hangout times, but I don't see the other people reciprocating the friendship or wanting to do things with me. When I see yet another new person, I think ""Considering how fewer people have initiated with me, it is not worth talking with them because they will think I am weird and not want to talk with me.""

Also, in high school, I have the baggage of being the socially awkward (and somewhat annoying) nerd. I tried my best to reinvent myself in college, and have the mentality of ""know one knows you are a nerd"". But my true self, can slip out at times. I also find it very hard to be a ""fake person"" and being genuine has always been a priority, making this task harder. I can't help but be the talkative nerd who is still receiving the same labelling that I got in high school.

I am struggling to think if my social life is over for me in college. I didn't attend any of the block parties on the first orientation week due to me sleepy at the end of the day. And with friend groups all closing in and settling, I am feeling left out.

I mean I have made a couple close friends in college already, and I feel very grateful for that. But another flaw in my mentality is that I see making friends as some sort of competition where you have to know more people than others. This is probably one of my other high school distortions as well as the most successful kids in high school, and the ones at the top of the class going to top10/ivy colleges had loads and loads of connections and friends. They would start companies with them, get internships and fluff up their college applications. I was also in the top of my class, but i feel like the rug is being pulled from beneath me where I will fall behind compared to my peers who are zooming ahead. People are always saying ""it is who you know and being able to communicate what you know that gets you success""

I don't know if it is over for me in college. Is walking up to random strangers and saying hi still acceptable now that some weeks have passed? Can I still reinvent myself and portray a better image? Or how can I seem more appealing, so strangers are willing to approach me?

29,banyamanamana,1662066032,/r/college/comments/x3igtx/i_need_advice_with_what_to_do_in_regards_to/,"Hello, obligatory I am on mobile. 

Back in 2020, I was dismissed from a four year university. I took a bit of time off, then began to attend a community college. Now, I fear that I will be dismissed from this community college. I have been put on academic probation and was doing the best that I could with my circumstances (will explain below) this term, taking three classes, but this term I can see I will be receiving an F, a D, and an A.

I'm not sure what to do. I live in an area with more than one community college. I can apply to another one. But I'm just not sure what to do. 

For a year before 2020, I had a hard time with school due to a lot of family arguments, violence, and abuse. Much of it was between my parents and their siblings, only some was directed towards me from my aunts/uncles. After my grandmother passed away in 2020, the arguments died down then finally stopped. My parents and their siblings no longer talk at all. But this has now placed my parents, specifically my mom, into a depression. I have tried to do what I can. I have tried to help my mom and family however I could but I have felt a lot of pressure in regards to family, and it didn't leave me with much energy or desire to do schoolwork. Now that things are a little better, I have much more desire and a little bit more energy. But occasionally, like this term, things just don't go well. It's a rollercoaster honestly.

I'm seeking advice in regards to whether I should appeal the dismissal (if I am dismissed), if I should apply to another community college, or if I should wait and only work and not focus on school? Personally, I am looking to go to dental hygiene school. Where I live, I have to apply by a deadline that is in the middle of spring term. Giving me two terms to complete prerequisites in order to apply for a dental hygiene program. I only have 4-5 classes to complete over two terms, which is very doable. But I already feel so defeated because of the possible academic dismissal that I may receive. 

Any advice is welcome. Thank you.

I actually tried a dorm for the first half of my sophomore year because I was extremely desperate to make close friends. What I learned was friend groups had already been established. Even worse, my roommate ended up being cold. He was also a year older than me and didn’t introduce me to anyone. I tried to make friends with him but he wasn’t having it.

I also understand that not every job is going to be 100% perfect, nor will I always be happy in said career cause I understand the ups and downs and how you have to compromise. But, I would like to try to get somewhat closer to deciding what I want and I feel at this point in my life I should be closer than where I am. I’ve tried SO hard to find out fields and jobs that I could see myself pursuing and every time I get closer, it falls apart. Here are some things I’ve done in my life that I feel has been a genuine effort to finding out my passions/hobbies and in turn, potential career options: 
* joined multiple sports and clubs in my teens 
* took several ec classes in high school 
* volunteering at local fundraisers 
* have had 4 solid jobs throughout my life ( one as a model + customer service ambassador for a bridal company, one as a retail store manager, one as a swim school teacher, and my most recent being a dental assistant- all which I enjoyed but could not see myself pursuing as a career or going to school for. 
* started my own small business during the pandemic where I made and sold crystal jewelry 
* got a certificate in beauty industry as well as interior design when I was exploring the arts 
* hired a career coach to help me narrow down field options and find my passions, which wasn’t very helpful if I’m being honest :/ 
* have initiated several informational interviews with people in different fields such as medicine, arts, hospitality, etc 

How come I haven’t made progress? How come I can’t find out what I wanna do? Why is it so much easier for everyone else? Sure, they might not know exactly what job they want but they at least are confident about their major or field. I know things I like and things I want and don’t want in a career, but for some reason I can’t get to a point of confidence and feeling like that purpose or passion is being filled. 

if you’ve read this far and would like to hear about things I have been thinking about then here : 
- I would like to get my degree FULLY online but am open to hybrid learning if needed
- 2-4 years ideally including pre reqs but am open to longer if needed 
- would like to have some freedom/ independence in my career ( I did NOT enjoy the dynamic of being an assistant and would like be able to grow to a position where I’m still under people but have a little more say) 
- job growth/demand 
- I tend to not thrive in high stress or pressure situations so maybe not something overly depressing 
- I work well with people and have a particular interest in animals 
- did not mind working in the medical field but it did fall into the high stress category a lot of times  
- Was hoping to be making at least $25-30 just starting off being I live in NY lol but I would like to make more eventually, so if I have to do more school to make that happen I’m willing.  
- Would want it to have benefits in some demeanor !! 
- Not having to travel a lot 
- Able to get job opportunities in multiple states 
-hobbies include cooking ( I’m vegetarian and love making creative meals, music, tv and movies, gaming, the beach, makeup and skincare, and being with my pets, friends, boyfriend, and family. 

If anyone can offer ANY guidance on where I can start, steps I can take, majors or careers that sounds compatible for me, or general advice that would be amazing.

36,Puzzleheaded_You3525,1661126035,/r/college/comments/wue5f0/dont_use_adderall_in_college_story_time/,"I was diagnosed with ADD several times beginning in childhood. I was prescribed adderall to help me in school and it was LIFECHANGING. I went from average B and C student to a perfect straight A obsessive focus lazer. Life was perfect. I loved studying more than anything else in life. It was my favorite thing to do. I could sit and study for an entire day and when I wasn't studying it was all I thought about. This went on for years until all of a sudden I my adderall wasn't working anymore at the highest possible dosage. I began to feel extreme discomfort unless I doubled down my dosage. Then if I didn't take it one day then I was a complete pile of worthlessness. 
When I finally reached this point of doom, this wasnt my only problem. I had pushed away everyone and everything in life. All my hobbies were zapped. I went from being a buff ass body builder with girls drooling over me to becoming basically a stick figure with no social skill. My life became miserable. I tried to balance my life by only studying every other day so that I could double my dosage on my off days. However it only pulled me deeper into the pit. I became worthless without my stimulants. I also had developed this sinking sense of emptiness in my life. So I tired to self medicate with non prescription stimulants. And this became the fastest road to a complete sh*t f*ck of a disaster that I've ever known. Within one single month I went from a 4.0 GPA at the very top of my classes to completely failing with several zeros. 
Now here I am several years later only just now beginning to take control of my life back with some very special help and even then it's painfully hard. 
I got back into bodybuilding and I started rediscovering hobbies. I'm regaining social skills steadily only via complete abstinence from any stimulants other than caffeine and occasionally kratom. Only after years did I begin to recover. Now I'm thinking about completely switching career pathways because I was blinded by the tsunami of neurotransmitter that the adderall gave me for years. It makes the most boring and mundane tasks feel like it's the best thing in the world. 
I don't want anyone to suffer the way I did.. so please do your self a favor and stay clear of adderall.

Due to poor choices from when I was younger and not as serious about school, I'm in bad academic standing with the school. Which means I'm not eligible to receive financial aid. One option I had was to make an appeal, which I initially did back in May. But as of now I have not received an official answer. I've sent multiple emails and made numerous calls leading up to this date, but no avail. I made one last call yesterday and they basically told me I'm fucked if I can't pay for the semester out of pocket. 

I tried looking at private loans at popular lenders like Sallie Mae, but they don't offer loans for my school. I guess you can't get private loans for a community college, so another option I looked at was transferring to a university early. That way I could have access to private loans, but upon looking at the admission requirements for a couple universities I found that I have to be in good academic standing with my current school to transfer, which I'm not.

38,CAPSLYTHERIN,1660945229,/r/college/comments/wsprnm/how_do_i_make_friends/,"Hi! I'm a freshman and moved into my dorm three days ago. For the first few days here, it's just been freshman running through a bunch of orientation activities designed to get us to know the school and each other. I've been trying my best to attend almost every event and participate. I've been friendly with my roommate and suitemates, and I've interacted with a handful of people at these events and gotten relatively friendly with them.

However, literally every single person I've had a friendly interaction with has a friend or friend group that they're doing everything with. My roommate is really nice but also has a large friend group (they're local to the area), some of who have been tight since elementary school. I've interacted with some of them and even tried tagging along once after she invited me but the banter is just so familiar with them that there's no point in trying to break in. I ended up just standing there in the background. I can tell they're just being nice to me and don't *really* want me to hang out with them. Some of them may even like me, I'm not saying they all hate me or anything, but I just do not see myself integrating into this group.

Same situation with my suitemates. Very sweet girls, had a great conversation with them the first day, and we've waved at each other when we saw each other around. I'd really like to get to know them better! I ended up having instant ramen alone in my dorm for lunch today and was treated to the sound of them and like four or five other girls laughing and joking in the other room.

I met a few people at an icebreaker event last night whose company I really enjoyed. I ended up passing them both today, literally one after the other, with their respective groups of friends.

There was also an orientation over the summer where I met a couple of people. I have seen both of them with their friend groups.

I was told it was going to feel like this, like everyone else at this school knows someone except for me, but *shit,* it really does feel like that. I was kind of laughing at it all at first, like of course it's going to be awkward and weird and so I'm gonna have a good attitude about any awkward moments or missteps or times I feel lonely. I've been making myself go to all the social events and to try and get into them, which is hard for me but I've kept up a good attitude I think! I mean, people have approached me and I've approached them, and I've had nice interactions. I really don't think that I'm like some sort of social toxin or anything deprecating like that. It's just tough to keep putting myself out there without any sort of safety net of a friend or something, especially when it seems like everyone else around me has that. I feel like it'd be so much easier to go to these things if I had just one pre-existing friend with me. Not even necessarily a close one, just somebody familiar!

I took a gap year after a year and change of virtual school, and I lost or lost touch with the majority of my friends from high school very early on into online learning. I haven't had friends in so long, man, and it's been even longer since I've made friends. I *did* get really close with my family over the past couple years, and I miss them like hell, my brother especially, which is kind of making everything suck more.

Is there something I'm doing wrong? Should I be more forward? Or should I just wait it out? I'm wondering if maybe I won't get to know the people who I'm having small friendly interactions with organically through classes or something, and I just have to hold out a bit longer. Or maybe I just haven't met the right people. Idk, all of a sudden it just got way harder to laugh at myself and power through the awkwardness and the out of place feelings. I'm thinking of maybe making an appointment with my school's counseling services to talk through all of this, but they're closed for the weekend, and by then my classes will have started so my situation might be slightly different.

# For Those Looking To Go To College

If you are in high school right now, and are stressing about the fact that you have to make a very big decision in the coming years about how the rest of your life is going to play out, please take a breather. Preparing for college and finding the best fit for you feels like it is the end of the world, but weigh all of your options and shoot for your goals no matter what. Here's some directed tips for making a good application.

Do Something in high school. It may seem like it's your time to relax and do whatever you want, but if you want to make a good argument for a college to take you in, find something you're good at and do something related to it. Join some clubs, play some sports, volunteer somewhere, take hard exams, don't do *nothing*. Something that I see all too often is people complaining that they didn't do anything in high school to make their application stand out, and the key to solving this problem is to just do *something.* 

Take the ACT/SAT seriously. If you are planning on going to a state school, and even in some cases other schools, the ACT/SAT is your ticket to some golden opportunities. I've seen some very prominent schools offer missive discounts on tuition if you do well on these exams, and for the most part they won't even consider you unless you have done fairly well on them or your parents are alumni/rich. For me, if I got a really good score on the ACT/SAT, my state school would nearly take off all of tuition, and so for 2 years I tried over and over to achieve that goal. Eventually it happened, and I got a very good discount on my education. If you are worried about finances when it comes to college, this is a *very important thing to work towards.*

Take more difficult classes. If you go into college with only base level high school graduate understanding, you are going to be in a world of hurt when you have to actually start doing homework for once. If your school offers AP level classes, I recommend to take at least a few to feel out a college level education. If your school offer community college classes for free, *jump on that opportunity as soon as possible.* It doesn't matter if you know what you want to do in college yet, just get the base level pre-requisite classes / general education classes done, as most transfer to most other schools. Classes like composition, psychology, and even oral communication are great options as nearly every major needs it. In my junior-senior summer of high school I took 4 courses at my local community college, as the tuition there was much cheaper than at the 4 year I was planning on going to. ***Understand what transfers and what doesn't, don't take any courses that will waste your money unless you are trying out a potential major you might find interesting.***

# For Those Just Going Into College

College is a scary thing, you're away from your usual life and being put in a situation that is uncomfortable and disorienting. The first thing to understand is that *every, single, person is feeling the* ***exact same way.*** There are those who like to pretend that it's cool and that they have it all figured out. ***Unless they've been to college before, they really don't.*** Understand yourself, take care of yourself first and foremost, and *then* worry about other people. You don't have to make friends with anyone right away, and not *everyone* does like some other people might be saying. Your college experience is *your* college experience. The faster you turn it into something you enjoy, the better off you'll be. So let's say you just dropped off everything in your dorm room and your parents just left, here's some advice.

Don't feel pressure to do anything you don't want to do. If everyone around you is drinking and they pass you a beer, *only take it if you want to.* If they get angry at you for not drinking it, then maybe they aren't the best group to be around. If you *ever* see hard drugs, (and I know I'm going to get flak for this, but oh well), stay the hell away from them. I have so many friends that have turned to party drugs and not one of them has ever told me that it has made them feel better about their life *while they were sober.* If someone's still buzzed, they'll tell you that they feel on top of the world, but understand that college and drug addiction is not a good combo for *anyone*. Ultimately, the choice is still yours, but if you don't want to waste the opportunity you've been given, please stay somewhat clean.

Don't worry about finding your own crowd. You'll see people walking up and down the streets in big 'ol groups and you'll probably get depressed if you're alone. Everyone feels the same way (for the most part) and don't worry about it. I've talked with *a lot* of college kids and almost everyone just randomly finds friends. It's not something you work towards, as if you build yourself up too much your anxiety will leave a bad first impression, and in college that's the only thing you have to base your relationships with others off of. Find people like you through time, and eventually you'll be fine, sometimes it just takes quite a while...

Classes. Hit your classes hard and heavy in the beginning. Take notes, read material, study, do homework, and actually *try* on exams. Humanity's worst enemy is regret, and by flunking the first midterm it will drag your mind for the rest of the semester. Do your absolute best and stay up to date in every class and *then* do the other things you want to do. If this becomes too difficult as the semester drags on, *take less semester hours next semester.* Nothing is more important than academics in college, and I'll explain why later. Do your best, and put forth the effort you know you can, and you will be just fine.

Stay away from time sinks (or at least limit yourself). Reddit, tiktok, snapchat, video games, etc. Nothing is more important than school, besides building relationships and maintaining yourself. Don't lay in your bed for 8 hours watching 30 second videos, don't take pictures of yourself and send it to your friends. Find time to actually go somewhere and study with them, and above all *make sure your current workload is done.* I see people all the damn time coming to me and asking me for extensions on homework's that are *2 weeks old.* Unless you have massive life events that have drastically altered your ability to complete work, please leave out the dull excuses of *I just forgot.* Your TAs and Professors are there to help you, not be your servant at your every whim. (And google is always an option, especially for certain questions.)

This one is short. Get a planner. remember them agenda things they gave you in elementary where you could write down due dates and shit? Turns out, it's really helpful in college too. This will solve your 'get hit in the head with an anxiety rush at 10pm realizing there's an assignment due tonight' episodes. 

# Finances

This is a biggy, a real biggy. College costs a lot of money, and there is no reason why you should have to graduate with any college debt if you *play your cards* ***extremely well.*** It does suck if you're late to the game, but a majority of tuition can be taken off if you do well on your standardized tests. If you're a first generation student, there's scholarships for that too. If you're a Brainiac, colleges will just take off a bunch of tuition for your essays you write for their scholarships. ***WORK DURING SUMMERS AND WINTERS IF POSSIBLE, ESPECIALLY SUMMERS.*** If you play this card really well, you can actually avoid working during the semester as well as you can have your savings you make during the off season pay for your rent during the semesters. If you need more for rent and food, find more time to work during the semester.  Be a TA, do research, work for your university, etc. Always apply for scholarships that you think you qualify for, and if you want to get a lot more of them, fill out the FAFSA to prove you demonstrate financial need. Take a semester off and keep building savings if you really need too, but most of the times the job you come out of college with can pay off your debt relatively quickly so save that option for desperate measures.

For me, I've already received so much in scholarships that I don't pay tuition anymore, just rent. This comes from having a high GPA, filling out the general application for scholarships my school puts out, as well as filling out my engineering general application as well. For most of the scholarships I have to write thank you letters to my donors, which isn't much for how much I am receiving from them. ***This is why having a higher GPA matters, it makes you stand out among other applicants on a very defined scale. The better you do in college, the less it's going to cost you in the long run.*** 

Don't go to college if you don't believe you'll do well in it. Trades is nothing to sneeze at when it comes to making money in life, and it's a much more affordable option when it comes to down payment. Doing bad in college is very costly, dropping out normally forfeits a lot of progress and results in you spending money for nothing. If you're dropping out for personal reasons, there's nothing wrong with it, and if you think there's better options out there in life go for it, but just know that not everyone is going to be a big businessman someday...

Tl;Dr Do what you want, college isn't the only option in life, and for a lot of people it probably isn't the best. Make of it what you want, and don't take too much advice from strangers on the internet (lol).

41,Smooth-Trainer3940,1660136898,/r/college/comments/wkx0w5/my_best_tips_for_being_organized_and_productive/,"Hey everyone,

I'm graduating in December (finally my last semester!!). I can't wait to be done with school, it's been a rough ride. But, I will say, I have learned a lot throughout my years in college. I thought I would share the most important things I have learned for people starting out or struggling with organization/productivity.

1. **Have a schedule**\- I'll start off with a general tip. Create a schedule that works for you. Everyone says not to take 8ams, but you know what? If you're a morning person and don't mind waking up super early, do it. I took some 8ams, they sucked, but they did help me find out what my ideal schedule looked like.
2. **Time-blocking FTW** \- Finding time to do what you want versus what you need to do is hard. For me, blocking out times of your day can really help. For example, I would tell myself that the first 90 minutes after my classes would be committed to studying. If I could get through those 90 minutes, then I would be free to do other stuff. 
3. **Don't be scared of to-do lists** \- For so long, I thought that making to-do lists was a huge waste of time. I thought, ""Why make a to-do list when I could spend that time actually working?"" Eventually, I tried it out, and I realized that having a list of upcoming projects and assignments can really help with being organized. I use Todoist and I create a to-do list for each class and just create tasks for each assignment. Plus you can set deadlines and reminders with Todoist so you don't forget to do your work. 
4. **Nike actually knows what they're talking about** \- The hardest part of getting things done is the getting things done part. Sometimes, there is nothing else to say other than ""just do it."" If it's a small assignment or will take an hour or less, just go ahead and do it, you'll thank yourself later. 
5. **Find processes that work for you** \- Everyone has a different way of doing things. For example, I like to make essay writing fun by using tools. I have always dreaded writing essays, but, for some reason, I find that if I use online tools to help me, it is actually kind of fun. I use Text Blaze for typing, Grammarly and LanguageTool for grammar, and Hemingway for editing. I found that this helped me overcome my dread of essay writing. But, everyone has a different process, so experiment and see what works for you. 
6. **Yes, taking breaks is actually a good thing** \- My final tip is to make sure you take breaks. I feel like this is definitely not a problem for most college students, but if you're trying hard to be productive, be careful not to overdo it. Do half of your assignment, take a break, eat a snack, talk to a friend, and then go back to actually finish it. Trust me, it helps.

I hope some of this helped. It's pretty general advice, but I feel like it might be a little useful. I hope everyone has a great fall semester!!",college,My best tips for being organized and productive in college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/wkx0w5/my_best_tips_for_being_organized_and_productive/,1660154898.0

On top of that, I was balls deep in my eating disorder. I'd fall asleep in the middle of my classes because I wasn't eating anything, or I'd miss them or waste time I could have put into studying so I could walk 20k steps. When I did eat I just felt terrible so I'd lie in bed all day or I'd abuse laxatives and end up spending hours on the toilet and days on end with horrible cramps.

I would also go through periods of time where I couldn't get out of bed because I was so miserable and my mood swings really consumed all of my energy. I eventually got diagnosed with Borderline and depression, got put on medication and started going to therapy.

I tried to pay attention in class as much as possible, but I didn't really understand what was going on. And once I got in the mindset that ""this is too difficult, I'm too stupid and this will never make sense to me"", it was hard to get out. 

As a result, I barely studied for my exams and failed a good chunk of them. I'm retaking them soon and now that I have the energy and strength to study, the subjects don't seem so unapproachable anymore and I can actually understand them fairly well. Sadly, there's so many of them that I don't think I'll pass all of them this round, which means that I'll have to retake the classes next year for the exams I'll fail again.

I don't blame myself for having these conditions that kept me from studying, but I do blame myself and deeply regret not seeking help earlier so I could have avoided all of this.",college,I regret messing up my first year in college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/wj3233/i_regret_messing_up_my_first_year_in_college/,1659963579.0
43,Funny-Grocery8459,1659932585,/r/college/comments/wizd2w/how_to_correctly_socialize_with_college_students/,"Greeting my fellow Redditors, I (20 M) am about to be a junior, and before I start, I just want to mention that I do not have social anxiety, I am able to read social cues, and my communication skills are pretty decent thanks to my summer jobs and volunteer work. 


Since my whole freshman year was done virtually, I spent all of my sophomore year trying to socialize with others in classes, and extracurricular clubs. However, one of these three things would happen …

1. either they had no interest in socializing with me
2. they would socialize with me, but would never get to a point of potentially forming a friendship
3. they would talk to me only if they need answers for homework

In regards to point 3, I am not an angle either because there were instances that I asked for the homework answers since my classmates have Chegg, and I don’t. I hold myself accountable for that, and this is a habit of mine that I will stop doing when I start college again.


Another thing that I should mention is that during my sophomore year, I even tried to hit on three girls I had a crush on (2 through Instagram, and 1 in person), who go to the same college as I do. To make a long story short, all three attempts were an extreme fail. What scares me is that those girls most likely told their friends about this, so now their friends will most likely see me as a desperate creep. I did have a picture of myself on my Instagram profile, so they know exactly who I am.


Lastly, when I’m looking at Instagram posts, I see groups of friends take vacations to other parts of the country during spring break, party, and engage in fun gatherings. Whenever I see this, I just ask myself, why can’t this be me, why can’t this be my college experience. Keep in mind most of these friend groups are athletes, so I would think they have it harder since balancing school and practices/games would be hard, but they are a million times happier than I am, and I’m not even depressed. Now, I am 100% aware that college is mainly about studying, and learning skills that will be useful to my future years. However, having a good social circle can make your college experience so much more enjoyable, and the amount of support I would have would be tremendously high.


With that being said, my questions to this subreddit is …

1. How can I correctly start a valuable conversation with them?
2. What can I do to form a genuine, and strong social circle?
3. If I were to have a crush on a girl in my college, what can I do to get her to approach me?


Any type of advise is appreciated, and I wish you all luck in your upcoming semester.",college,How to correctly socialize with college students?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/wizd2w/how_to_correctly_socialize_with_college_students/,1659950585.0
44,Kwagpin2,1659639809,/r/college/comments/wg9cl9/should_i_transfer_to_a_traditional_school_to_take/,"I’m about to be a sophomore at a dual enrollment high school that offers dual enrollment credits at a community college. It is called the “Early College”. The Early College is on the same campus as the community college. The Early College allows you to get your associates degree and transfer into any North Carolina Public 4-year University besides Duke due to an agreement. The school is low population (30-40 kids in my freshman class) and has some clubs but no sports and no AP classes. Most of the kids at the Early College are odd and would be labeled as weird or a nerd in normal high school which is one reason why it is kinda hard to make friends. I have had my freshman year there but don't have very many friends and no close friends. I talk to people during class and we work together and maybe crack a few jokes but im not close with anyone. I'm not invited to eat lunch by anyone and for after school events or hangouts I am never invited. The only time I was invited by a friend group was because one girl liked me. My close friends go to a traditional high school that is near the middle school I attended with them. My close friend group and I hangout frequently and play video games with each other a lot. This more traditional high school offers AP Capstone and AP classes and of course clubs and sports, but I don't do sports. This school also has a much larger population. Early into the year of my Freshman year at the Early College, about two weeks in, I was absolutely miserable and begged to transfer to the traditional high school. I did so but after 1 day I transferred back to the Early College because I was scared and was culture shocked by the different people and how large it was. I was a fish out of water because ever though I knew a lot of people since this is where all the kids from middle school went it was still different. My first high school experience was the Early College and even though I didn't like it, it was familiar. Before that I hadn't been in-person at middle school for a year and a half due to covid. Once I returned to the Early College I was once again miserable and depressed after about a month and would frequently break down and cry during school and afterwards. This continued for months but towards my 2nd semester and the end of school things kinda got better. I stopped crying about school. I talked to people more and had fun during classes. My relationship with my friends didn't really change and I still wasn't very close with them but I wasn't sad anymore. The reason I say we weren't close is because throughout the year I talked to them during class and we talked when we did work and we would have fun but after that not really. Once I went home I played games and hung out with my friends from the traditional high school. My friends from the Early College never invited me to sit with them at lunch so I sat with my older brother’s friends who have now graduated. And they only invited me to an outside of school event because a girl in their friend group liked me. I once tried to play video games with them but we didn't really click and they never asked to play video games again. Everyone at the Early College had friend groups from middle school but I didn't have anyone from my middle school. Everyone was close to their friend group so I was the odd one out, never close to anyone. Some people I didn't like and some people I thought were annoying and weird so it was hard to make friends when there was only 30-40 people to make friends with. Especially since this a special school advertised to be more academic it causes a lot of people who attend to be more weird/nerdy. The main reason I attended in the first place was because my older brother went and my parents forced me to. After this year for my junior year I am likely moving to California from North Carolina. Should I transfer to the traditional school? What would look better on my transcript and for college admissions? The traditional high school offers AP Classes and AP Capstone and the Early College offers Dual Enrollment. UCs in California are highly competitive and likely won’t accept my college credits but may acknowledge that I took them and show that I am college ready as APs would. Of course though APs are more traditional. Overall my Early College experience was rough but ended not as bad as in the beginning. Although I still do miss my friends from the traditional high school and feel lonely sometimes during school. As a very indecisive teenager this decision is eating me alive and bringing up bad memories from last year. So I ask you for some advice, from an academic and social standpoints what should I do?",college,Should I transfer to a traditional school to take AP classes when I am currently enrolled in a dual enrollment high school as a sophomore if I'm moving next year?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/wg9cl9/should_i_transfer_to_a_traditional_school_to_take/,1659657809.0

At first, I was excited to attend the Rasmussen University Graphic Design program for a B.A., then my experience quickly turned in to a nightmare. I already have an A.A. degree in Graphic Design, but I wanted to earn my B.A. so I applied at the **Rasmussen University School of Design in Ocala, Florida**. My Admissions Advisor was also my Student Advisor for a while. Before I signed any documents, **I explained** to my advisor that **I am disabled, recently widowed, and on a fixed income.** 

I told him I wanted to use my FASFA, but I wasn’t sure how much I had left for the year 2021. He said no problem, that **they had scholarships and grants** that would help me and **not to worry**, leading me to believe that the majority of the first semester would be paid for and I would only have a small amount to pay out of pocket. I **kept asking for their financial aid department**, but my question was basically danced around. I did briefly look at the part of the catalog I was sent but I did not read the entire catalog. That was a big mistake on my part. 

Rasmussen University is **unorganized, misleading, and overpriced.** My student admissions/advisor was ambiguous in how he spoke to me. Simply put, he was not very honest with me, and later I would discover they have **no financial aid office, only a collections department** in Ohio. No grants and the scholarship was $500 if I was able to get someone to attend Rasmussen. I **never signed a FERPA** either and from the way, the advisor was talking; It led me to believe that they were expecting me to do so. 

**Technical issues were numerous**, took days to get into tutoring, and it was frustrating to reach anyone on the phone. To be fair, I did have a terrific instructor for the 11-week term, however the other instructor in the 11-week term **showed videos from LinkedIn Learning** that were **hard to hear**, and **some videos were silent** altogether. Consequently, I just went to LinkedIn Learning as I was told to by my instructor. This infuriated me considering that it’s only $26.99 annually, and $39.99 monthly compared to **$299 per credit unit,** and their units for full time are 4 units per class, plus the cost of books and supplies. I was outraged by this.

Both 11-week semesters were located **somewhere** in Minnesota, and a few weeks into these classes, I was given a new Student Advisor located in Minnesota. Five and a half weeks into the 11-week semester, I was scheduled for a 5 ½ week semester that I was unaware of until 6 days after classes started, which put me a week behind. I should have withdrawn then, but I didn’t because I was focused on the work with the 11-week classes. The 5 ½ week class was intense, and there was a lot of work I was trying to catch up on while still doing work in the other classes. I focused so much on my work, trying to make the deadlines, and staring for hours at the computer screen, **I literally made myself sick**. I reached a point where I couldn’t see the screen, any screen, T.V. or phone. Everything was blurry, my eyes were red, and I was nauseated with a major headache. 

This is when **I had to stop.** There was no way I could finish these classes. I was working in **three different time zones**. **I’m in California, Pacific Time.** The 11-week semesters were in a **Central Time zone,** and the 5 ½ week semester that I was behind it was in the **Eastern Time zone**. The deadlines were confusing and because of Rasmussen’s technical issues; the time was not adjusted for homework deadlines. This made things very confusing. They also use **Blackboard**, which was just updated shortly before I started. The layout of Blackboard was **hard on my eyes,** the way they have their page laid out. 

It **took a few days** before I could get back on the computer because **my eyes hurt and were blurry**, but when I did**, I withdrew** from Rasmussen only **attending 9 out of the 11 weeks**. I didn’t attend the last two weeks of the 5 ½ week semester at all, but I think I might be getting charged for the full 5 ½ any way. I was **so disgusted** with the whole Rasmussen experience, and I was **suffering extreme anxiety** over the cost of attending. I went back to the student catalog and read through it carefully. This is when I became upset with myself. The **catalog is difficult to read** because they are **using small light blue/grey font on white**. Any Graphic Designer will tell you that you never use small light-colored words on a white background because it’s **difficult to read and the reader will just graze over it.** Just speculating, but I think this was done on purpose by the university so they can squeeze more money out of the students. I asked myself, ""*Is this really the university that I wanted to attend since they can’t seem to get the font size and color right in the catalog for students to read?*"" **NO!** What would potential employers think? 

After a week, Rasmussen finally officially withdrew me from the courses. I made two payments of $99. which I thought was locked into a payment plan, but evidently not because they raised the price to $100. I know it’s only a dollar raise, but what is going to stop them from raising the payment per month even higher anytime they want? At first, **I was told I could set a payment plan at a lower amount because I am on a fixed income**, ***then*** I was told that **NO,** **I could not do it that way** and that I had to have the entire amount paid off in 24 months. This **information is** **NOT** in the catalog! It appears that the collection department is the only department privileged to this **information**, and **they don’t have this information in writing.** There is **NO** **CONTRACT,** and there are **NO TERMS.** There is nothing to inform me or protect me from the legalities of this payment plan. This makes me very nervous. What business operates without contracts on their payment plans?

The advisors were **very pushy, using hard sell tactics, and trying very hard** to get me to **sign up** for the **Stafford Loan.** I was **adamant** from day one that **I was NOT** going to sign up for a **Federal Student Loan!** I think there may be many students that do because there are several documents. They desperately want you to sign up for the loan, and you just start clicking away. I also think that **the Advisors thought I did sign up for a Student Loan** based on how they were treating me and wanting me to take more classes after I sent in my withdrawal letter. Both advisors seemed shocked that I had not applied for the loan. The first advisor told me that **President Biden** was going to issue a **Student Loan Forgiveness** and not to worry. He said, *“Just Don’t worry about it, everything is taken care of.”* 

As a California resident, I get taxed.50 cents per $1000 by the state, so you can imagine how shocked I was when I had seen an **extra Tax charge** that **was quite large on my ledger card**. It took a few weeks to get this straightened out, but evidently, Rasmussen **had me down for a $40,000 program** when it was only **$25,000 for the Graphic Design program**. I was being overcharged, or since they are so disorganized and since I applied at the Florida campus where the Nursing school is, I imagine they thought I was a nursing student and not a graphic design student. I had two signatures on the withdrawal response letter. One was from the dean of the **School of Nursing, and the other was in Minnesota.** I only wanted to go to the School of Design in Florida, not Minnesota. 

This **hasn’t been their only money mistake** either! My amount kept going up and down because of adjustments. I was *told by the collections department* that I did **not pay**, until I sent proof from my bank statement and the receipt, then suddenly, they could see **that I did** **make a** **payment.** The month before last, I **received a call at** **6:30 A.M. threatening** me that if I didn’t make my payment; they were going to **turn me over to a collection agency** several days **after I made a payment** that had already cleared, and I had a receipt for. ***Isn’t it against the law to call someone that early in the morning?***

After I withdrew from Rasmussen, I looked around to see if any other students had problems with Rasmussen University. I see plenty of them, but more **shockingly were complaints from employees.** This tells me everything I need to know. If this is happening to me, then how many other people has this happened to? How many other potential students will be treated as I have been treated? How many are experiencing the same thing I am experiencing now? So, I contacted The California Bureau for Private and Postsecondary Education, California Department of Consumer Affairs. 

Today, August 1, 2022, I tried to log into the student portal, and I get a message that my Rasmussen email **does not exist**, yet **I can access my Dropbox** associated with the email. I was on the phone for 2 ½ hours getting different answers and trying to figure out how I was going to make my monthly payment, which I was finally able to do over the phone. I was told that emails are deactivated six months after withdrawal, **NOT mentioned** in the catalog. To the best of my recollection, it says to contact the collections found in the student portal to make payment arrangements. Then I was told it was because the email has not been active for six months, which I **was just on there a few weeks ago,** and once a month to collect my payment receipt, so **what are they talking about?** **Why can I still access my Dropbox**? Why **can I** **not access my email** to get to the student portal for me to get to the collection department to make a payment and see my ledger? This is **ridiculous!** 

Rasmussen has been a **total and ongoing nightmare** for me. We as a nation are going through difficult times, and **I feel as though I was taken advantage of** during these times of tribulation. Attending Rasmussen with everything that is going on politically in California and in our nation has left me in a deep depression. 

If you’re thinking about attending Rasmussen University, I **encourage you to carefully read the catalog even though it’s difficult to read.** In my opinion, Rasmussen is nothing more than **a Diploma Mill**. It’s a **for profit college**, and you’re better off staying within your own state. Classes are cheaper, and you may find your state offers incentives to go to college in your own state. **Stay clear** of **for-profit colleges. All** they want is to **make a sell**, *your education is not of importance to them*. *I don’t want to see anyone go through what I’m going through,* especially if you’re on a fixed income and disabled.",college,"Rasmussen is nothing more than a Diploma Mill,",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/wevut3/rasmussen_is_nothing_more_than_a_diploma_mill/,1659515813.0

Freshman year started out really well, but over time, my friend group shrunk more and more as people started branching out slash we realized we didn't all mesh well. By the end of freshman year, I could confidently say that I only had three friends, two of whom are in a relationship and spend all their time together and the other who doesn't seem very interested in hanging out with us anymore. I have had to eat lunch and dinner by myself multiple times, and I go to a really small liberal arts college where I somehow NEVER see people eating alone, so it feels like a punch to the gut. Also my school is so small that everyone kind of recognizes each other, to the point where I would have had serious misgivings about attending if I had not gotten a really good financial aid package. My three friends are fine, but I am really having a tough time making new friends.... I made a couple acquaintances in my classes, but I doubt I'm ever going to see them again -- we just made small talk before class, stuff like that. No one leaves their doors open in the halls, none of my dormmates talked to each other, and I was also randomly placed into a dorm of all juniors and seniors that already had friends.

I had a lot of friends in high school and I feel like making friends in college is just so different. Back in high school, I was friends with completely random people because high school kind of forces everyone to get to know each other. I could make friends with people who didn't share any interests with me, because we got to know each other's personalities over time and there was no need to instantly bond. I was friends with the most straightlaced people imaginable, extreme nerds, people who partied and did drugs all day, jocks, etc. I liked all of them a lot and we had no problem hanging out outside of school because we knew each other. I feel like in general I tend to make a lot of lifetime friends -- I'm still friends with all my high school buddies, and even some from middle school -- but college has been INCREDIBLY lonely and isolating in comparison. It feels like everyone at my school learned how to make friends the ""college way"" but me.

College is like...you have to instantly click with someone. Or you have to continually do things with someone in order to stay friends with them, e.g., partying. I've had people invite me to a party, and I went, but then I felt peer pressured because I love partying but not every freaking weekend and it became really hard to keep up with those people socially until I just didn't anymore. Sometimes I want to be a huge nerd, but I don't want to do that all the time either. I never felt like I had to fit a certain niche or cliche or whatnot until college. This has also been an obstacle for me when it comes to making friends -- it seems like all the party people want to do is party, and it seems like all the non party people want to do is stay in. I'm trying to find the people who like both, or who like going out but not necessarily to a college gig, but where are they?! 

It's just really hard. I've tried my best to be social but it's been difficult for me to be ""on"" all the time. The clubs at my college are also a lot more limited than I realized -- like, what if I want to nerd out, but I DON'T want to join the D&amp;D club? What's my next option? -- and I also was randomly assigned a single, which I was happy about at the time but now I wish I had had a roommate to befriend. I also am worried because I'm going into a major that has literally zero social interaction, no projects or group discussions or anything, and am considering stuffing my schedule with an art or yoga class just to find friends. I signed up for a random roommate for sophomore year literally just to make a new friend, but her social media is completely empty and she never replied back when I emailed her introducing myself. So... 

I used to joke about people who peaked in high school, but lately, it feels like I'm becoming one of those people. I just don't know what to do. People here have recommended keeping the dorm doors open, but no one at my college does that. Join clubs? The options are really limited... Join a sport? I was somewhat of a jock in high school, but I really don't want to re-enter that world. Go to parties? I have, but even when I chat with random strangers, I never see them again... Rely on your roommate? Didn't have one last year, and this year's hasn't responded to me. Make study groups? I've done that too, but we never CLICKED, like we treated each other cordially but pretty much never hung out after that.

Even when I have a good time with people in college, it's so hard to hold onto them. I just want one group of friends I can hang out with at mealtimes and on Friday evenings.

IDK. College is just hard. It makes me sad. It's supposed to be the best time of your life, but I find it a LOT worse than high school.",college,Struggling to make friends in college and feeling extremely lonely!,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/wdvdsf/struggling_to_make_friends_in_college_and_feeling/,1659413214.0

I am a stickler when it comes to money, how I spend it, and where it goes. The cost of the cafeteria for a 14 meal plan is 3.5k per year, for, you guessed it, barely edible food. My problem is I'm gluten free and I have no mode of transportation to get food elsewhere, so finding better options is hard.

My biggest problem with the vendor is their promise towards accommodations. Unfortunately, my allergy us severe to where even the kitchen, with flour in the air, can make severe stomach and joint problems for days. I've struggled as a piano major from this cause and I was at risk with losing my good standing grades. I have confronted the main chef and accommodations office time after time after time and mistakes still occur to where I can't eat food at the cafeteria because I'm scared of experiencing pain during a performance and had to sustain myself with whatever a friend could bring me. I used to send emails every week after looking at the weekly menu only to be told that some foods listed as gluten free were mislabeled. They don't even have a separate room for allergies, hence the cross-contamination.

very quick current situation:

in high school i was very naturally good at humanities subjects- english history etc. I pursued humanities, specifically english, in high school w/ all my extracurriculars relating to it and applied to schools as an english major. do not be fooled by the terrible grammar and sentence structure of this post i am just very impatient. 

I got in to a top 30, non-ivy, school, and started freshman year doing english. i just finished my freshman year, and i decided not to do english anymore. here's why. 

explanation:

in high school i did not try. any subject that had a ton of detail work and effort, such as sciences or maths, I would barely study for. For my chemistry class, I studied the night before every time and got an A+. biology was an nightmare because it was a lot of effort due to memorization- i did terribly. for my math classes I would scrape by with an A, studying maybe an hour before the exam. this contributed to my perceived struggle in math and science. this perceived struggle was not helped by the fact that from a young age, i was extremely proficient in writing and reading, so i never once tried math and science and only pursued english and anything related. 

i had a lot of mental health problems, social issues, family problems, and procrastination problems in high school, which may have factored into this. 

i never truly considered what i was interested in. everyone praised me for being good at english.  i was not mentally well and constantly looked for praise and validation from others because I was very insecure, so i desperately pursued it. I read complicated novels, I bought difficult texts. Sometimes i really like it, but sometimes i feel like it is just so i feel smart and special instead of any real interest in the subject. a lot of the time, i feel like i don't understand it. for example, i really struggle sometimes with essays because I miss something important and completely misinterpret it. but other times, i write an incredible analysis that the teacher calls out and reads in class because it is so good. 

the truth is, i hate writing. i hate it. i hate writing essays. i hate writing journalistic articles. anything like that*.* **the only time i do like writing is in my philosophy classes when i'm writing very analytical, logical essays.** 

another thing to consider is what i want in the future. many english majors want to be a journalist, they want to work in publishing. but i think i would hate that. i hate writing blurbs and reporting articles. i hate doing work that isn't a big challenge. also, a lot of people don't like me and i don't have very good social skills. the only thing i like is editing and criticizing papers... i would want to pursue further degrees in english but only if i could become a professor, which let's face it, is very near impossible.

so, taking this into consideration, i tried classes in international relations , econ, and philosophy. i loved econ and philosophy. it was so logical. it was challenging, but i was very good at it.

however, i really don't want to work some random econ job. if i was to pursue econ, i'd want to go to a PhD level, and i am not a math genius. for philosophy- how would i ever get a job in that? I would pursue further education, but then what? very low possibility of ever becoming a professor. 

here's what i realize i want out of a job/ career. i want to continually learn something, i want to be a master of the subject. i don't want work some job as ""operations manager"" or whatever in some corporate office, even if im earning a million dollars. not looking down on those people who do, but i really love learning and i just want enough money to live comfortably (preferably in a big city though). 

currently i think i'm going to do economics and philosophy. but i don't like any of the jobs that come out of that right after college, and graduate study also seems.. idk. i really would hate to work a normal corporate job, where you just do the work and get payed. i know some people really enjoy that lifestyle, but i don't think i would. 

**tldr: i want to do something challenging, but i don't know if im good enough. I never tried at anything in high school and only did things to be praised, so how do I know what I like?** 

i know i want to devote myself to my work. I want to do everything for one subject i love. here is currently what I am thinking. 

architecture: i am very good at design (long story). math is challenging, but interesting. it also combines things like philosophy and art history, which I love. It seems like a worthwhile profession. however, i'm not sure if its the kind of design i like. 

pursuing philosophy PhD: i mean, it is possible. just, what would I do after. 

law school: i love arguing and being in a competitive environment, but I don't want to work a corporate job after law school. i also say i like being in a competitive environment, because i like competing with other people to be the best. but from what i have read about law school, it seems more slimy. i also don't think law itself is interesting. i have bad social skills tbh. and i am bad at public speaking. 

trying out sciences/math: i want to try to take a Computer Science course or Physics course. I did really well in chem because it was so theoretical and flopped in bio because it was all memorization. should I? I am running out of time. is this just wishful thinking that I could be good at these and enjoy them? 

anyway, i'm kind of freaking out. i'm in my sophomore year and everyone is already getting great internships and research experience. i would appreciate any advice.",college,what should I major in (hard mode)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/w7fm0i/what_should_i_major_in_hard_mode/,1658742187.0

So im in high school and i wanted to have a career advice from a person who’ve been in the same stage as i am, and ended up succesfull with proper work. He suggested me to go and do my best in that area. He’s very well knowledged about these stuff and experinced the whole process so i trust him and appreciate every minute he spend to explain me these stuff. Him and i share a very similar view of the whole thing, our complainments and reasons, as well as outer factors are similar too. He’s definetely more realistic than i am, which im glad. 

But i thought what if i trusted him because we share the same povs and opinions about stuff, like hearing my ideas from a lot better person in this area could make me a bit too excited. He suggested me to take a risk, which im a bit scared to. 

So i asked my best friend about this. Lets call him J.(I forgot to explain the thing, it is me wanting to go to college abroad)J also wants to go abroad but not in college but rather for masters degree. But J also considered what im considering now, and appareantly he has a realitive that studied for sats but found it hard etc. 

He says theres no way i can get full scholorship and says its just too hard. Wheres the person i talked to said i could do it after our talk. I honestly think the person i talked to is overall better to take advice from in this area. My best friend wants the best for me i have no doubt however i feel like he doesn’t bealive in me and also it seemed like he was not looking from my persepective and just advacoted his own trues that benefits him. Because he seemed defensive whenever i told him a thing.

 Also he often tries to make me change my school into his school just for fun, but tried to change my mind saying its academically better and stuff like he told today and i honesly lost a bit trust to him.

53,taez358,1658025008,/r/college/comments/w0wt9b/i_got_rejected_at_orientation/,"It was towards the end of day 1 where you initially get all your information about the school and how it works. Towards the end, the group leader put together a series of games that are meant to further break the ice and get everyone acquainted. Me and the people I'd met earlier were having fun and decided to end the night with a game of pool and whatever else seemed fun at the time.

 It was then I came across one of the prettiest girls I'd ever seen. She was chill, cool asf, and had this aura around her that I just seemed to gravitate to. She was also with some friends and was playing a game of pool. I'd recently made a resolution with myself to get out there and start being more confident and sociable than I was in high school. So I thought that now was a perfect time to put myself to the test and make my mark in a new environment with new people. But unfortunately for me, the version of myself that I wanted to portray did not go to plan. But I do have to say I did come out my shell a lot more than I was used too. So that was a plus.

I walked over trying to be as nonchalant as charismatic as possible. I changed everything from my strides to my tone in which I spoke. I asked her if she wanted to play a game with me and my friends and she said she'd watch, but she wasn't a good player. I said alright and thats when I started to try a little too hard. For the most part it was fine up until out of nowhere a backroom started blasting music suggesting a party was starting. The girl got excited and wanted all of us to come. Me trying to shoot my shots and hopefully have them land was all for it. Except I wasn't the party goer and it got really awkward. Already out of my comfort zone and not sure of what to say or do to sound cool, things started to dip out of my favor. Especially when it seemed like the girl liked my friend more than me...

As the party is going down, I desperately try to get her attention and be funny. She didn't really play me too much attention and was more busy with her friend. My friend, who is an extrovert and super social, knows exactly what to say and when. He gets the girl going and laughing and dancing all while I'm in the back trying to compete. I was no match and needless to say, it was embarrassing asf. Seeing a girl who I has told my friend about effortlessly hit it off with her hurt me in a different way, one I can't explain. I left the party defeated with my confidence feeling like it shriveled up and died in my chest. The next day it gets even worse.

I thought about it all night and decided to give myself one last chance to get with this girl. Or try to anyway. At breakfast the next day, I told my friend how I felt and he agreed with everything I said. He said he noticed my attempts, but when told how much more she liked him more than me, he didn't say much. I asked him if I should try to pursue it and he said absolutely and was all for my resolutions and what I was trying to do. In fact all my friends were. They persuaded me to go talk to her and try to at least get her to give me her snap. I swear to God if I could go back and never went through with this, my whole remaining summer would have not have been so focused on what went wrong.

I approached her so hesitantly, it was noticeable and cringe. She didn't even acknowledge me. I approached her and asked how she was feeling the night prior, and she looked up and answered with a smile that was obviously fake. I started to get the hint that she didn't want to be bothered with me, but not knowing any better and pushing too hard, I kept going. The more I talked, the less she responded and she began moving away subtly each time. Long story short I ended up asking if she wanted to come back to our friends hall and party before we all go and right before she answered, her friend came out of nowhere and started conversating with her. It was like she was waiting for someone to bail her out and when that time came, she jumped on it. I finally got the hint and again, acknowledged my defeat.

Before the end, I kept looking her way when she didn't noticed and kept imagining if I was a more fun person like my fiend, I could be walking with her and laughing and what not. But it never happened and even now a whole 3 weeks later, I'm still replaying those parts of my memory.

i had to do a 6 person project with another girl bc none of my other teammates wanted to do their parts. i stayed up late doing everyone else's part and trying to perfect the paper to the best of our abilities. i ended up falling sick from staying up late every night for the last 2 weeks and was also under immense stress (i have a sore throat, migraines, body aches, nausea and a low grade fever). i went to the doctor to get a doctor's note to say i can't come in. i emailed my professor and asked if i could take the finals at home since it was online, she approved that i could take it at home. 

however, 3 hours later, we got an email saying she received an influx of emails with doctor's notes and excuses from students saying they cannot come in to the exam. it was very unlikely they were sick, and actually wanted to get out of the exam (bc travelling all the way to school for a 30 min exam is pretty ridiculous). she said that if we did not come in to the exam, she would not grade our exam. i went to the exam, and had to wear a fever patch as my temperature was fluctuating, i also had body aches, was groggy and almost threw up while taking the exam. 

i tried my best to do it to the best of my ability but i wasn't able to retain information the night before bc of the fever. i got a really bad grade and i had a breakdown as i missed the margin to score an A, let alone an A-. this would also mean it will affect my chances of getting my honors due to my GPA. i want to write an appeal to her, but i'm not quite sure what to say to her, and i can't stop being angry at myself. i want to say i did my best, but i don't think so.

Atm I’m a 3rd year Biochem major in college (also a pre med) and my gpa would be considered high but not super high (not in the 3.8-4.0 range). My grades in high school were similar- definitely above average but obviously a genius I suppose. I’m fairly pleased with what I have accomplished so far and grateful I’ve had conditions to do so. That said, I understand a lot do what I say will also apply to me to an extent. 

I had been reflecting on some of the reasons I had a slightly lower gpa than I’d like (typical pre med I know) and I boiled it down to:

Being at home during the quarantine (my house is not very conducive for learning for reasons I’d rather not share)

Not trying as hard as I could’ve early on with one or two classes (which I acknowledge as my own fault)

And then just having professors that didn’t mesh well with me in terms of teaching I suppose

Going off of the last point, I feel a lot of frustration because I know I definitely tried my hardest in said classes. Maybe I didn’t study properly for said class or I wasn’t able to adjust to how they tested the material right away. Or something, idk.

But regardless, thinking about all of this and occasionally doomscrolling on Reddit or Quora, has made me feel a little insecure I guess. I’m specifically referring to how some people make it sound as if getting a 4.0 or gpas similar to that are solely a result of working hard I guess or wanting all As badly enough. It feels a bit insulting I suppose. Like an analogy would to this would be like telling someone the reason they lost in a video game or sport would be because they didn’t try hard enough I guess. Or at least that’s how it feels to me. 

What sucks about this btw is that I personally internalize it somewhat. I know I tried my hardest in some of these said classes and yet I feel so flipping lazy compared to some other high schoolers or college students also working hard and succeeding in ways I never did/ don’t. I don’t say this out of jealousy or spite per say, just wondering if I’m just not as great of a student as I thought or if I’m just a lot less hard working than I thought. Or if what I’m saying is me realizing that I’m not really all that special / more normal than I thought.

I know everyone is different and everyone’s path through high school and college and life will be different and will affect them differently. I know this. But still here I am. Comparison is the thief of joy- I’m very aware. I just don’t like it when people make it sound like working hard is all there is to it I guess. I understand it’s also a working smarter not harder thing at times too. But I’d just want more people to acknowledge that there are many other factors usually at play and maybe some luck involved too (which I have noticed more people are beginning to mention when talking about their grades/ success).

56,Gloomy_Performance71,1656815903,/r/college/comments/vq7fqq/should_i_continue_being_friends_with_her/,"I need help. Sorry in advance for this long post, but I'll try to make it as thorough as possible. Let's call my friend Lola. Lola and I have been pretty close friends since our Junior year in HS. I have some priorities and she has hers, but that's her business. However, it pains me to watch her make the wrong mistakes. And sometimes, I may push too much into her business, but that is my human nature. My mom is the same exact way. I am the type of person who likes to plan things out before they happen and I research things before committing to things especially when it comes to College. It's hard to notice when I go too far. Here are some examples...

Lola and I have been studying Business Administration in HS together and are both majoring in Business in College. When completing our Freshman Year, we've been majoring in Accounting because our moms told us to. After completing one course that involved Excel, I realized Accounting wasn't for me, so I changed majors to Business Management concentrating in Human Resources. However, Lola stayed in Accounting because she didn't know what else to study in Business. Fast forward to our Sophomore Year at CC, we're both transferring to the same 4-year University next semester for our Junior Year. We've talked about rooming together and being closer, but things are changing between our customs. I've done my research on my major, booked my housing assignment at school, gone to orientation, and enrolled in my classes. On the contrary, Lola has waited to sign up for her orientation and was only able to get the orientation AFTER mine, which resulted in her only getting some of the classes she needed in order to progress in her academic career. I asked her if she's still doing Accounting, and she chose to change her major to Supply Chain Management and that she'll have to stick with it no matter if she likes it or not because it'll be her Junior Year and she won't be able to afford to go to college another semester/year if she changed her major again. She also decided to not get a rooming assignment and will be commuting to school every day since we both live about 30-40 minutes away. I only found out until I initiated the conversation and asked whether she got a room with me or not. Therefore, she will not get a meal plan, which will mean that we'll have even less time to see each other. Usually, she doesn't tell me any details about what she's going through, even though we're both going through the same thing at the same time and wanted to room together next year.

She also relies a TON on her parents. When I asked her how her orientation went, which I had to ask her about, she told me she went with her mom and never spoke with other students. Normally, prospective students make one or two friends at orientation but she never branched out at all. I went by myself, and so did most of the students there. I am deeply introverted, and I was able to make about five new friends. 

To mention another example, I got a retail job during the summer after my Freshman Year in college to get job experience. Lola did not. She always made sure to do summer courses to stay ahead, but she might have a harder time finding at least an internship without any job experience when competing with other applicants. This summer, I was looking out for her and asked what she was doing this summer. She said she wasn't doing summer courses this summer and was taking a break. So I asked was she working then because most college students either work or do summer courses over the summer when they have the chance. She said no. So she'll just be ""sitting around the house being unproductive."" I worked to save up for my dorm decorations, and I almost got everything I need and am still making purchases.

I then asked her what was her plan during college, and if she was getting internships. She told me she may be getting internships, but I know she'll struggle to get them. However, I kept it to myself. When she asked me what I planned to do, I said that I planned on getting internships and getting multiple certifications either before or after I graduate. I think I made her sound like she had no idea what she was doing, but how couldn't I?? She was able to enroll in about two classes with me next semester, but it'll be awkward because we won't be nearly as close as we used to be.

We just seem to be on different pages. She seems to be too reliable on her family and doesn't want to branch out. She's also screwing herself over because she's not researching her major before committing to it. I feel like I'm trying to stay friends with her, but she keeps ""pulling me down."" I have a strong feeling our friendship will die once the school year starts.

I need help, and every day I struggle or cry out of nowhere because I cannot move on from what happened to me recently. I have this only one subject that I failed; also, it is the first time to fail a subject in my entire schooling wherein even in my secondary education, I did not experience failing a subject. For my part, it hurts because I am also an achiever--from first to the third year, I am a dean's lister, and I am aiming for Latin Honor when graduation comes. All of my grades this semester are all high, all nine, the highest is 99, and the lowest in the 74 grade--WHICH IS THE FAILED MARK. I am trying to achieve it because I am not trying to feed a pride to boast or prove something to anyone, but as a person who has low self-esteem, it is a joy to see that I am growing and I have this sense of accomplishment wherein it is a way of validating to myself that I can do what others do. However, when I graduate I will never use this to step on other people, but I want credibility and wider opportunity in the future or my profession. It hurts because I've worked so hard since day one, and everything will be affected and ruined because of only one failed subject. I will never get a Latin Honor dream because of only one subject that affected my qualification and academic standing to graduate with honors.

I have emailed my professor. She already did a consideration, and she will never change my grade because, according to her, it will be unfair to other students. I understand, but I can see that I am only the student in our block who failed. It is also unjust because I find the subject hard to understand, but I still did comply with her requirements, and I never submitted late output so that it would not affect her judgment towards me. I told her also about my situation, financial capabilities, and academic standing, but she was still firm with her decision not to pass me. I only needed one point to pass. I just want her to give me a passing mark; I am not asking for a higher grade. Just pass me.

 I know the subject is really challenging, and I learned some. However, I still find it hard to understand sometimes due to complex terms and too many readings. I sometimes do not have time to focus on the subject because I also have other requirements for the other subjects that are impossible to finish in only one day, which all have the same deadlines. I am also a daughter with many responsibilities at home, wherein I also have terrible parents who expect a lot--which is common in Asian family culture. I am not generalizing that all Asian families are like this, but most are, wherein I find it toxic sometimes.

 My professor advised me to retake the subject. I am retaking the subject and do my best again, and every day I email her even if she is not responding. I still cannot move on. I do not find any motivation to continue to study or live. I cannot bear the pain. I want to focus on what is in front of me, but I still cry. I always find myself frowning and giving fake friendly gestures to people because I am really sad inside. I am trying to build my self-confidence, but it is again losing. I feel dumb.

Also, I tried to reach out to our school dean and department head, but it seems like the professor is really the person who holds the decision to pass me. 

 Please help; I need your advice. How can I convince her to pass me?

Thank you so much for your effort in reading this. I don't have someone to talk with.

I hope that my story can bring you some confidence to continue your journey. I am a first-generation college student currently 24M and have three siblings, 22F, 32M, and 31F. I first started college at 18 and immediately all of my siblings disapproved of my decision. My brother wanted me to become a truck driver, my older sister thought I would not be smart enough, and my younger sister did not believe I could go through with college. I dropped out of high school at 18 and got my GED the same month and enrolled in a medical assistant program, graduated at 19 from the program. When I graduated none of my siblings congratulated me or showed up to my graduation. My mother showed up and was proud, she is a first-generation U.S citizen who raised 4 children on her own. She has always wanted all of her children to get an education. I quickly learned that medical assisting was not my end goal, immediately after my completion I wanted to enroll in a community college to earn a higher degree. My siblings again disapproved and started bullying me out of my mother's home, so I moved out. I lived on my own and worked two full-time jobs and finally at 21 years old said I am going to live my dream regardless of what anyone said. I moved back home and enrolled in a community college to finish my associate's in arts and sciences degree and to complete my pre requisites for dental hygiene. I was bullied out once again and said I will do this. From 21 to 24 years old, I moved around a lot while finishing my degree and prereqs and finally I am where am at today. I finished my degree with honors and got accepted to a bachelor's dental hygiene program that I will start this fall. Very competitive program to get into, as many apply for 2-3 years to get in and I was fortunate enough to get in my first time applying. I am proud of myself. I chose not to walk for my associate's degree because I did not want to become sad over seeing other classmates be cheered on by their entire families, and I would have just my mother in attendance. I do plan to walk for my dental hygiene degree though. I have not been congratulated again by any of my siblings for my graduation and or my acceptance into the dental hygiene program. Throughout all of my years going to college my brother was extremely unsupportive and would often talk badly about school and how I need to work at the local mine where he currently works. He has tried to convince me to drop out of college countless times and I would often ignore him because he was very negative. There were times when school was extremely difficult because I worked 54hrs a week as a CNA and had to do college at the same time, and I would often be told by my siblings to just drop out already or take a year break. I did not listen to any of them. I stopped talking to my sisters because I was too busy and did not have time to be lectured about how college was a waste of time and that I should just work at an auto parts store like their significant others. Nothing wrong with working in the mine or at an auto parts store but that was not my goal. I remember during my two-year break from college I tried to make them ""proud"" of me. I had two jobs and applied to jobs like at home depot and I remember them being supportive of those things. But when it comes to going to college and working and applying to dental hygiene programs they were very negative about it. I love my journey, although it is two years away from being finished officially I am happy I was able to overcome negativity and continue my story. I think back to all the times I could have easily folded and ended this. I think back to the negative comments. It made me a better person, I am happier, and more supportive of all others around me, regardless of their goals. I applied to four dental hygiene programs and knowing how competitive it was I applied to a radiology tech program prior to see if I would be accepted since they are less competitive, I was accepted but turned it down. I remember telling my family this and they all told me how big of a mistake it was, and how I won't get into dental hygiene. I was waitlisted for all the programs I applied to and they would repeat this often. Luckily I was accepted. The reason I shared that little part was just to show that no matter what I did I would never make them ""proud"". So school became less about doing it for my family and more about doing it for me and my future wife and kids. I know they will be proud and I know I will. I guess what I am trying to say from this is whatever your goal is, and if your family or friends are unsupportive, or like in my case just flat out rude and discourage it. Chances are they will never support anything you do, so might as well go for it. So many times I thought about dropping out, or that I wasn't good enough or smart enough. Now I can bring home a degree to my hard-working mother, and tell her it was all worth it.

59,haynb03,1655485453,/r/college/comments/vekrms/im_at_a_loss_for_how_to_pay_for_college/,"I (19F) have just recently started college this summer. It’s something I’m really passionate about because I’m a workaholic and I also love to learn. I’ve already made some amazing people through college and I’m establishing a daily routine I’m incredibly happy with. College is definitely something I want to stick with.

That being said, I have no idea how this works financially. Neither of my parents went to college so I have no guidance. The only person I know that received a college education is my aunt, and I recall her telling me you don’t have to pay off student loans until after college (although I think there are also ways to pay them off slowly while in school). I liked the sound of that, so I didn’t worry about finances when getting myself into this.

I’m slowly learning that student loans are a completely different thing than getting charged by the college itself. The school is expecting $3,500 by next week and I don’t get FAFSA help until the fall. I tried to fill out a FAFSA form to help with this summer but there’s trouble I guess since I didn’t provide my moms tax information when I needed to and I don’t have a special reason that would allow me to be exempt from doing so. I didn’t provide her information because when we tried to fill out my FAFSA for the fall we both got really frustrated and emotional not knowing how to navigate and find the answers it needed (like I said, neither of us have done this before).

I don’t know my options or the repercussions if I can’t pay the college next week. I’m trying to figure out how to apply for a private student loan but I’m not finding a lot of resources for that either. I shouldn’t have jumped into such a large commitment so blindly but I also think it shouldn’t have to be this hard.

If anyone has any advice I would really appreciate it, because I’m feeling really scared, broken and discouraged. I work in fast food when I’m not doing school and my mom already works multiple jobs just to pay the bills. There’s no way I can provide this money on my own.",college,I’m at a loss for how to pay for college…,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/vekrms/im_at_a_loss_for_how_to_pay_for_college/,1655503453.0

67,Ykanasaytta,1655311202,/r/college/comments/vcyqo0/i_cant_afford_the_gas_to_get_to_class_every_dayi/,"There is a lot of back story to my post so I will try to make it as short as I can. 
My husband and I were living about 30 min away from my college when I went back in 2020. My father-in-law decided to be really generous and offered to pay to help me finish my degree. (I had taken a break for a few years because the financial burden was too much) 
Of course I am so thankful he is covering the big part, but that means we are covering the rest. That was no issue when we were sharing an apartment with a “friend” and were splitting rent three ways. Well, in Jan. 2022 our friend came up to us randomly and said “I can’t afford to live here anymore. I am leaving.” Leaving us completely high and dry and saddled with paying 3500 to buy out and the remaining time we were there. My husband is fresh out of college so he isn’t making much and I was working part time while doing classes full time. (The reason I had left years ago was due to burn out, so thats why I wasn’t working full time) So given all that had happened… we didnt have the money to stay there and had to spend what we had to move out to my mother in laws and on breaking our lease. 
Fast forward now, gas prices and rent are through the roof and we now live 1.5 hours away from my college. My husband is made to travel back and forth 2-3 hours each way for his job now because of our relocation. Given the current gas issue, I calculated how much we spend in gas for the both of us and we are spending almost 60% of our income in gas alone. Given that I have a part time job and that he makes the most money, I have just been driving to a local coffee shop to do my school work instead of going to class because we just cant afford it. 
The worst part is that my FIL insists I don’t work full time because it could lead me to burning out again and he doesn’t want to “lose out on his investment.” With that, I try not to bite the hand that feeds me. 

My absence is not hurting my grade too badly, but I know this isn’t sustainable. I am desperately trying to finish my degree while staying in line with what my FIL is asking and making sure my husband can go where he needs to for work. I work long hours on the weekends to try and pull in some extra money too. It’s hard for me to work during the week rn because it takes me 4 hours back and forth to go to school and I am in class for 3 hours a day. We live in a small rual town and most things are closed by the time I get home. 
Is there something I can say to my professors that could help? Or should I just consider myself screwed? I tried talking to the dean od students office and they said “it will be a while before you can get a meeting. Only thing I can suggest is a hardship withdrawal.” Is that an option? Has anyone here ever had to do a hardship withdrawal?

And was pretty unhappy my entire adult life. I'd work jobs I hated on and off for money. I've tried to start college a couple times in the past, but they were false starts. I've spent ungodly amounts of time of just doing nothing but living in my small bedroom. From 18 to 26, it was all depression. 

I'm not entirely sure why, but something is different now. I once again returned to school, this time starting in the Spring. Somewhere in the process of paying for classes, mapping out my desired class schedule for the next 2 years, knowing what career I want to pursue, and what university I want to transfer to, something clicked. When Spring started, I began to feel happy about being in school. It's like for the first time I can see a bright future for myself.

I was partially worried that I was just in a honeymoon phase, and that I'd eventually drop out again, because that's what I've done in the past. However, as the semester went on my motivation never dropped. Even when things got hard and stressful, I never had the thought to quit. I finished Spring with an A in all 5 classes.

Currently, my 4 week mini-class just ended (A), and 2 summer classes I'm in started a week ago. The workload has been absolutely overwhelming. And I fell behind pretty hard. This passed week has been *rough*. I honestly thought I was going to start missing assignments, and possibly might even have to drop a class, because it felt like I wasn't going to catch up. I only slept for a few hours last week up to now, but I did manage to get caught up. It's honestly shocking to me. I never grinded for something that wasn't in a video game. This is somewhere old me what have quit in a heartbeat. Yet, I never even considered it.

I have a newfound resolve, and that's a new thing to me. It feels good. I have things I haven't had before. Drive, ambition, motivation, discipline.

This new class of people leaves me feeling hopeless every day. I try to socialize but I usually am interrupted or ignored, or have to fight for attention.  

There's a group of like the 6 coolest kids, and everyone else has to fight for their attention. They are also mean to other people in the college, they are very dry in responses to others. 

I tried to hang out with the rest of the classmates, but they are also dry and untalkative.

It's very hard going to college because of this. This is a weird shift for me, as I always had a lot of friends in my high school and in my former college and loved my classmates. 

Going to school before was a pleasure for me, I had fun every day. But now, I always get anxiety at the thought of going to school..

I became very nostalgic, and always think about memories with my former classmates. 

I am now struggling with social anxiety, nostalgia and constant sadness because of this shift. It makes me resent my current classmates.

I still try to make jokes or engage in conversations. But because of the anxiety, it's hard. I used to never have anxiety in social situations and don't know what to do to feel like my true self again. I never felt like I had to fight for attention. It makes you feel so crappy.

74,momentbr,1654112258,/r/college/comments/v2pcok/cant_decide_if_i_should_transfer_having_serious/,"Hi everyone. I (19f) finished up my freshman year of college last month at a very expensive, well known private school in Texas. I am on a scholarship to go there of $100,00 over four years, as well as a smaller scholarship of $16,000 over four years, yet I am struggling with seeing this as a worthwhile investment. $100,000 at my school seems like nothing. 

Some background info, I graduated in the top ten of my (public) high school class and I took a lot of AP classes, transferring a ton of credit to my college so that I will graduate in 3 years instead of 4. In high school, I was always pushed by counselors and teachers to “do great things” and attend a big, important school to get an amazing job. I was taught that my academic hard work would pay off, and college would buy me. I planned on studying history and entering special collections/archive work my senior year of high school. Long story short, that did not happen and I am a studio art major. This school is not the type of school where you’ll meet a lot of art people; the major itself has fewer than 50 people, if I were to guess. 

I hated my college in the first semester. It was awful and I never stayed at my dorm. In the spring, it got better, but I still was never proud or excited to be at that school. To make matters worse, every time I thought about my shitty experience, I thought about the exorbitant amount of money my family is spending on it. Yet, I wanted to make it better, so I tried out for and made the school’s spirit team. This is something I’ve looked forward to because I did spirit for three years in high school, and my college is a part of the Big 12 conference, which means that I would get to do spirit at a high level. This is also a big part of my issue.

Since probably October, I have considered back and forth transferring to a public school that costs around $10k a year (mine cost $40k in loans for my first year alone). On scholarship, it would probably cost me $6-7k. However, I have trapped myself in the sunk-cost fallacy where I think that it would be wasteful to transfer when I’ve already taken our $40,000 in loans for one year at my university. Why pay off a loan for something I didn’t go through with, you know?

My current school would give me the opportunity to have a well-known, respectable university attached to my degree, to learn and hone my skills in small, personal classes, and also access to great resources. The other school would make college so much more affordable, thus allowing me to change my major and/or double major. Since high school, I’ve always wanted to double major, but at my university doing so would only launch me further into debt. I can’t even afford to minor in anything. My family is pretty well-off, but these loans ultimately have my name on them in the end. At the public school, graduating two years from now wouldn’t be of ultimate concern either because it doesn’t cost an arm and a leg. I could take my time to get where I want to be rather than rush to save myself from debt. I’m seriously considering taking the fall semester off to work and take a couple of classes at community college to ease my way into transferring and adding a major in psychology to my plan, before entering the public school full-time in the spring. I’m interested in pursuing art therapy and education as a career.

I know that the answer seems obvious to transfer, but I’m struggling. I feel like I have the eyes of all those who believed in me to do big things on me right now, and it’s a LOT of pressure. I look back to my high school self and I know she would be very disappointed. I think of the great connections and people I’ve built at my university, the potential to do the spirit team, and the opportunities that a private school brings, and I stop myself from proceeding with the transfer… but then I think about if those opportunities are worth the debt, and if I could get them just the same in public school. 

If anyone here has been in my shoes before, I want to know what you did to get through it. I want advice from anyone who has it. Is the name of the school really that important? Can I get a good college experience at a public school? I regret my decision to go to my school every day, but I still get cold feet about leaving.  I think about the money and my stomach churns. As the cost of schooling creeps into my mind, my love for learning and academica that  made me love high school dies. I don’t know what to do; I genuinely feel trapped. I wrote transferring off the radar a few months ago and reconsidered it last night after talking to my mom. I’m tired. I’m taking summer classes at community college to ease the costs of my school next month. That community college works directly with the public school I’m interested in.

Where do I start? How should I approach this? What would you do? Please, any advice helps. I want to love school again, and I want to feel good about my decision. I just don’t know what would be best because I’ve already invested so much time into my current school and I already have a solid plan to graduate in 2024 with a BFA.

I was doing so well before this, and I actually enjoyed college. All of that went down the drain very quickly, and I realized that I was not cut out for my chosen major. That and the fact that this was the first time that I wasn’t living with my family. AND the fact that I had some *new* mental health stuff pop up that just made everything worse.

It’s over, and I can’t find anything else that I’m interested in. This has lead me to consider joining the military more than once, at least I’d have direction then. But we all know that it can be an absolute shitshow, which is why I’m having such a hard time making a decision.

78,thoushallstealmemes,1653302255,/r/college/comments/uvx9tt/accounting_major_needs_help/,"Hi, I'm in my senior year taking up Bachelor of Science in Accountancy. I was done with my virtual internship today in an accounting firm, which caused me exhaustion and sleepless nights. And now, I'm just informed about the pre-board examination (like a mock licensure examination for CPAs). I'm having anxiety rn. Idk how to handle it because I failed most of my assessments during the enhancement course or review. I'm not really the smart kid, a below-average student if you would compare me to my block mates.

I used to have so much potential. I used to ace out-of-school writing competitions with other private and public schools within the city I live in, I even compete at the regional level. I was once a leader of numerous school organizations and a participant in extracurricular activities.

Things just get out of hand when I stepped into college. Since I was a kid, I always dreamed to be a nurse, but due to financial incapacities, my fam suggested taking BS in Accountancy as a college course instead. My freshman year wasn't so bad since I already have the background in major subjects, I was even included in the dean's lists which is actually good because if I maintained that till senior year, I might graduate as cum laude.

Then sophomore year came and there I started to fail my quizzes and exams. I only excelled in general or minor subjects. That's when I realized, Accounting isn't really for me (though I already knew this since the very first day I step into that class).

We are more or less 60 students in our batch and before the junior year began, using the GWA threshold, the list was down to 19 students only, the rest was forced to transfer to other courses (or other schools). Surprisingly I was included in the 19 remaining students. You have no idea how I doubted myself so much, I even asked the secretary of the department if I was really included on the list and if that was final. He said yes. So I use this as a motivation to keep going even though I have no idea of what path I am taking. I studied hard, I tried to fit in..

The pandemic came and studying became more challenging for me. I wasn't used to virtual interactions, especially during classes. I struggled with abrupt switching to virtual classes and online exams. I failed more quizzes and exams for 2 years and counting.

Senior year, it took me 1½ semesters to finish my thesis. During those time I was taking foreign language (Nihongo) and other major subjects, too, until now. I am also taking an unofficial review for the licensure examination, here I always fail the assessments. Every meeting, the guest reviewer for advanced financial accounting and auditing will show the names and results and I was embarrassed to see my name and failing scores highlighted in red. God knows how I tried to study soooooo hard just to prove I really belong here in this field, but I don't know how on earth I still fail those assessments like I never even study. That's when I decided not to take the licensure exam in the future. We are currently under a new guest reviewer, and I can say I feel a little more relieved than the former one.

As I have mentioned, I am done with the 600-hour internship today. I thought my anxieties will be gone this time but the announcement about pre-board came. I don't know what to do. If I will base on my performance during the review, I will definitely fail this pre-board exam next week. The names will be posted on the campus and I'm expecting my name to be on the bottom rank as it always do. I don't know what to do anymore. I always find myself staring out of nowhere and will suddenly cry, worrying about my future. That future will start after my graduation in July (if lucky). I honestly have no concrete plans. I absolutely want to take my dream course (Nursing) but besides the financial factor, I feel like I'm lacking out of time at just the age of 22.

Since COVID, school has just not been a priority for me because I realized how useless all of it is, I also haven’t been able to focus on doing schoolwork at home at all (Yes, I’ve tried the study tip you’re about to recommend. No, I don’t have ADHD.) and I’m very naturally academic so most of my classes get boring unless it’s a subject I really enjoy or more project-based.
I think AP classes this year were the first time I felt like a class was genuinely hard, and that was mostly because of the volume of work I was expected to do with little time to do it. I don’t enjoy being in school and I want to focus on myself, my hobbies, and making an honest living.

I have good grades and test scores and can go where I want, my main concern with college is that I’m going to be wasting money on something I don’t want to do that won’t really help me succeed in life.(Everyone goes to college now, it’s not hard to get a bachelors and in my mind it will not set me apart from anyone except for dropouts, it just proves you could get passing grades for four more years.) And it will jus make me miserable for another four years.

Everyone tells me that I need  to try college before I knock it, that it’s super different from high school.

Hello all. This is my first time ever making a reddit post but I've been wanting to do this ever since I made this decision months ago. This is going to be super long, so I apologize. Hope you enjoy and resonate with something.

Going into college, I was pretty clueless on where to go and what I wanted to study (like most 17/18 yr olds). I had always valued academics and so did my family, my ACT was a 29 and I had a 4.0, so I knew I was able to get into most schools. I grew up in an extremely boring small town in Ohio and I knew I wanted to go out of state, but that was it. I applied to schools in Florida, Hawaii, Ohio, California, Connecticut, etc. All over the place. I found a university in central Florida, and I was intrigued. Their application was easy, and I got in. The school is known for giving out good financial aid to its students, and this was true. I got a good scholarship with grants to help alleviate the absurd ticket price of tuition and board there. So I decided to say fuck it I choose to go there, without even visiting the campus (I tried several times to see the school, but I was never able to because of conflicting events). Florida; beaches, palm trees, good weather, and it was consistently ranked one of the most beautiful schools in the nation. What could possibly go wrong?

At first I really liked it. My freshman year started Fall 2019. Everything was so new to me, and I had no issues making friends and meeting people. I was adjusting to classes well and really had no issues. Hell, when I went home for breaks I couldn't wait to get back. But as time progressed, I found myself thinking about transferring from time to time. I had told myself that the only school I would ever consider going to in Ohio was Ohio State. I really liked Columbus and I loved being in a city.

Fast forward to the end of freshman year, it was cut short by c\*vid and I was super sad and couldn't wait to get back to school and Florida as a whole. Boy was I wrong. I had a terrible Fall '20 semester. I did great academically but my social life had plummeted and I got really depressed. I would leave to go to class, come back to my apartment and see my roommate, but that was pretty much it. I had other close friends I would hang out with, and I went to the gym frequently, but it was overall a terrible semester, mostly due to the college making terrible decisions navigating through the pandemic. I felt so alone all the time. I felt like I never met anyone new and doing anything I enjoyed was hard to come by. So my thoughts of transferring started to increase a lot.

The next semester (Spring '21) went much better. Things were more normal and I met a lot more people, one of them becoming a best friend to me. I even met a girl halfway through the semester and we really hit it off. I wasn't looking for a girlfriend at the time, but I could tell she was worth it, we had a bunch of things in common, and we meshed super well. I had applied to some schools to transfer in the fall, but my advisor and close family advised against it because I was already half way done. So I decided to stick it out and stay another semester.

Fall '21 semester was interesting. Things with my girlfriend were going so great, classes were going good, I had good friends, but progressively my mental health began to drop. Going to a small university in Florida where the general popularity of undergrads were Greek Life or athletes, I felt insignificant and like I did not matter being a regular student. A lot of my friends were athletes (including my girlfriend) but I still felt like I didn't belong. I never really found a group of friends with similar interests and it honestly sucked. I would go home and visit my family and friends, and every time my breaks ended I did not want to go back to Florida. Eventually it got to a point where I broke down to my girlfriend midway through the semester and told her I didn't know how much longer I could stay at the school. It took a lot of courage and I did not know how to tell her. The point is, I was not happy there no matter how hard I tried. All I did was think about how I didn't belong there and that I wished I transferred somewhere else. I was able to recover a bit mentally, get through finals and everything, and flew back home to Ohio for winter break.

I had an incredible winter break back home. I spent a lot of time with my OSU friends and my friend group I usually hung out with, along with my family too. I DREADED going back, and it seemed time was just melting away. A few days before I was supposed to fly back home, I broke down completely to my mom. I didn't know what to do, and I was running out of time to think about my options. I knew that if I did another semester at my school there would have been no point to transfer for my senior year. I would practically be almost done. So I ran the idea of taking the semester off by her and I couldn't stop thinking about it. Taking the semester off would give me ample time to figure out what I wanted to do. I called my girlfriend that night and told her that I was considering taking the semester off, and we couldn't stop crying. She told me she didn't want me to leave her. I was still really on the fence about things.

I was a mess. My dad dropped me off at the airport and I hugged him for the longest time and cried to him telling him I didn't want to leave. The entire time on the flight I remember thinking how if the plane were to crash at that moment, I would not have cared. I ubered back to my apartment from the airport, and went straight to my bed. I didn't eat, and I couldn't get myself to get out of bed. It was like this for a few days. I was running out of time. The semester was starting soon and in order to get a full refund on tuition and everything I needed to decide really fucking quickly. I talked to my parents and older sister on the phone. I sobbed in front of my girlfriend as I talked with her about things. I loved my girlfriend so fucking much but I knew I had to leave. I knew if I had stayed for this semester, I would have only been staying because I didn't want to leave her, and I felt like that was not fair for myself and well being. I knew I had to do this for **myself**. **I knew it was best for my situation and I didn't see the point of me spending thousands of dollars in tuition at this school again if I hated being there.** I went through with withdrawing from the school, packed everything in my car, and drove home to Ohio.

That is the story of me taking the semester off. It was the hardest decision I've ever made and man, it's been a rollercoaster the past four months. I've dealt with so many feelings. Some days I have felt that I have made the right decision for myself and other days I feel like a i'm a fucking idiot. Many times I have thought to myself ""You were so close to being done there, you couldn't stick it out for three more semesters?"" My girlfriend and I tried to do long distance, but we did not realize how difficult it would become. A lot happened the past four months. We got into a lot of disagreements. I even visited her for a week during her spring break and it was amazing to see her. She ended up breaking up with me a week and a half ago and I can't help but to feel at fault. I know this would not have happened if I had not have left. Things were so amazing with her but I ruined it because I had to leave. I took a big risk making this decision for myself and this I guess this was a repercussion of that decision.

**At the end of the day, you gotta do what's best for yourself and your well being.** I knew I was not okay mentally and I made a big change. It's been really hard and I've been dragged through the mud the past two weeks. I am set to transfer to Ohio State in the fall to finish my last year. I know things will get better soon, It's just been tough seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I've been through a lot over the past four months.

That is almost everything. Or at least the best possible way I could say things to an audience who has no context of my life. I cried typing this and put a lot effort into it. Anyone who takes the time out of their day to read this, just know I am so appreciative of you hearing me out.

82,hellokittynyc1994,1652299144,/r/college/comments/unihvf/going_back_after_academic_dismissal_from/,"This is a bit of a long back story so you don’t have to read it but if you want to: 

I was academically dismissed from my undergrad computer science program at a state liberal arts college back in 2018. I was supposed to graduate 2019. I was not as responsible as I should have been and was overwhelmed with the pressure to do a a major I wasn’t good at/interested in because of my asian immigrant family refusing to pay for my education otherwise. I was only allowed to go to school to be a doctor, lawyer, or engineer and I chose computer science because it seemed the most accessible to me but it was just not my style and my family would not let me drop out or change majors. I also had undiagnosed ADHD as well as suffering from depression after being injured and unable to walk normally for about 4 months. I was unable to get up and walk to class and I was so overwhelmed with the work I was missing I would just push it away. Eventually after two semesters of my GPA being under 2.0 I was academically dismissed. Even AFTER my last two semesters being on the deans list my GPA was still so low because I was not getting into the classes I needed to retake because I didn’t have enough credits to register early. So then I would have to choose a different class to take instead of the ones I was getting F’s in, I wasn’t getting those F’s off my transcripts since I wasn’t retaking them, and so even with a 3.6 and 3.7 GPA in my last two semesters before dismissal, it was not enough to bring my gpa above the threshold. I appealed the first semester I made deans list and it worked, and when the same thing happened again I figured they would let me appeal again since I was ONLY doing better, but nope, I was done and they let me know they wouldn’t consider any sort of academic forgiveness for 7 years. 

I tried applying to other state colleges but a significant amount would not take me with an academic dismissal on my record. My best bet was to go to community college and start over, get an associates with the credits transferred from undergrad, and then get into a guaranteed admission program with my community college. 

I was on this path but over the past year or so I have decided to put more effort into my business that I started and it is really taking off, I am doing well financially right now but I was getting the associates in business so that I could start a business. Now that I’ve started one I haven’t been prioritizing school since it literally does not make me any money and it's hard to find the motivation to get a business degree after I've already owned and operated my own business for two
years now. I started not registering for classes to take time off 'temporarily' but I really, really do not want to go back for business anymore.

I have learned through life experience and therapy for my ADHD that my brain in particular works best and is most successful ONLY when I am passionate and excited about things, and it’s so physically impossible for me to keep my head down and grind for something I have zero interest in. I’ve been thinking about this a lot and ever since I was a kid I was always an extremely passionate person about justice, social progress, politics, etc. I’ve always loved discussions on politics and law in general and I have always wanted to go to school for political science. My political science gen ed class my freshman year was the only class I never ever missed. I know I would love to do it and I know I would actually be good at it. I have been sitting down and talking with my therapist, family, and fiancé about how I want my future to
go and what my life goals are and honestly I always keep coming back to law. I really really want to be a judge and try to be the actual change for systemic injustices. I love to listen, I love to argue, I love to research, I know I would be good at this, and this is the most dedicated I have felt to a specific career in my lifetime. 

I want to go back to undergrad, get my degree, go to law school and practice law until I eventually work my way up to becoming a judge. It sounds like a lot and no one believes I can do it given my track record, but it’s so hard to explain I was sort of forced in a situation I did not want to be in, and I know I could have done better had I been able to figure out what I wanted to do on my own and followed my own personal passion instead of the one my parents wanted for me. 

I know this was a long preface but I would really like to know if anyone has gone on a similar path and how they were successful in doing so. I am being told it’s literally impossible, no one in my family believes for a second I can do it, and they refuse to support any of it since I failed out last time. It’s really okay though because I have since moved out on my own and have savings to be able to pay for school on my own. I just need to do it, but it’s now 100% on my own terms. 

What kind of steps did you take to get back into school and ensure you graduated this time? I am not opposed at all to going and doing all my education online, I actually much prefer it. I care zero percent about the name or prestige of the school, I just want to get my bachelors and go to law school, I don’t care how or where, I just want the degree and title. Any advice or encouragement? Thanks all 💓

83,snapper3071,1651995691,/r/college/comments/ukwqte/feeling_really_disappointed_with_my_performance/,"I will likely end up with around a cumulative 2.9 at the end of this semester and I feel like I've just screwed up my future. I'm a non premed bio major, but I hope to one day get a Phd so I'm still really motivated and want to achieve so much in life. However, even if I were to get all 4.0s from now on (which I won't if I'm going to be honest), I will end up with a gpa around 3.5, which will still not get me into grad school and I will likely not be finding any stable jobs in the future. So safe to say, I'm really worried. 

I had a really hard time adjusting to being oos at a huge state school that I have zero clue how I got into and genuinely don't believe I belong in anymore. (TW) I also really struggled heavily with my mental health and came close to wanting to take the easy way out twice last semester. Being relatively smart was really the only thing I had going for me in life, so when that piece of my identity was taken away, I just felt really empty. I genuinely felt like there was zero point to it all. I tried so hard and go so little in return. It got really tough at the end of each semester when everyone and their moms were yelling about their 4.0s and paid internships and I couldn't cheer about really anything. It sucked. 

Also, not only did I skip out on getting good grades, I also skipped out on making friends and joining orgs. I now wish I had that support system or retreat space more than ever. I might be more mad at myself for that than anything else tbh. I've never felt more alone even though I'm surrounded by 40,000 people.

84,Beginning_Rutabaga74,1651943277,/r/college/comments/ukhpou/my_professor_plagiarized_his_entire_course/,"Hi everyone. I just completed my final semester of my undergraduate degree! Woo! Unfortunately however it didn't get finished without some complications. I discovered that my professor for an elective course I was taking plagiarized \*all\* (every single word) of his lectures word for word primarily from Wikipedia but also from academic sources. He didn't include any citations/references and there is no mention anywhere that he is ""borrowing"" other peoples works nor did he verbally communicate this. Further, his lecture notes are massive paragraphs of text (from wikipedia) that contain WAY too much information. This was the most content heavy course I have ever taken. I studied a full 7 days for the final exam and didnt even scratch the surface of the courses content. He was too lazy to make his own notes and just copy/pasted entire Wikipedia articles into a PPT. So unfair for us students to have to study this much plagiarized material. 

In addition to this, he was a very rude and condescending man. I can handle negative and rude people but he was on another level. The feedback he left me on assignments was disgustingly mean, emails from him were usually less than a full sentence, and he basically just didn't care about his students or our wellbeing. 

He is surely a very smart man. He is old and has a well established career, he is well known within his field and led many big projects. I have no doubt about his intelligence or knowledge however this doesn't give him permission to be arrogant, rude, condescending or to be able to plagiarize from Wikipedia and other academics because he is too lazy to make his own lecture notes. Especially when us students suffer from the amount of content he throws at us, its not fair.

He is also an extremely difficult grader and removes grades for things that are irrelevant to the courses material/subject which feels very unfair. As well, he gives bare minimum instructions for assignments with no form of rubric or other objective grading scheme. For context, I usually get primarily A's in my courses and a couple B's here and there. I finished this course with a D+.

Now, the reason I am so frustrated is because I am applying to graduate school and I now have to somehow explain to graduate schools why I received a D+ in this course! I am very worried that this grade will effect my chances of being accepted and I have worked far too hard over my four years to not get accepted somewhere.

I emailed the dean informing them of this situation and was told that the professor will be subject to a ""process"" which is confidential. I helped provide examples of plagiarism for the dean as required for this ""process"". This ""process"" was not explained to me at all even though I asked for details and I feel I have been left in the dark. One of my concerns is that because so much of the course was copy and pasted from Wikipedia, I question the legitimacy of the credit that I have ""earned"". I have always been told that we are not allowed to use Wikipedia because anyone can go on there and edit the information to something false/inaccurate. So, basically I studied content which may not even be correct and ultimately the credit could be based on false information which is plagiarized. I feel like the school has tried to sweep this under the rug and down play the implications of this situation. And there are for sure large implications here. For myself, I may not be accepted to graduate school. Or, if the credit is deemed not legitimate I cant graduate on time or apply to grad school at all. He teaches 4-5 classes and I would assume they're all plagiarized - that's a lot of credits to revoke from a lot of students. This guy is a big academic, it would be detrimental to his reputation and career to be caught plagiarizing like this. And ultimately for the school this would tarnish their reputation because the school is responsible for checking in with their profs and ensuring this stuff never even happens in the first place. 

I do not know what to do. My friends family member is a famous, well known journalist who has offered to take this story to the public. But I feel that, for right now at least, that is a drastic measure.

Any tips, recommendations, or advice to navigate this situation?",college,My professor plagiarized his entire course :/,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ukhpou/my_professor_plagiarized_his_entire_course/,1651961277.0
85,QuietLock9863,1651888952,/r/college/comments/uk31pk/last_semester_of_junior_year_was_my_worst_what_do/,"Hi, I just finished the last semester of my junior year of college and really messed up. To preface, I have always gotten A's and B's, my GPA is a 3.60, and I usually am very good in school. Even last semester I was able to finish with all A's and one B. But this semester was just awful. The worst of my entire academic career. 

I took on a new job at a restaurant that required me to work both Friday and Saturday night, and on top of that, I worked an on campus job during the week... I think this is partly to blame for my lack of work ethic and falling behind. Serving is a really time consuming and an exhausting job-- I'd get home would only be able to sleep and lay around. Anyways, I found myself just being completely burnt out by Sunday (when I would plan to do my school work) and slowly started to fall behind... which snowballed into this. I also took about 16 credit hours and just felt towards the end that I couldn't do it anymore. At the beginning of the Spring semester I started taking anti-depressants, which caused me to be even more tired, and also got a proper ADHD diagnosis. I have just been trying a lot of different medications and its really messed with me. Basically, its been really mentally exhausting and my grades definitely show that.  

I received my first ever D and C. I tried to talk to my profs about my struggles and most felt it was too late, which I couldn't disagree with. I guess im here to ask what I should do? I can't retake the course I go a D in because the prof isn't offering it next year and im set to graduate then. I am trying to stay calm but I feel like everything I've worked so hard for has just crumbled in front of my eyes. Even worse that it was done by own doing. 

I am trying to get an incomplete in a course but they haven't answered and I am basically out of time. Im not expecting much. If I can make up the classes I will, but I guess I am most worried about grad school. I had dreams of applying to competitive schools for publishing, but now I feel like that's not an option. I know it could be worse, but this is so unlike me and what does it say to grad schools if I flunked in the last years of college? Also making them up and having the grade change granted won't be done in time since you apply pretty early for grad school.

86,Akward-Paintbrush,1651828758,/r/college/comments/ujjfuq/seriously_i_need_some_help/,"My head is like one step away from exploding. This year, I finally made it to art school, and I was the happiest I've ever been. Compared to the rest of the newbies, I lacked experience in drawing and painting but art is literally my means to communicate with the world (I am autistic so using words to communicate has never been my strong point) so I worked twice as hard as them in the workshops in order to evolve. The thing is, I constantly feel as if my tutors underestimate be, or don't even believe in me at all. They have made me reconsider my studies time and time again, and I cannot understand what else they might expect from me.
1. Even though I  turn in twice the essays, paintings, etc as the rest of the students, it is never recognized. They always want me to correct something or do more, while the rest of the students slip past with the bare minimum.
2. I am always in class working my ass off, while most of the others skip classes. When they finally come, they are praised as gods for even showing up or doing half their work, whilst I am always berated for even the tiniest mistake.
3. No matter what I do, it is never enough. I mean, I already turn in twice as much work as the rest, what else do they expect?  Inhave evolved so much, reaching the level of the others within months, despite.my lack of experience, but they always have some nasty comments to make for my work, while the others could make the same mistakes and just let them fly under the radar. Even my grades are in some cases lower than those of others, who are on the same level as I am.
4. I am am constantly asked to try more. WHY ONLY ME? I work so hard I miss sleep and socializing, I am at my wit's end.
5. Sometimes, the attacks get personal. They keep asking me to ""not be a wet blancket"", not ""be so mediocre"", not be ""rushy, shy, silent, weak"". BTW these are all symptoms of my condition (autism+adhd and possible dyspraxia, dyscalculia and selective mutism). I tried telling them that showing work in class and being told off before the entire class in twice as painful t me but they won't listen. I have to try twice as hard for some things as the rest of.my classmates, and it has become exhausting.
This has got way too much. Call me petty, but I need someone to tell me whenever I do a good job. Being constantly criticized has tore me down. I mean, I want my teachers to be strict and they are strict to the point of nasty tonpretty much everyone, this is the only way to get better, but I just don't get why I am never praised while the others are petted on the head head constantly, even if they make the same.mistajes as I do. This happens to every discipline (etc paintinting, video art etc) so I have started to come.to the conclusion that it is my fault this is happening. Maybe I should just drop out. No matter what I do, I will never be good enough for the art world. Yesterday my mentors made me cry in front of the whole class claiming that ""it was necessary for me to grow"".

88,UpAHillToTheRight,1651645936,/r/college/comments/ui0cxy/roommate_issues_is_it_common_not_to_talk_to_your/,"A brief backstory: My first semester at my brand new university (I was a 1st-year Junior when I moved to my first dorm) I had a quad-style dorm with 3 other roommates. 2 fizzled out, and I was left with just 1 for a bit. 3 days before the semester starts, we randomly get a 3rd, and we all felt like we clicked right away. Things were good for about 2 weeks, and then the 3rd me and the one roommate were not getting along. I feel like I have an opinionated, yet reasonable personality, but she had a opinionated and non-reasonable personality, so we just were kind of clashing a lot. That 3rd week she got very aggressive with me (I do think drugs/alcohol were involved) and I decided it best for me to just switch rooms. After the room switch, I noticed she posted some nasty stuff about me on social media (just messy, fake stuff trying to incite more things) so I got an order of no contact against her and obviously blocked her promptly after I moved out. This order prevented both her and I from ever directly talking to eachother on socials, tagging, etc., as well as in real life. Also, we were not allowed to talk through 3rd parties like mutual friends.

After this, I got placed in a room with 2 other girls who were friends and roomed before. They knew each other well, partied together, were heavily involved with frats/sororities, etc. and I don't think either was super serious about school since they seemed to party 3 days a week, every week, skipped classes frequently, etc. This is not an issue for me though, nor was it ever, although I am (and was at the time) 21+ and they did ask me to buy alcohol for them, to which I refused, and they seemed a little annoyed. It never felt like there was problems between us, although they did act a little distant, sort of ignore me and not really include me with their plans, etc. I understand they aren't obligated to invite me, so I never really counted it against myself, however obviously it would've been cooler if they would have included me. Again, I didn't really care about this too much as I usually don't party/go out every week and only feel like doing it occasionally. This being said, I did offer to take them with me  shopping and made an effort to include them or try and help them out since I did understand that they didn't have cars with them or means of getting to the stores they may have wanted to. I just tried to be pleasant all around. (Please also note, I wasn't trying to be weird and asking ""can I come with u guys"" all the time. For the most part, I only asked once or twice and they said that things prohibited me from coming to the parties, which I felt was kind of a lie, so I never really asked again.)

Flash forward to one day, immediately after getting pretty drunk at a bar with friends, I come back late and leave my washcloth hanging off the shower caddy and clearly made a mess on the counter from getting ready for bed. I know this is gross and annoying, but being drunk is sort of my excuse in this case. I had an event to go to at 5 am the next morning, so by the time I woke up and got dressed, I'm out before I even remember to clean up the counter. I obviously got a text later that said that my roommates needed to talk to me. (Also, before anyone addresses it, I totally get it that we all pay expensive rates to live in a dorm, and I should not be subjecting them to my messes. I totally get that, however it was, over the course of all but 3 weeks in 2 semesters, only once and I made a very clear effort to never do it again. It was just a busy night, busy morning, and it was cleaned up in less than 24 hours.) Nonetheless, I swallowed my pride and prepared to allow my roommates to say whatever they wanted to me, and not say anything back really, even though I did, deep down a bit, feel like they had their own set of issues I would address at a totally different time. (They both ate my food pretty consistently, helped not only themselves but their guests to my drinks, some alcoholic ones included, to which I just promptly stopped buying eventually after I realized, and they did leave some of their own messes occasionally as well, to which I'll get into later). The talk never happened, which I was actually sort of bummed over because I did want to apologize for it, and all of our busy schedules sort of never allowed it to really be discussed again in the future. I never felt like held hard feelings or grudges, it was sort of forgotten and we all still remained relatively pleasant.  

Flash forward to next semester, the roommate who originally asked me to talk ends up moving out due to some unrelated problems. For about 3 weeks into this semester, I live with the other roommate who recently acquired a bf. She proceeds to leave trash around the apartment pretty much daily, never changed her trash can (that was actually mine that I let her use, obviously) which eventually acquired an odor from the feminine products in it, and she and her bf even left used condoms laying around some places too. I almost didn't want to say anything to her because I'm quite sure her bf was the one responsible, but I was really getting to my wits end with her and her boyfriend closer to that 3 week mark. She eventually tells me her best friend upstairs had a bedroom open that she was moving into, so I would inevitably live alone in my 3 bedroom dorm ( was totally cool with it btw). Also please note, the semester prior, with that other roommate, I did inquire about something she was doing which resulted in her snapping very aggressively at me, threatening me, trying to incite a physical altercation, etc., so that's why I was very apprehensive about bringing up an issue with this roommate. Like, I'd just been through a lot and wasn't really prepared to deal with the fallout yet again. 

Now, the issue comes in now with the aftermath. Obviously I blocked and deleted the aggressive roommate from all social media, but I did notice that slowly I lost contact with all other roommates. One deleted me from social media (not upset, just curious), another one I'm pretty sure blocked me months after she eventually moved out (also not upset, just sort of interesting), and the one who moved out last sort of never really talks to me and we just kind of avoid eachother now. 

I get with the circumstances that happened why some might have chosen to delete me, but I'm just confused as to why really? I don't feel like I did anything that warranted being blocked, but then again I don't really know what happened. She could have deleted all social media, I just don't know. I get roommates don't always stay in contact, but I really don't feel like I've deserved to have been avoided like this? I wouldn't say I'm hard to live with or anything, I try to be positive and bright, but for some reason roommates and I have never seemed to click... Is this common for any of you? Also, if there's any tips or reasonable critique, I'm happy to take it. :) I just am struggling with my mistakes and it's sort of making me feel bad even though I tried my best to fix all of them.

I need some real help and I'm breaking down here trying to figure it out. I've written this much because the problem could be anywhere in here and I want the best advice I can get.

To preface, I was a high performer in high school (Class of 2020). By no means was I a particularly good student, but I was a high performer, and I've read tons and tons at this point on the issues that are associated with that/being labeled ""gifted""/etc. I never really had to apply a ton of study skills in high school therefore and never really had the chance to learn them. I was both smart and decently privileged, so anywhere that my smarts couldn't make up for the study skills, a tutor or my mom was there to catch me. I pretty much nailed high school with the exception of like one B in Senior year after COVID hit. Graduated with honors, wasn't valedictorian but that was fine, the kid who got it really deserved it.

In the summer leading up to college, I got accepted to my dream school, which was awesome, but a lot of family issues resulted from it. Toxic father who was abusive as both a parent and a spouse who insisted to pay for college for the sake of status, but also refused to pay for any school unless I landed ridiculous amounts of scholarship money... you know how it goes. Eventually we managed to get him to pay for my dream school, since I didn't get in on any scholarship and our blessed situation financially didn't really award any financial aid. I promise this becomes important later, just stick with me here.

Of course, because this was the summer of 2020, this is when COVID really changed the college scene and my school offered the option to go online, so naturally this is what I did since my whole family was really COVID-conscious. Fall semester comes around... and given how I started this, you're probably expecting me to say this is where I flopped, but truthfully, I actually NAILED first year. I even managed to develop all the work ethic and good study habits, along with having a thriving social life while at home! All As in primarily important pre-med stem classes with an extra elective I wanted to take. Only got an A- in the lab Gen Chem lab. I had the option to take Spring semester remote as well, so I did that.

At this point, a huge family crisis hit where we finally just hit the peak of the bs my father was putting my mother, sister, and I through, and he filed for a divorce behind my mom's back after she suggested they could file together. This became an incredibly stressful situation on top of being ostracized from an online friend group I'd been in for a year and a breakup with my girlfriend of three year at the time. My coping mechanisms weren't the greatest, but I trudged through the semester and did alright. Somewhat lighter course load, in all fairness, but all As and A-s, with one B+ from Gen Chem (which would have been an A if I didn't botch the final), so that's still incredible performance. In all fairness, I also made a lot of excuses in my lighter, less-serious classes that allowed me extensions on certain assignments and such, but that's still incredible performance and I'm not afraid to flaunt that. Ended freshman year on a 3.8/9 (depending on how you round it) GPA. However, due to the panic at the time, my mom really was panicked about that B+ in Gen Chem, so we decided it would be a good idea to get Organic out of the way ASAP, so I took it during the summer.

That was hell, but I came out with a B-, but my mom and I, being so used to how I was performing in high school, felt it wouldn't be a bad idea to just take it again during the school year since I've already seen the material once now and can just nail it next time, while also taking Bio and some other lighter classes (that would fit my now major, Psychology). It also was a huge hit to my confidence and momentum, alongside what I perceived to now be another huge pressure I needed to compensate for when I got to school in the Fall.

**Here's the juicy part. Sophomore year**

The divorce situation between my parents boiled on for the entirety of that winter semester, through the summer and fall semester, and finally ended during the Spring break of this past Spring 2022 semester. It only became worse and worse, and with my moving out, I wasn't able to handle it well at all, especially since on the big move-out day (remember I was remote that entire first year), my father trounced all over it by calling in his moving crew to move out to his apartment the same day.

My coping mechanisms with the whole ordeal were awful, and I had also recently rekindled my relationship with the girl who broke up with me during Spring 2021 (we found out a lot of our issues were based on gaslit misunderstandings from some 'friends' we had who hated what we had going on... we're healthier and happier than ever with each other now). So I was spending a lot of time with her over the phone trying to cope. At first, things still felt exciting and fresh and new. I renovated my room from the worst building on campus into something *AMAZING* (not to brag). My first couple weeks I was studying hard and good, but it all just started to catch up with me.

My work ethic just vanished. All that change I'd made and resilience I had to the family situation and other problems in freshman year just vanished. I was breaking down, I was skipping classes (which I had never done even *once* up until this point), and was doing so pretty unapologetically. I was suddenly having intense trouble grasping material well enough to do anything on exams, even when I felt just as confident as I would in freshman year before exams that I *aced*. I tried talking to on-campus counselors and therapists and they were nice but it just wasn't helping. I took courses from the Student Wellness Center to see what I might be missing, but I just couldn't do it.

I knew and know what I have to do but I just can't do it. I know I need to put in the work, but I've stopped studying diligently and regularly too. That whole first semester I didn't really even have close friends on campus aside from my roommate, because I became a shut-in, but in the last two weeks of Fall 2021 I managed to find some really nice people who I'm now close friends with. I even start making the walk to classes, then just sitting outside the classroom or building. It's right there. It's just another 50 footsteps away, but I don't go in. My confidence kept taking more and more hits as I'd mess up even incredibly easy classes. Fall 2021 ended with one A in a basically gimme-A class, a B-, and all Cs.

It's only during Spring 2022 when I managed to fix my issues of attendance and start actually getting up in the mornings consistently and going to classes and not just staying outside, and even now, my grades are technically doing even worse. I ended up with a midterm deficiency for my absences in one of my classes. I used standing witness in my parents' trial to skip out on some midterms whose credit have been shifted onto my upcoming finals. I don't want to be a bad student or a bad person but I really just feel like I somehow randomly am now. I really want to do well. I just can't find the drive, focus, or motivation to do any of what I need to do now. My semester is yet again looking like it's going to finish out on Bs and Cs, which, while not the worst thing ever, is certainly not gonna cut it for med schools.

I've made it this far, and even got myself together during my freshman year of college. I managed to overcome that typical gifted-kid burnout slump or whatever it is. I overcame my lack of study skills, time, management, and social awkwardness I had in high school. Then I move out to college after doing the first year remote with a few unnecessary hits to my self-confidence over things that really weren't big problems in hindsight, a bunch of extra problems on my back, and no ways to properly cope that are genuinely helping me.

*The interesting part of the issue here is not the same thing about high-performing high school students doing bad in college*. *It's about actually getting myself together after high school, nailing freshman year and not even feeling too burnt out, making one mistake (that I blew way out of proportion) at a bad time when everything else in my life comes crashing down, and now it's all gone.*

I keep feeling remotivated to try and try again but then two days after I get that motivation burst I just fall back into it all. I'm so tired and don't know what to do. I can't find anything on even remotely similar situations, but there has to be someone out there, right? Please. Someone help me. I'm so tired and scared. I'm not gonna make any huge life-altering or ending decisions so please don't worry about that. But just, please. Someone help me. I don't know what to do.

91,SaleSubstantial9962,1651011186,/r/college/comments/uco793/i_truly_regret_going_to_college_straight_away/,"There. I said it. I wish I took the time to figure out what I wanted to do in life instead of blindly chasing a career I figured I wanted over what I truly been thinking about. So for those of you who don't know, I love reading books and have been over the years. But this year I kind of feel short and lost motivation.



What does this do with college you may ask? I wanted to be a city librarian, since I loved reading books, I figured this career would suit me but I was wrong. I missed out on gaining valuable work experience and money that would have been necessary to save up and get a head-start in life. 



I think working at 15-years-old while sporting through school would have done me wonders, pursuing my actually intellect and dreams. I've been a huge fan of entertainment and being apart of that has always been exciting. I have constant dreams of it and can't stop. It's like an addictive drug. I use to see dramas and fun acting events at school and felt amazed at how great the performances were.


I have social anxiety and feel stunted somewhat physically, emotionally and mentally because of my broken past, terrible people and crappy environment. I figured now that since I withdrew from my spring courses, I work full-time, get my license, if I could, then just work my way up into living the low-budget minimalist life-style for a few years, until I am able to pick up work and auditions. 


So my plan is to save up over $100,000 dollars and live a relatively small way, making sure all of my needs are taken care of so I can get into a good acting school and earn a Theater Degree for a wonderful future of getting into acting and being the source of excitement and entertainment. 



Thinking about it just makes me happy and I can't imagine living this shitty life of working 40+ hours a week, for over 40 years with less than 40% of my life to lives. I have only a single life and want to go out with a huge bang. So I am not sure if I want to continue. I tried taking a Theater 101 class, but realize I can't attend the rest of the courses as they are in person and I live far away because I moved in with my mother, who wants me to leave her house as she sees me as a burden. 


I am trying to get my life together and it's hard, but I hope in my future if I make it, that it would have been worth it. I heard stories of celebrities that had hard lives near my age until they started acting and I want to know what you guys think of my story.

I’m constantly miserable, I have no passion for any major or clubs/activities, and the self-motivation that is required to do well is something I can’t force myself to have. None of my classes require attendance, so it’s on me to lug my depressed self out of bed every morning when I’d rather be sleeping until 5am. The weather in this town is bleak, cold, and depressing, only exacerbating my SAD.

I told myself I’d go to an Ivy League school because I got in and it’d make my future as bright as possible. It’s just been so hard and absolutely not fun at all. I even joined a sorority to try and get the “typical” college experience and I just don’t care for frat parties or any of that BS.

Just getting myself out of bed or in the shower is such a momentous task…I just don’t know how I can continue like this for another three years. I’ve tried years of therapy, medication, etc and I’ve reached a point of diminishing returns.

I always did well in HS, so I thought I couldn’t be one of those people who just isn’t “meant for college”. Plus, I have zero clue what I’d be doing if I weren’t in college.

For the first year I did very well with difficult courses, after having never taken an HS AP or Honors course, then came the Pandemic. Over the last year and a half, from the combined weight of a personal emergency and a pandemic, I've seen my GPA slip lower and lower. I still refuse to give up, constantly recognizing that NOBODY who grew up like me goes to college, let alone a really good university. I try/have tried my absolute hardest in every class, but I'm realizing that it's to little avail. It looks like I'll have a bad transcript after graduation.

My question is, was it for nought? I spent about two years working on just getting into this university and getting this degree, but poor grades are poor grades. I was hoping to one day go to graduate school, hell, maybe even Law School.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I don't mean to be fishing for sympathetic answers, so I'll rephrase: Is there anything I can do immediately post-university to compensate for bad grades? And does getting those bad grades, in the eyes of grad-schools/company hiring teams basically cancel out the fact that I went to a good school?

94,LostOnceAgain13,1650289923,/r/college/comments/u6do3t/pessimistic_about_my_major_and_looking_for_next/,"The story: I'm finishing up my second year of college and I'm trying to decide whether to keep my major. I went into my first year planning to be an economics major and so spent my first year studying that. I hated it, was bored to death, and after some more research found I wasn't looking forward to doing any of the careers I scanned through. My second year, I switched to international studies. I love the courses, have a plan to go abroad and get a couple internships before graduating, pick up a minor in a hard skill like economics, computer science, or technical writing, do some supplemental business coursework, ideally get more involved in student groups/around campus, and potentially volunteer straight out of school through something like the AmeriCorps or the Peace Corps, with the end goal of going into business. I know the obvious question is why didn't I just go into business but I'll get to that. IS is not a super marketable major, I went into it knowing this but I thought well I have a plan so it'll be fine.

However, as you all know from the title, I'm starting to doubt that plan. To the point that I've considered doing a complete turn and switching to computer science almost purely for marketability. I find tech to be interesting, particularly the privacy and security aspects of it but I tried coding one summer during high school and got bored/didn't enjoy it. Looking back, I wish I had at least taken one course my first year so I would've been pushed to stick with it and see if it was just that I was learning and would rather read my new book or whatever rather than struggle through coding over summer vacation, but, I thought economics was the major for me and there's nothing I can do to change that now. My school is also limited in tech majors and they're pretty math focused so that didn't really push me to analyze my choices either. I've never been interested in sciences like biology, chemistry, physics, etc. and math tends to really stress me out so tech was the only sector of STEM that had a chance. Medicine is simply not an option as I don't do well with blood, injuries, etc.. High school grad me had some hangups about going to business school and, again, I was set on economics so I never seriously considered more concrete business majors. Then a year ago I was so thrilled to be in a major course that wasn't economics and was actually interesting that I think I got a little too optimistic about job opportunities.

Also at this point I'm kind of stuck. My school doesn't have just a general business degree and for almost all the business field degrees I would have to go to school for an additional year which is an option but not an ideal one. The ones that I could fit in are more loosely related like communications and linguistics and I feel like those are about as marketable as global studies. STEM degrees are largely in the same boat with the added negative that I want nothing to do with almost all of them though I found one computer science program which I mentioned earlier. I love my school so I don't want to transfer and I keep coming back to how I have a plan but again, I'm starting to feel like it won't be enough.

A lot of people say study what you love but I know that coursework doesn't always reflect what your job will be like. I'm willing to sacrifice a little passion for job security.

So I have two questions, the first is just simply, do I need to abandon ship and switch majors (whether to business, CS, or a different liberal arts degree) now when it's only potentially an extra year? And the second, whether you think I should switch or not, what do you recommend for next steps?",college,Pessimistic about my major and looking for next steps,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/u6do3t/pessimistic_about_my_major_and_looking_for_next/,1650307923.0
95,kikichris789,1650190938,/r/college/comments/u5k9jc/academic_dishonesty_issue/,"Ok, so this is a really long story, but I'll try to keep it short. PM me, if you have a similar experience or you would like to give some advice about my situation.

Last semester I had a final exam for a math course, the final exam is supposed to be in-person, but during that period, I thought I might have Covid and I requested a makeup exam, which was online. The online exam was set up with two devices(a computer to access the exam and a tablet/phone to access the exam zoom meeting so the staff can proctor the exam).

Instructions for the exam:

* need around 12 papers
* write solutions on one side only
* exam check out
* after check out, we have 10 mins to submit the papers by using some file app to turn them into a pdf. And we can't make any alterations once we leave the meeting. Anything after 10 mins will not be accepted.

So I used 12 papers on the exam and start writing on one side of my papers(this is more like where I do the steps to draft my initial solutions and to test if my work was correct or not, and I'll call this side as my ""Scratch side""). I also used the other side of the paper to present my final solutions in a more organized manner(I'll call this my ""Solution side"").

Towards the end of the exam, I felt flustered because I was still physically unwell and I was rushing to organize my solutions onto the ""Solution side"". I organized my answers roughly on the ""Solution side"" because I understood that my answers were supposed to be presented on one side of the paper. Afterward, I compiled 10 photos of my solutions, one page each for 10 total questions on the exam, into a single pdf and successfully submitted it to the proctor within the time limit. The 10 photos I sent were the ""Solution side"". I also took pictures of 6 ""Scratch sides"" (which contained work I felt was also important). Although the ""Scratch side"" contained relevant work, I sacrificed sending them in to comply with exam instructions because I was mostly preoccupied with scanning my pages to hand in my exam on time. To be explicit, I used 2 out of my 12 papers as scrap paper, and the other 10 papers for problem-solving.

The next day in the morning, I was thinking about what I wrote on the exam and my submission to the proctor. I was simultaneously relieved and frustrated. I was relieved because I still had the 6 ""Scratch side"" of important work saved on my phone, but I was frustrated because I felt that I should have sent them in. I was mostly disappointed in the fact that when I was hurrying to finish and submit my exam, I had initially overlooked how important these 6 ""Scratch sides"" were to my solutions. At the time of the exam’s end, I felt that it was reasonable for me not to send those pages in because it was stated that I should only submit one side of our papers. I did not think it could hurt to attempt submitting my 6 ""Scratch side"" to the proctor. Because I care about the quality of my submissions, I wanted to offer my professor a more complete record of my work by sending these pages.

A few days after the exam, I was notified by my professor that a possible academic dishonesty issue was detected during my final. So I had a meeting with him during the beginning of my winter break. During the meeting, he basically asked Why I sent those 6 ""Scratch sides"" afterward? He asked kindly and politely. I just answered his question honestly. After that meeting, it was terrible and scary, and I had a horrible winter break; I literally spent my whole winter break freaking out and waiting for the result.

At the end of my winter break, I was notified by my professor that I was responsible for this. I got a charge and a sanction of a zero on the final. I was very upset and distressed when I got this result. Also, I've been doing really well in that class before I took the final; I completed every single assignment and achieved nearly perfect scores on both of my midterms for that math course, which were given IN-PERSON. And for my other courses, I got A's. Given that I have a proven record of a strong academic background, the act of me committing a violation of academic integrity seems out of character. As a student who was already performing well prior to the final, I had no incentives to cheat on the final exam.

I tried to schedule another meeting with the professor to explain things more in-depth. However, he said that there's no need for it since the meeting I had with him already served as an opportunity for me to explain. And he told me that if I'm not happy about it, I should just appeal. So, I appealed. The appeal process in our school is really restricted. We are only allowed to appeal by writing a letter to the academic integrity office. It depends on the preponderance of evidence to see if there's a need for a hearing. There's literally nothing I can provide to prove myself; the only evidence I have are time stamps. So I wrote a letter with in-depth explanations of what happened and attached the timestamps of the 6 ""Scratch sides"" in the letter, but they straight out denied my letter and said that timestamps can be altered, and notified me that my case was closed and did not give me another opportunity to appeal. The director of the academic integrity office said the preponderance of the evidence is on the professor because it's clear that I have no indication of my 6 ""scratch sides"" in the video and photos evidence. So I asked for documents that the professor provided. He basically provided the submission of my 10 ""Solution sides"" and said that the other side of my work is not visible and, provided a photo of me piling up my 12 papers in the exam meeting, said that the backside of my last paper is blank(They thought that's my page 10 for problem-solving, but that's my scrap papers). Which I felt, they didn't read my appeal letter carefully. After that, every time I tries to contact them, the only thing they told me is to complete an assignment to clear my record. I felt that they think it's totally fine for a student to move on since they get a chance to clear the record, it might be some case for some students, but I don't think it's okay for me.

At that time, I felt very desperate and even had some suicidal thoughts, but luckily my parents kept encouraging me. I didn't know it could cause this much trouble by just sending a file of work, and in the instruction, it literally stated that anything after 10 mins won't be accepted. I had a conversation with my parents to hire a student defense attorney to deal with this. My parents spent a lot of money to hire an attorney to get involved, but this attorney only tries to do their best at the school level/system and does not cover a lawsuit. After the attorney gets involved, the office of academic integrity said that is a relatively small violation, and I do have an opportunity to complete an assignment to clear my record(the sanction still applies). I was planning to transfer after my first semester, and this crap hits me hard.

What should be my next step? Should I just move forward? Or should I keep fighting and go for a lawsuit? Since this is really time-consuming and costs a lot of money.

Always putting other people's needs above my own, always wanting the best for the group. But I wasn't prepared for college, and I always had a negative approach to it, because I was terrified. 

I picked my major on a whim, and ended up liking it so much I pulled off a stellar GPA. I studied hard. I grew, I became more independent, I learned to prioritize, manage my time and care for myself. 

But that first week of college shaped the entire experience so to speak. I hated my first week of college, and would legit cry (I'm a 21M). I wanted out. SO BAD. I eventually accepted my fate and settled in.

I realized that it was all up to me, and I took it to a whole new level where all I cared about was myself. ***And now, in my last year, all I care about is myself.*** I took a girl out to dinner a few years ago, and she asks ""Aren't you gonna share some?"" she then proceeds to give me some of her food, which I thought was very sweet. I tried returning the favor, but she declined. Sharing never occurred to me.

I still feel bad thinking about that day. I don't think about other people. All I care about is myself and getting my own way. It's all about me. I never used to be like this. Yes, I'm more mature, grown up and all that, but at what cost?

I had a programming course in high school and before getting into it I always found the idea of being able to program apps and things interesting. Since I was in 7th grade, I tried learning it but I was very misled because when our teachers showed us what programming was in 7th grade, they showed us with games and funny patterns. So I kept doing that on my free time (in my mind then, I thought that was what programmers did, I knew it was harder tho) until I eventually got bored and stopped. Next thing I know I took a serious programming class in high school. Idk why but I thought by the end of the year/ course I will be a great programmer or I'd find it enjoyable. I admit I found it fun in the begning but it was not sunshine and rainbows as I thought in 7th grade. Some functions were so hard to comprehend at first like ""def"". Especially when we added math to it, it was hard but tbh I felt good after applying a math formula I learned in math class to my project but it was so hard to learn it. When programming my last project at the end of the course I basically had to get a lot of help from people/ stackoverflow and I even copied from youtube and other online sources. Although I learned it and knew what I was doing, I wasn't proud of my accomplishment.

---

This is my second semester in college.

I've enrolled in this remote Composition II class for the Winter semester. Last semester, I took a remote class of a different subject, and I struggled to complete my assignments on time, but I grinded what I could near the end of the semester and scraped by good enough for me. I felt ready to take the lessons I learned from that course and use them to do better at a new remote course. I wanted to take this specific class since 1) it had the same professor as my Composition I course, and 2) I was super bored taking Composition I as a Zoom class (just realizing that I have a lot of problems with focus and attention, but that is not for this post...). I didn't want to take an in-person class since the campus is far away (working on transferring to a school closer to where I live).

Anyway, Winter semester is chugging along, and my mental health is taking a nosedive. Anxiety is making is hard to attend my classes, get studying done, and go to work at my job when I'm scheduled. I'm doing the bare minimum in three of my classes, but this online course had fallen by the wayside. I've tried almost everything in my ~study skills toolbox~ to get back on top of it (except reaching out to academic advising, which is silly of me...), including cutting my hours at work, but every week goes by and I'm overwhelmed to begin on all my late assignments. I do a couple here and there, and upon checking my grades, I'm receiving less than half credit for them being late and not being my best work.

It has taken me until now, the second to last month of this semester, to reach out to my school's counseling services. I plan on taking a break from school for at least the Summer semester, maybe Fall as well, to focus on therapy instead. 

But I still have to get through this last month of Winter. There is no way for me to speedrun this class *and* pass. I met with an academic advisor this morning, and he suggested I try asking my professor to submit a Withdraw for me so I don't have to have a failing grade on my transcript. It's possible to me to retake this class, but the grade won't be replaced. All it will do is give me credit for the course and improve my GPA. But I don't care so much about my GPA at this school since I'm transferring my credits soon anyway.

**TL;DR:** I signed up for an online course with full intent to do the work, but mental illness had other plans and I ended up being unable to complete anything consistently. I want to ask my professor for a W for their course so my transcript doesn't have an F for an essential class, but I don't know if that's appropriate given my circumstances. I also am lost on how to write the email. How should I go about asking for this?? Is it worth it?

102,Neopint15,1649320051,/r/college/comments/ty8f72/how_should_i_approach_my_professor_about_this/,"Hello everyone, 

First off, I apologize for the lengthy post. I felt it necessary to give background on this issue. I really really appreciate everyone who reads it and gives me advice on the matter. Please skip to the bottom, if you don’t want to read it all though! 

This semester at my college, I signed up for a experiential learning opportunity, where we are placed in a practicum and then connect that experience back into the class teachings (I learned about this afterwards). Before the semester started, we were sent various options by the coordinator, who was supposed to take a look at our transcripts and interests. I was very clear that mine were still science related, but the coordinator continuously suggested a marketing position. After a while if talking, she sent me a few research opportunities, which I liked. Unfortunately, the interviews available were only during my final exam times… the coordinator said that they were also doing interviews the first week of January. However, in January, she informed me that my research interests were taken and again suggested that I interview for the marketing position at least to see what it is about. Pressed for options and wanting to take part in the experience, I agreed. 

I have a background in science, but for reasons unrelated to this post, I went back to school last year under a business degree (the university would not allow me to take another degree similar to science). My main interests were to get some business related experience, while also learning more about research (so I continued to take science courses in between my business courses). However, I have only ever taken one introductory marketing course as it was not my focus. 

After the interview, I again expressed to the coordinator my concerns about my very limited knowledge in marketing. I was assured that there would be a “ton of support” and that I would have a lot of help along the way. She also said it was very similar to research. Given guidance, I felt I’d be okay; however, I came to find out that the “guidance” was non-existent and the help was on the basis of myself reaching out to various professionals at the university - most who were too busy to meet. I was unable to meet with anyone until the middle of February (1.5/3 months into my project) and they were not a marketing professional but did give me insight on the business. My project mentor also had no clue about marketing and was difficult to meet. Everything was also remote and I was the only one in the class with a business type practicum (everyone else had researcher type positions), so I found it to be a very isolating and stressful experience. 

Due to these limitations, I have found myself aimless about my project objectives and slow to progress. I also found it extremely difficult to draw back to my learnings since I hadn’t much of a background into marketing. I feel I have done very little in my project compared to my peers. We are not marked on our project itself, but we are marked on our reflections about the project. 

As I draft up my final reflection, I am realizing that my project progress did not reflect the course’s materials (based on the concept of “community”) very well. I worry that my professor will think I am incompetent and lazy, despite me having lost a ton of sleep and time over trying to navigate this project with limited resources. I worry this may reflect my mark. 

I have dropped hints about my limited knowledge, in the past. My professor knows that I have only an introductory marketing class, but she doesn’t know the conditions of why I accepted the offer despite it. I feel the fact that I was expecting support and didn’t get it is why I have not been able to thoroughly make connections in the class and have been behind. 

Should I email her and respectfully explain my circumstances more thoroughly? I don’t want to sound like I’m whining, but this course has quite frankly, taken me three times as long as it should have due to all my trouble shooting and I’ll be absolutely hurt if I end up getting a bad mark despite my efforts in an adverse situation. 

I was thinking of sending Something like:

 “I was hesitant to bring this up, but after writing my final reflection, I thought it may be best too… while I learned a lot in this role, I quite honestly do not feel it was the best fit for me due to my limited knowledge in marketing. I was initially hesitant to take the role due to this but was assured there would be lots of support; however, the support took much longer to reach out too and was far more limited than I had expected. I felt I really struggled drawing connections and moving forward in my project because of this, although I really gave it my best efforts. It has been an extremely educational opportunity and I have learned a lot; however, I feel my reflection(s) have not been able to go in depth because I do not have the background knowledge to fully understand my role as a marketing strategist”

I’m almost done with the school year but I’m having a really hard time seeing myself being here for the next three years. I’m not happy where I am. I mostly went to this college because it was the “best” college I got into (the other were lower-tier state schools while my college is a pretty decent private school). I haven’t had that many good moments. I haven’t made any real friends that I consider myself close to. Right before I left for Winter Break, I called the suicide hotline and cried to them that I didn’t connect with anyone at my school despite trying. I also go to therapy regularly at my school and towards the end of the semester, I went a LOT more. I’ve cried more times than I can count within the last year. I also was hospitalized for suicide ideation a week ago and when I saw my academic advisor yesterday, I broke down crying in front of her.

I also had a really terrible roommate that destroyed a lot of my happiness, so that definitely made things worse.

I'm from California but go to college in Georgia. I unestimated how much time, money, and energy it takes to fly and travel across the entire country. If I actually enjoyed my college, I could definitely see how flying across the country is worth it. 

I don’t really enjoy my classes despite taking the classes that I’m the most interested in. In September I thought I wanted to transfer and talked to my counselor about it. I earned a 3.4 GPA (one A-, three B+) which is much better than my 2.9 in high school. However, I'm not sure if I want to transfer anymore, because there's a part of me that thinks college isn't for me. I honestly doubt I'll be any happier at another school. I’m the President of the freshman class and I’m involved in blog writing as well as an acapella group, so I definitely tried to get involved in my school.

105,panquequita,1648873744,/r/college/comments/tuafae/i_might_not_graduate_college_on_time_and_miss_out/,"I'm a senior and failing a course I need to graduate definitely living the dream! I'm insanely busy, I'm taking 17 credits including as a TA, work 20+ hrs a week with shitty hospital hours (can't lower commitment bc i need the insurance), vice pres of a sorority, have ADHD and recently had to stop meds for bipolar because of an adverse reaction, so not doing too hot mentally. I'm literally so busy I think being hungry is annoying and a waste of time which is sad because I love food :(

I asked my prof for help to get a passing grade (we still have a month left, so it's not a hail mary). I put in as much time as I can for the class and I understand all the material, but her quizzes suck and are inconsistent. I tried explaining my situation not as an excuse but to explain that it's not that I'm not trying, but that I just have a lot going on and if I could just get some help so I can graduate on time I would appreciate it.

Instead, she said ""that sucks"" and its my problem, not hers, and I'm probably bad at time management (reread schedule - don't think I could have bad time management and get through my week) and implied I'm just probably overall a bad student (said ""well most students that come to me in this class about their grades are failing other classes, so you have to learn to prioritize those Fs over Bs"". I have an A or B in all my other classes and made the Dean's List past semesters in my higher level classes... I'm not an incompetent student). Basically told me that I just have to try harder and that I probably don't put work into this class when I spend hours studying. I literally was crying and she said ""oh yeah that does suck, but it's your fault for taking this on. maybe you should have thought about that before it was too late."" So, I switched up and asked for direct help. I told her I can't reach office hours because of my schedule and she refused a personal 1:1 meeting (I caught her at the end of an office hours to have this conversation). I asked if she can post extra practice material that I know exists and is student made from previous classes and was posted for the first 2 quizzes, she just has to post the dropbox link, and she said no. She pulls some questions from those and makes a study sheet, so I asked if she could at least post an answer key for the study questions so I knew if I was doing things right... she said no. I was at a loss because I guess she assumed I was just a bad, lazy student just whining about their grade, but when I asked for any kind of reasonable help, she also refused. At this point, she just repeated that I probably have bad study habits and need to ""change something or I will keep getting the same grades"", with no suggestions, no advice, not even a half-assed direction to school tutors. All I have are her lectures, a practice quiz/study guide with no answer key, and short assignment questions that barely help prep for the quizzes.

I talked to my advisor because I was just accepted into a pretty selective biomedical masters program (they only accept 35 students) that starts in June, so I NEED to graduate in May (I also heard back right after meeting with the prof and I didn't even celebrate because I was so upset. She literally ruined my acceptance to my dream grad program) I was upfront with my advisor and was honest about not  doing EC assignments (in total, the assignments for the semester add up to an extra 1/160 points aka 0.6% of my grade and I'd rather be able to eat or sleep for once) or why I don't attend in-person lecture (ADHD - I have specific ways I have to take notes when watching lectures to make sure I understand and absorb material, and she posts live recorded lectures and I benefit more from those, and attendance isn't taken anyways) and he said that I had reasonable answers and that it was nothing that made me a lesser student or not trying hard enough, and that her answers against helping me were ridiculous. He told me a good option is to take it to the dean so I'm thinking of doing that next week, but a part of me feels like I'm acting like an entitled senior that needs to be granted an undeserved grade to graduate, even though that isn't the case. I'm willing to work for the grade and don't expect it to be handed to me but the professor won't even help me figure out how, just used it as an opportunity to insult me as a student and my abilities with no prior knowledge of me. Basically I don't really know what to do if I don't graduate on time and I'm just freaking out and needed to get it out lol

TL;DR: My weeks are 90% work/class/extracurricular and 10% basic necessities of being alive and I'm about as burnt out as a puffbar you just found behind the couch cushions. I need to pass this class to graduate and go to my masters program on time and spend hours studying, but when I asked my professor for help she suggested I'm just not trying hard enough and am just an incompetent student and refused any sort of help I asked for. I'm now panicking and want to fetal position cry or maybe even go out and celebrate my acceptance to my dream grad program but I can't do either because my professor suggested that maybe if I quit my job lose my insurance left my sorority and forget about all my other classes I might find what I'm looking for!

107,perpetually_unsynced,1648795807,/r/college/comments/ttkg5b/us_federal_student_aid_tips_sap/,"*…from a random internet invalid that just so happens to do this for a living.*

Preface: I just got done writing this as a comment to someone on r/financialaid, and figured it could potentially be useful to some folks over in these parts, as Federal Student Aid (FSA) logistics can be complex and bothersome. I hope that 1) I’m not breaking any sub rules by posting this and 2) some folks here find this info helpful. **This is a specific topic for students in the U.S.** However, hundreds of thousands lose their eligibility every year due to SAP, and it’s a commonly misunderstood requirement that takes a lot of people by surprise when they lose their money. 

*Source — I’ve been working within an accredited university’s financial aid team for several years, both back-end and front-facing, and have these conversations with students dozens of times daily. I also borrowed dozens of thousands in private loans, and want to prevent as many people as I can from making the same mistake, because f*ck Sallie Mae. P.S. Federal loan interest is historically much lower than private, just so ya know.* 

**What is SAP?**
SAP (Satisfactory Academic Progress) is a federal requirement in receiving Federal Student Aid (most commonly including Pell Grant &amp; Federal Direct Loans) as outlined by the U.S. Dept. of Education. Introduced as part of the Higher Education Act of 1965 [20 USC 1091(c)], SAP specifically establishes GPA and program completion requirements that need satisfied in U.S. post-secondary institutions to maintain FSA eligibility. These requirements can change based on credits completed, grade level, and diploma type/level. 

**How to Craft a Winning Appeal**
With a SAP appeal, you want to be as specific as is comfortable for you with the information provided. Specifically, the appeal team will typically look for 4 primary things when reviewing your submitted appeal:

**1. Extenuating Circumstances:** This is an intentionally vague phrase, just so you know, as it can obviously vary greatly for every student. Circumstances are generally outlined with a PSS (personal signed statement). I recommend clearly illustrating how the circumstances directly (or even indirectly) impacted your ability to make academic progress during the F/W period (I’ll touch on this more further down). This can include physical/mental illness, a loss of a family member, COVID-19, etc. If not meeting SAP, I wholly recommend completing an appeal **even if you doubt** your circumstances are a good enough reason for a poor GPA or rate of completion. You’ll never know whether or not it will go in your favor until a decision is finalized — guaranteed. I still get surprised all the time. 

**2. Third-Party Supporting Documentation:** This can also vary greatly depending on the scenarios explained in your statement. It can include bills, death/birth certificates, a letter from a doctor, documents related to work (pay-stub, time-card, letter from a boss, etc.), and so on. Generally, you want to provide documentation that includes the following elements:

     - A Non-editable Format: This is one of the biggest reasons I see for a denial of an appeal or a request for additional documents. **An unlocked PDF or Word Doc sent from the student’s email address, for example, is typically seen as an editable document.** It can be easily manipulated through It’s respective software. **An official doctor’s letter with an ink signature and letterhead**, however, would not be editable, nor would any of the above listed supporting documents, generally-speaking, that is. 

     - Hand-signatures &amp; Dates: Self-explanatory. All signatures generally need to be in physical ink. On everything. Forever. BUT, some institutions are temporarily allowing electronic signatures due to the pandemic (***never** typed font signatures though*). Keep in mind that anything except a genuine ink signature could also make for an editable document, depending on the school’s guidelines, which, as a reminder, is a no-no. 

     - Official &amp; Verifiable Third Parties: Keep in my mind also that your institution’s Financial Aid Dept. will very likely attempt to verify third parties, and any counterfeit or forged documents can almost certainly result in expulsion or being kicked out permanently. Third parties could include a health practitioner, a manager/leader of your company, a funeral home, and a shit-ton of others. Any well-respected community professional, perhaps, or pretty much anyone with a pHD that provided you health-related services. A priest or other clergy member is a hard-‘sometimes-but-not-usually.’ A family member and friend would not, in fact, fall within this category. *Unless your friend died. Then, you can use their death certificate. Thanks friend.* If you have any doubts, give your school a call to confirm if a document can be used. 

     - Official Letterhead OR Seal OR Stamp: The appeal team may not always insist on any or all of these, but it certainly wouldn’t hurt your case. It would also almost certainly have your school designate the chosen document as non-editable, which is definitely a win because they can get really nit-picky about editable shit. Get it if you can. 

**3. The F/W Period:** The F/W is going to be a period of time during your attendance, in which you were actively enrolled in and **failed or withdrew from** courses (hence ‘F/W’). Yes, withdrawals can hurt SAP as well, often as much as failed courses. I’d recommend referring closely to your Academic Plan and ensuring all terms/semesters that have failed and withdrawn courses over the last two or so years on your grades list are discussed within your SAP appeal. Ensure you concretely connect the components of your extenuating circumstances in the appeal statement directly to the given periods in question. *This is another very common reason for denial.* It also wouldn’t hurt to call your school’s Financial Aid Team to straight up ask what your F/W periods are. 

**4. Improvement of Circumstances:** This is another one of those primary things students overlook or forget to include within their appeals, thus resulting in unnecessary denials. Essentially, both you and your institution (the responsibility also falls on them, fyi) need to clearly illustrate that the aforementioned circumstances have cleared up or improved enough so that you can now continue making progress with your FSA-eligible program, specifically (say it with me) *satisfactory academic progress* 🌝. This could, for example, be a brief statement included in your doctor’s letter that explains how and why you are able to, now that the dumb, inconvenient stuff regarding your deteriorating health and wellness has since gone away forever and that you’re now medically classified as a superhuman, continue to perform well academically. A doctor’s letter is super useful for these appeals — Depending on the situation, it can often check off all the boxes for the entire appeal in one neat little package. **Secret tip: If your appeal is pertaining to being overworked, you can submit a time-card with manageable work hours, or a letter from your boss saying they have pity-released you from slavery. If the appeal is financial-based, you can show increased wages on a w2 form or pay-stub. If it’s child-related, go ahead and simply mail the child to your institution’s office. Please allow 3-5 business days for review. Results may very.** 

**Finally, what does it mean to not ‘meet SAP?’** 

There are two factors associated with the federal SAP requirement: *Quantitative* and *Qualitative.* I’d recommend giving your Financial Aid Dept a call and requesting clarification on which of these two requirements you are not meeting. **Quantitative SAP** is the number of credit hours you have attempted versus the number you’ve successfully completed, generally indicated on your student account as percentages. **Qualitative SAP** is simply your overall GPA, *always* indicated as a decimal (*duh*). I’d also recommend asking what your specific SAP requirements are in these two categories, as they can change based on grade level, degree type, etc. Generally, I see the typical requirements for the students I’ve encountered in this process to be a 2.0 GPA with a 50-60% completion rate. Undergraduate students with 12 credits or less typically need to have a 50% program completion rate and a 1.5 GPA. Make sure to get this information, so that you can cater the contents of your appeal accordingly, depending on what’s not being met. 

Also, one more big thing — keep a close eye on deadlines. At my university, we have a firm Thursday of start week deadline. It’s likely yours will also have a strict date in place. Just so you know, we can’t deviate from that date. It’s a federal requirement and we’ve already extended it as much as we possibly can without being sub-compliant. If a school loses its FSA privileges (yes, schools have to apply to receive FSA, and many are denied annually) due to a blatant disregard for federal law, so do it’s students. 😌

That about sums it up. Apologies if I was too long-winded here. Tried to be as concise and reader-friendly as possible, but there are a lot of complexities regarding FSA. *A lot.* Let me know if y’all have any questions!",college,[U.S.] Federal Student Aid Tips: SAP,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ttkg5b/us_federal_student_aid_tips_sap/,1648813807.0

I'm from an Asian country called Bangladesh. A person interacting with another person is generally so common back in my country. I guess you know, Asia is indeed known for its friendliness and stuff. So you kinda get what I was used to. I was used to talking to all the students back in my high school and stuff. Even if I didn't know him/her. I've had like so many people whom I could talk to back there.
Before coming here,  I've met several American Freshmen on Instagram and they all seemed so chilly (still is). After seeing all these, my hopes were like so up and I thought it wouldn't be a problem to make friends.

But it's been a disaster. I've tried everything to make friends back in my college but there has been no luck. I do seat with some specific person in college but they seem to be interested in talking only INSIDE THE CLASSROOM. It always ends with ""see you on Friday/Wednesday but never 'let's hang out together"". What hurts more is that I have to initiate everything. I have initiate the conversation, carry it, find topics, give them interesting facts so that they find the conversation unique, etc. I'm getting tired of doing anything. Nowadays I'm feeling like let's just STFU and just stop trying. What scares me most is that day by day I'm getting sucked up into nothingness. I know it's my fault. But I'm not feeling like going out or anything. I wasn't like this before I came here. I'm feeling like the surrounding energy is showing its effect. Though I was warned by my uncle who lives in Maryland before entering the USA that people don't like someone joining ""their business"" here. But I didn't take it seriously back then.

I know I don't have the right to comment on a culture's way of work, but I've seen countless posts here which also showcase the problem of ""why making friends is so hard in this city"" from Americans themselves. The posts gave me the courage to write this out and I'm in no way being judgemental because I believe I don't have the right. I'm just asking a simple question ""why do you think it's so hard making friends? In this country? If you agree it is hard making friends here, what can I do to right now to solve this problem?",college,Why Is It So Hard Making Friends HERE in the USA?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tpfskz/why_is_it_so_hard_making_friends_here_in_the_usa/,1648388243.0

111,hakunahmatatahhh,1648155920,/r/college/comments/tn4r5q/sixth_form_or_college/,"For a bit of backstory:

I am 17, F, and have dealt with anxiety and depression almost my entire life. I tried going to college this past September and it went terribly so now I'm working at home. I hate this too and can't learn anything. And now Im debating going back to college or going to a sixth form for this September and starting the year again... Please help/advise me on what you guys think is the best option!

&amp;#x200B;

The college is in the middle of the city. 10,000+ students and it is huge. You have to walk to separate buildings that are all over the city for different lessons within 5-10 minutes. A lootttt of walking and moving around. It is also incredibly crowded. Its a city of course, with an addition to the 10,000 students scrambling about. Last September I found this incredibly hard to deal with, given my anxiety. I also would have to get the train every day, twice. It is only a 15-20 minute journey on train but once again, anxiety!

The sixth form is in a tiny school, with about 200 sixth form students. It consists of just 1 building within school grounds and is just very compact and straight forward. I went there for a look around and thought the school was shut due to how quiet it was. However, my mum would have to drive me there everyday, and I'd have to stay there the entirety of the day regardless of if I have a free timetable. You can't walk anywhere interesting from it, nor is there a train line or bus line. So I'd be completely abandoned there until someone is available to pick me up. This scares me as I fear I may need to leave (panic attack etc) and wont be able to. Whereas with the college, a train is very frequent or I can leave and go into a library in the city or wherever. My boyfriend is at uni in the city too so I could go and see him in my frees or if I need a safe place to go. 

The sixth form seems like an obvious good choice. But I was thinking... going to the college will help me. Pushing myself to go on a train everyday, then go into a bustling city, then go into a college filled with people. I made a metaphor to my friend which I thought was good: Going to the college feels like I'm going up 5 steps, sixth form feels like I'm going up 1. The problem is, I dont know how steep the steps are. But the more steps I climb, the stronger my legs will get and it will make it easier climbing future steps. (steps being problems to overcome, the legs getting stronger being my ability to cope with mental health). 

I just don't know if it will be too much. This past September I only lasted a month or so. I couldn't leave the car. But since then, I have been going out much more. I have a boyfriend who lives in the city so I've become more familiar with it. Last year, I was going from staying at home everyday, sometimes scared to even go downstairs, to suddenly being in this huge city. So it seems obvious looking back how it would end up... But anyway, I have no idea what to do for this coming September. I understand it is a while away but I like to plan and know what I'm doing and prep. 

What are your guys' thoughts? I forgot to mention, the college offers a loootttt more courses, ones that I am interested in. Whereas the small sixth form just do the basic choices and nothing special.",college,Sixth form or College...?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tn4r5q/sixth_form_or_college/,1648173920.0

Just to give a summary: I have been extremely hard on myself lately for having such a hard time making noticeable change in my practicum. I’m upset it is taking 90% of my time, when it should take much less. Lack of direction and structure has only made this worse, as I spend so much time trying to figure out what The correct thing is to do in my practicum and the class associated to it. 

These past 2 years, I have been really pushing myself academically. A few weeks before Christmas break, I received an email about a new class this term incorporating experimental learning. I jumped at the opportunity since research was one of the things I’d been striving to get some hands on experience in. The coordinator continuously tried to get me to take a marketing position (probably due to me getting an A+ in the one intro marketing course I took), but I emphasized that I felt more comfortable doing research (as I have a more thorough science background to fall back on). Unfortunately, my academic and work schedule (during final exams) did not line up with the first round of interviews, so I was told that others would also be interviewing early January over break. A few days before Jan, I was told my top picks were already chosen. The coordinator told me that I should interview for the marketing practicum anyways to find out more info. I did and was immediately concerned I didn’t have enough knowledge for the remote opportunity. The coordinator reassured me that there would be plenty of support and I’d be fine. 

Well, as it turns out, there really wasn’t any set support. I found myself at a loss without further marketing knowledge and spent 90% of my time trying to read up on what I was SUPPOSED to do, only to come up empty handed and more confused. The nonprofit organization I was set up with had no set guidelines and didn’t provide me with any information beyond they wanted to attract more donations. They were also difficult to contact and again, everything was remote. After feeling completely lost, trying to solve things myself. I eventually contacted the professor and expressed my worries. The prof reached out to the schools marketing team and donor relations. The marketing team replied they were too busy to meet and the donor relations didn’t reply until half way through the semester (late last month). 

The thing is that I HATE not being able to succeed and make a sizeable difference for my nonprofit organization. They absolutely think I am a marketing major (I am not! But was told it is fine if I had interest). For the past 3 months, I’ve found myself increasingly stressed out trying to make some difference. I’ve spent 90% of my time allocating everything to this practicum, despite having 4 other classes I need to succeed in (trying for med school). I perpetually behind on my other class work because of that. Yet I also have a class with other materials attached to the practicum, where I am supposed to reflect on my “project” and how my previous studies help me navigate the project (You think I would have been told this when they literally looked at my transcript?!). Furthermore, I am the ONLY person NOT doing a specific research project compared to everyone else. I was given very little direction and things like “you can help edit a powerpoint”. Competitive analysis, swot were all things I did with external information, which doesn’t help much. This all makes my projects within the class (that we are marked on) VERY difficult and time consuming. I practically have to BS my way through them. 

Anyways, to give you all the run down, I am very burnt out and yet, I feel very angry with myself for not being able to figure this out better and sooner. I have learned a lot through the experience, but I’m not sure it is what the professor “wants” me to learn.  At this point, I am just terrified of what mark I might get, not because of lack of effort, but because I just don’t have the background knowledge to perform at the level expected!",college,Am I being too hard on Myself?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tjp2b6/am_i_being_too_hard_on_myself/,1647923045.0
113,VietUS1999,1647671556,/r/college/comments/thpbo9/i_graduated_from_college_with_nothing/,"I just graduated last year in December and I've been super despondent with post-grad life. Growing up, I experienced many instances of racism and othering due to being Asian, so I grew up feeling like an outsider even though I've lived in my hometown for 21 years.  Ever since I was 11, I dreamt and strived to get into a good college because I wanted to be out of my hometown and in an environment where I actually belonged. I know that college is supposed to be for academics, but I wanted my experience to be more well-rounded. I didn't have the best upbringing, so I was hoping that college would make up for it all. 

My first two years of college sucked. I didn't get to go to the university I wanted to go to and ended up having to go to a school my parents picked and that I had very little interest in attending. Whatever little self-confidence I had went down the drain those first 2 years. I felt isolated from everyone and everywhere I went. I felt like everyone around me just spent time talking shit on me, using me, and rejecting me. In every club, I felt like a loser, and every frat I tried to join whether it was academic or social just made me feel rejected. I felt like a second-class citizen and wondered why did my life have to suck so bad?

I stayed strong enough to transfer in Fall 2019 and even though my new university was better environment-wise than my old one, I still didn't have a real experience. Covid happened and so I only spent 5 months on my new campus during my 3rd year and did online school until my last quarter year of college. My grades got a lot better during online school from March 2020 to Sept 2021, but I spent most of it having mental depressive breakdowns because I felt like the universe was just shitting on me at every turn. 

My last quarter of college was actually my best even though I was sad about graduating with very little experience. I lived with 8 guys that quarter and collectively they were a lot nicer than my previous roommates. They actually invited me to hang out and we spent a lot of time together talking and playing video games.  But, a part of me felt sad because I knew I was only going to be with them for 3 months before graduating. I also felt insecure with the relationship between us because I wasn't sure if they would like me or even bother to hang out with me if I wasn't their roommate. Plus, some of them gave me a lot of shit for being a virgin at 22 at the time. They didn't get why I hadn't met someone, but it's hard to consider having sex when you feel like people don't even want to sit near you. 

Anyway since graduation I've been in a rut emotionally. I'm still living with my parents in the town that I hated living in growing up. The job market here is not the greatest, so I plan on going back for my Associates in Sonography because I find it interesting and I want to be able to make enough money to move out in 2-3 years. I only have one friend here but I don't see myself really making more in the future. Because frankly If I couldn't fit in during what was supposed to be the most social and best years of my life then what chance do I have out in the real Adult world where people are more closed off because they have other responsibilities to deal with. 

T.L; D.R: Came into college as an ugly loser with big hopes for a better social experience and left as an ugly loser with a degree.

Hello, I wanted to write and ask anyone for help or advice with my academics. Recently I’ve been struggling more then usual with my academics. Throughout high school and even my earlier years, I’ve never really had to study for my classes. I took most of the AP’s at my high school and always got A’s and B’s with minimal/light effort. However, for the first time I truly feel stuck. I was able to get by last semester (freshman year of college) with mostly B’s and one C, but midway through the second semester I’m genuinely lost. I’ve tried “studying” but since I’ve never really had to before it’s hard for me to define what that is. For me, I’d start by writing down what I need to get done before I go to the library so I don’t get sidetracked, then I’d begin with my first topic, say, chemistry. I’d start by reviewing last classes notes, then watching videos on the topic to fill in any holes, then I’d pull up my profs practice problems. I’d start off alright and then I’d get stuck, check the solution and say it was just a dumb mistake and move on. By then end of the study session (~2 hours per class) I feel confident enough to be done (go to the gym, relax, etc). But it is NOT working. This entire semester it’s been nothing but C’s after C’s and to some people that’s probably all they are aiming for but at this rate I’m going to end this semester with a cumulative 3.0, barely. 

Does anyone have ANY advice for how to study for the following courses

- chemistry (colligative properties, order reactions, ice boxes, ice boxes using salts, weak acids, weak bases, etc.)

- biology (plant structure, ecosystems, energy flow, etc.)

- psychology (human development, behavioral psychology, evolutionary psychology, etc.)

Lastly, is there anyone who has gone through something similar? I feel like there’s no way to come back from this year and that my gpa is already too far gone. Is there anyone who has personally gone through something similar and still gonna on to graduate/professional school?

Fall 2021 I arrived at my dream school. Throughout high school I had like 2 friends and my home life was not good, so I was excited for college because I thought I could finally have fun instead of pretending everything's okay. 

Fast forward I'm at the exact same place I was when I first came here. At least I had those 2 friends in HS to spend time with regularly. I've tried so hard to make friends, attending clubs every day of the week, asking an embarrassing amount of people to hang out with me, I even went up to a random girl who was wearing a shirt with my favorite band on it and started talking to her and asked her to hang out too (don't judge me ok I was desperate). The only 'friends' I've made are study buddies and they don't reply to me when I ask to hang out outside of studying.

I've tried really hard and now I'm exhausted. I feel like giving up in my efforts to make friends, because I'm just a backup option for most people. My elder sister tells me to enjoy college, because after this it's just gonna go downhill. Well I hope she's wrong, because I just have nowhere to go anymore. I'm lonely here, and I'm even lonelier when I go back home. I know I shouldn't give up and I can't just wait for my life to start, but that seems like the only other option.",college,Friends wya,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tex3jv/friends_wya/,1647389134.0

First semester of senior year I caught covid and I missed three weeks of school continuously and then almost one to two days a week since.This was because I got hit hard and suffered from symptoms that never quite went away. 

Of course my grades dropped. I went from an all A’s student with the occasional B to getting 60s and 70s (the 60s were in AP classes so technically I passed since my school adds 10 points) I made one B last semester and one A. 

I wrote on the common App extra section that I was sick and how covid affected my grades and that even thought they were low I’m proud of where I’ve brought them up to since I worked really hard to get them from 20s and 30s to passing. I also kind of made it Into it’s own essay, not sure if I was supposed to do that. 

I know that colleges don’t mind less than perfect grades as long as upward progress can be seen and you are well rounded, But that’s why I’m worried since I’ve shown I decline in academics. 

Suppose that I am a well rounded and competitive student in every other aspect, will my grades from last semester be my down fall? And the reason, when comparing me to a similar application, I’m to be rejected.

My essays were strong in consideration of execution and content/grammar/writing, though the topic may be a common one.

120,Crock-A-Gator,1646198420,/r/college/comments/t4slq3/what_do_i_do_with_my_life/,"So, to start, I want to get some initial information out there. I graduated high school in 2019 at the age of 17. I am **M\\20**, now in my 6th semester of college as a ""junior"". But basically, where a freshman would be at. 

I feel like I have made so many mistakes when it has come to schooling. Too many to count. Highschool I never tried, didn't care, didn't study, and overall didn't do anything that wasn't required to do. And sometimes not even that. I didn't try to learn, for example, never tried in math at all (which will come up later), cheated on what schoolwork I was able to cheat on, and relied on everyone else to do the work for me. In fact, I think I did homework in high school a total of 5-10 times max. I specifically remember a PLTW class that I did not do a single thing the entire semester/year however long the class was. It was group-based, and I was paired with some good friends who were smart ash and tried hard in school (I will mention these two again later). All in all, I did not set myself up with a good work ethic or study habits. And I especially didn't set myself up with good grades to aid in college at all. Speaking of college, I had no idea what I wanted to do. Our school counselors in high school as well as my parents PUSHED me extremely hard to go into a community college because of the A+ program and how I could ""save SO MUCH money"", and just ""go into college with an associate degree and be right where you would have been anyways"". And to clear it up my dad did not go to college; my mom went and got a BSAD degree, and they were both extremely uninterested in helping me with anything to do in college. Or really with life. They were busy getting divorced and running a couple of separate businesses that didn’t do too hot for our family life. Which (at the time) was 100% okay with me because I just didn't want to worry about college and didn't care. They just seemed to let me figure it out myself which is still the case and has been the case for the last couple of years since I have been in college. Didn't talk about degrees, ideas, pros, and cons, universities, or literally anything at all with anything to do about college. I did all my financial aid alone, like figuring out payments, classes, tours of the school and anything else you could think of that goes into college. I think they just thought it was an easy way to go and ""saved money"" which was fine with them for some reason even though they aren't paying for any schooling. 

This brings me to my first transition going to college. My first semester was GREAT. Easy classes still didn't know what I wanted to do, just kind of riding the wave and commuting with a different group of friends from high school, and all ended up getting very close. Taking just normal general education classes like English, writing, math, college success class, and a computer applications class. I still cheated and hardly tried, did about as little as I could still. (I got caught plagiarizing in my writing class and my prof. pulled up the exact article I copied from in class and read it out loud coincidentally. When he saw my paper, he knew what I did. Anyways, some of those classes were a joke. I was fine with the grades I was getting even though some classes were 'pass/fail' and didn't count as any credits like 'pre-algebra' and 'developmental writing'. I didn't take any math I didn't HAVE to take in high school as I said earlier, and it fucked me because I had to take every single math class from the ground up at the most basic level starting at pre-algebra.

I feel like I am rambling on and on and on, so anyways I end up going for four more semesters (5 in total) at this same college and kind of doing the same thing honestly. It is embarrassing to say but I did, I cheated when I could, didn't study, and cared more but not as much as a successful college student should. This community college and airhead advisors had me taking every single general education under the sun I ended up with about 59 earned credits after 5 semesters. And by this time, I had decided I wanted to major in computer science. I thought because I like computers, video games, and technology this would be a great choice. Plus, some good friends (high school PLTW friends) were going into engineering, so STEM sounded great. I did not realize anything this entailed or how bad I fucked up in school and in that community college. The last math class I completed was college algebra and that was one of the classes during covid and I cheated 100% the entire thing. I tried to study but would get frustrated and just quit then cheat and get through it. Come to find out comp sci goes to calc three, plus stats, and discrete math. That was and is the least of my worries now though. 

**Also, an important note here** \- I feel like I focused a lot on the cheating aspect and unmotivated aspect. In all reality, it doesn't matter or feel like it matters that much I cheated on history and different classes like that. I didn't or don't need them in my degree and I could care less about it. I could wrap my head wasting so much time over learning about stuff that doesn't interest me and isn't going to help at all with anything. I am not trying to defend it. That was just my reasoning. Math obviously is a different story. Maybe I am wrong and that conditioned me to do things wrong, I wholeheartedly don’t know. 

Once I got to my 5th semester at that community college, I already knew I ""wanted"" to major in comp sci as I said. I didn't even get an associate degree in computer science or any kind for that matter after that last semester. But I didn't think it was going to be a big deal as I was told by friends and some other people it would really matter that much while transferring. The advisors did say it might be harder to transfer credits but after everything they made me do and how much I hated it at that community college, I didn't care what happened. Big mistake. And by this point in my life, I was looking down a direction and for the first-time kind of getting excited about knowing where I wanted to go and how I was going to get there no matter how hard it is with a degree in comp sci. Hopefully figuring out my life, doing something productive and meaningful. I was proud to say I am transferring to this university to study computer science. Then I was told by the university I was transferring to that almost none of my credits will be able to be transferred because of equivalency from course to course. At first, I was destroyed. They told me I basically have 4 years left and I am going to have to start from the beginning. 3 days after I heard that I was still just devastated, I thought those 2.5 years were wasted. But I switched advisors and my new advisor told me we can figure something out and see what is going on. Basically, I took WAY too many general education classes and not degree-specific classes at my community college, as well as not getting an associate degree so really nothing transferred or was equivalent to any courses. And for some reason, idiot me got my hopes up on our university's degree audit page and it says that I have 55 credits that have been transferred, 12 in progress, and 53 credits to go until I get a bachelor's degree. I have no idea why I didn't put this all in my head but those are just classes that did transfer over to the school but no matter what in any degree I run an audit on its all about 3 years minimum. So, I was going through all these emotions, from thinking I have 3 years, then to “alright I only have 2 years like I should”, to then again back to realizing I have even more time than I thought. 

So after, now this semester. I realized that I have close to 100 credits or about 3.5 years until I get any degree almost at all. Because hardly any classes from my community college transfer over as any sort of degree-specific requirements. I hate computer science I am sick of it; I can't do math(pre-calc) to save my life, I have terrible study habits, and can't seem to get motivated although I truly want to. I truly want to do better. I was just coasting through the community college. And although I was cheating, I felt like I was turning it around and getting smarter and doing better last 2 semesters ago and especially last semester, and was ready to come to a new school and try hard and make leeway on a degree. Now I failed both exams on the two most important classes I have, want to switch degrees, watching my friends from high school who tried and work hard (they happen to be my best friends) pass me up and go on and about to graduate with engineering degrees, while I am stuck basically at freshman-level courses I can’t pass. 

I just feel like a failure, I feel lost and so confused. I don't feel like I am smart enough for school, I don't feel like I have the study habits it takes, I don't even know if I want to go through with another 3-to 4 years of schooling.

Even after all this typing which is the longest post I have ever posted by far, I think I did a terrible job summing it up and explaining. In my mind, this feels like 5% of my thoughts. I talked down on myself about a lot of different things, I don't think I did everything wrong. I had an internship last summer for computer science, and another one this summer with a company that is supposed to be one of the ""top 100 internship programs in the country"". But all in all, I am so far behind in college it just kills me, I wish I did stuff differently, I wish I instilled a better work ethic and study habits when I was younger, I wish I had more support. I am trying to turn it around I just have no idea how at all. Everyone can make excuses about everything if they don't succeed, I don't want to seem like the type to complain about everything. I just feel like I did A LOT of stuff wrong ALOT of different times, as well as getting a couple of iffy hands in this confusing game of poker we call life :/

**I hope everyone reading this can truly smile, wake up and say with 100% honesty that they are happy. That is true success.** And I hope to be successful one day. I need to remember this too, **“everything will be okay”**.

So, to start, I want to get some initial information out there. I graduated high school in 2019 at the age of 17. I am **M\\20**, now in my 6th semester of college as a ""junior"". But basically, where a freshman would be at. 

I feel like I have made so many mistakes when it has come to schooling. Too many to count. Highschool I never tried, didn't care, didn't study, and overall didn't do anything that wasn't required to do. And sometimes not even that. I didn't try to learn, for example, never tried in math at all (which will come up later), cheated on what schoolwork I was able to cheat on, and relied on everyone else to do the work for me. In fact, I think I did homework in high school a total of 5-10 times max. I specifically remember a PLTW class that I did not do a single thing the entire semester/year however long the class was. It was group-based, and I was paired with some good friends who were smart ash and tried hard in school (I will mention these two again later). All in all, I did not set myself up with a good work ethic or study habits. And I especially didn't set myself up with good grades to aid in college at all. Speaking of college, I had no idea what I wanted to do. Our school counselors in high school as well as my parents PUSHED me extremely hard to go into a community college because of the A+ program and how I could ""save SO MUCH money"", and just ""go into college with an associate degree and be right where you would have been anyways"". And to clear it up my dad did not go to college; my mom went and got a BSAD degree, and they were both extremely uninterested in helping me with anything to do in college. Or really with life. They were busy getting divorced and running a couple separate businesses that didn’t do to hot for our family life. Which (at the time) was 100% okay with me because I just didn't want to worry about college and didn't care. They just seemed to let me figure it out myself which is still the case and has been the case for the last couple of years since I have been in college. Didn't talk about degrees, ideas, pros, and cons, universities, or literally anything at all with anything to do about college. I did all my financial aid alone, like figuring out payments, classes, tours of school and anything else you could think of that goes into college. I think they just thought it was an easy way to go and ""saved money"" which was fine with them for some reason even though they aren't paying for any schooling. 

This brings me to my first transition going to college. My first semester was GREAT. Easy classes still didn't know what I wanted to do, just kind of riding the wave and commuting with a different group of friends from high school, and all ended up getting very close. Taking just normal general education classes like English, writing, math, college success class, and a computer applications class. I still cheated and hardly tried, did about as little as I could still. (I got caught plagiarizing in my writing class and my prof. pulled up the exact article I copied from in class and read it out loud coincidentally. When he saw my paper, he knew what I did. Anyways, some of those classes were a joke. I was fine with the grades I was getting even though some classes were 'pass/fail' and didn't count as any credits like 'pre-algebra' and 'developmental writing'. I didn't take any math I didn't HAVE to take in high school as I said earlier, and it fucked me because I had to take every single math class from the ground up at the most basic level starting at pre-algebra.

I feel like I am rambling on and on and on, so anyways I end up going for four more semesters (5 in total) at this same college and kind of doing the same thing honestly. It is embarrassing to say but I did, I cheated when I could, didn't study, and cared more but not as much as a successful college student should. This community college and airhead advisors had me taking every single general education under the sun I ended up with about 59 earned credits after 5 semesters. And by this time, I had decided I wanted to major in computer science. I thought because I like computers, video games, and technology this would be a great choice. Plus, some good friends (high school PLTW friends) were going into engineering, so STEM sounded great. I did not realize anything this entailed or how bad I fucked up in school and in that community college. The last math class I completed was college algebra and that was one of the classes during covid and I cheated 100% the entire thing. I tried to study but would get frustrated and just quit then cheat and get through it. Come to find out comp sci goes to calc three, plus stats, and discrete math. That was and is the least of my worries now though.

This might be a long read but I appreciate anyway that could help me out; i’m losing hope. 

 I’m 19 turning on 20 here in a few months and in my second year of college. I committed to an out of state college and it was a decision I knew wasn’t going to work out. I pledged and joined a big fraternity that fall semester. Consequently, my grades dropped dramatically. Frat life wasn’t for me, i’m a former basketball player that turned down a lot of division 1 opportunities because I got burned out (these offers came in when I was 15/16). I had lost the love for the game, so I decided to go to college as a normal kid. I quickly found out that my quality of life was astronomically worse and everything I valued in my life was nonexistent. My grades dropped so hard I had to withdraw most of my classes, my bank account plummeted as I spent almost 1.5k on food, alcohol, nicotine, you name it; college shit. I’m usually a person that works out 2x a day and social stuff comes after those things, not the other way around. I returned home to take online classes for the spring semester.

Originally, coming home for the spring was just to temporally get my grades up enough so I could be eligible for events for my fraternity. it was embarrassing to me that I had left basketball, joined a frat, and couldn’t even make grades. However, my quality of life at home was so much better. I could work out everyday, and focus on school after classes. It was definitely lonely but much better than feeling stuck in a constant party where my daily routines were stripped of me. Despite things better, I still couldn’t keep my shit together in school and managed a C in Econ and B in college algebra. 

I decided to transfer to a community college in my area to take classes over the summer and catch up on math (I withdrew from math fall semester freshman year). I took math and accounting over the summer in 8 week-online classes, such a bad idea but I was desperate from being so disappointed in myself and behind my peers. Before the first exam I caught myself screwed in math after failing the first exam. I was forced to withdraw from math and decided to re-take it the next fall semester with in-person. I finished with a disappointing C in accounting. 

Also, I had requested a general petition to have my first semester (full of w’s and failed grades) completely removed from my transcript; which succeeded. So with that semester gone, I have my online semester after coming home, summer semester, and now this fall semester.

This fall I am taking an english class that I tried taking first semester of freshman year @ university that I withdrew from, macro economics, and re-taking math. I recently fell behind in english (I found it harder since it was all online) which i’m so fucking mad at myself for; I was forced to withdraw. Recently I had felt a little sick and skipped a few math classes, the last one I didn’t mean to miss. I fell behind a few weeks in homework but I mostly caught up today… because my exam is tomorrow. even with taking the class before, I still fucking slacked this much. This is the same exam I failed last time and I realized that even if I managed to get all the homework done, I would certainly fail the exam, along with having a bad homework grade (late work). I’m going to withdraw from the math class again, it hurts so much but i’m going to be failing.

I’m torn because I keep fucking failing myself. It also hurts so much more because i’m somebody that was essentially supposed to be the kid that played professionally. A lot of people look up to me and i’m essentially a bum now? I can’t fucking get good grades and I’m not a dumb kid at all. Almost all my peers believe i’m super smart but I just keep failing. 

what should I do? can I even transfer with those grades? is grad school out of hope?would joining the military at 20 help straighten me out? 

This is an idea i’ve thought about for years. The military gives me an opportunity to work hard like in sports and better myself everyday. I’ve always heavily considered it but never pulled the trigger because i’m scared of losing my freedom of BACKING OUT, which as you can see, is the story of my entire fucking life.

tldr: I’m and ex athlete that is failing college and has continuously withdrew from courses from bad grades. This is my second year of college and I had my first semester of year one waived from my transcript. I just withdrew from 2 classes I previously withdrew from. i’m letting myself down time and time again. i’m losing hope. I don’t know what to do.",college,I’m 20 and keep having to withdraw from classes due to bad grades.

on top of that, the quarter is coming to an end soon and that means classwork, projects, and exams are in full swing. i haven’t been doing great in my classes this quarter so this only makes it worse. i tried to do my homework last night but found i literally could not focus at all; it was like my brain was totally dead. 

i think before dating him i was a pretty independent person and didn’t open up much to people (have friends but i keep them at a safe distance) but with him i started being vulnerable and personal for the first time in a long time. now it’s so hard to go back to before where i didn’t talk to anyone about stuff on my mind, because i’ve gotten so used to him making me feel better about things on my mind. for example stress abt school - now i have to face it alone. 

also, i realized i spent so much time with him and now i don’t really have a solid friend group to do stuff with. i have a lot of friends at a distance who i hang out with once in a while but no one who i just would be like down to spend a whole day out with anytime. there’s a comfort i’ve never felt with anyone except him. now i feel suddenly lonely seeing friend groups around campus even though i didn’t feel lonely before. 

this is not even to mention clubs and other obligations that i can barely face right now. even eating is hard, all i want to do is sleep and cry. how do i get through all of my responsibilities when something like this happens? sorry for sounding naive and dramatic, i’ve just never experienced anything like this.",college,how to deal with breakup while managing classes and everything else,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/t3qzdm/how_to_deal_with_breakup_while_managing_classes/,1646103116.0
124,Speedster202,1645379133,/r/college/comments/sx6s02/small_group_of_students_screws_the_whole_class/,"I go to a college that requires students to take at least 2 semesters of a foreign language. I chose Spanish because I had already do some of it in high-school, meaning I came into the course with some basic understanding of the language. Many other students in the class did the same thing.

There is this group of students in the class who, for lack of a better term, refuse to care about the content. They never do the homework or ""forgot to bring it"", are always talking when the professor is teaching a lesson, etc. I could excuse the not having all the work done if there were pages of homework each night, but there aren't! Homework might be given once during the week, usually a worksheet or two, and then a worksheet over the weekend. None of the sheets are overly hard, mostly fill in the blanks, answer questions in Spanish, and translate some sentences.

We had a quiz on Friday consisting of vocab and grammar + conjugating verbs correctly. It is obvious who in the class studies and puts in the effort, and those who don't, based on going over homework in class and listening to people's answers. The professor has tried again and again to get everyone to understand the importance of studying, writing out the vocab terms multiple times to memorize them, and look over past examples of homework to understand the grammar and sentence structures.

He sent an email to the class last night, and needless to say, he *was not* happy with the quizzes. He said in the email ""SOME of you pay NO attention at all, because I SAID THAT THOSE STEM CHANGING VERBS (shoe shape) that we studied in the present, DO NOT have a stem change in the preterit, except if they are third conjugation verbs (-ir verbs).  THIS has been explained before, so go and study it."" It is obvious which group in the class this email was directed towards. (The all caps words are copied directly from the email, I didn't make the all caps)

In this email, he re-sent the quiz and told everyone ""this must be printed out, filled out, and translate the first section entirely to bring to class Monday."" He also said he wants to see the vocab terms copied and translated SIX times, just like he told us we should do a week before the quiz was given to ensure we knew the terms.

The professor is very caring about his students and is always willing to help &amp; answer questions, but this group of students has really broken him. They disrespect him in class and pay little attention, barely try on the homework, and I am assuming completely bombed the quiz.

I am currently going to school for a bachelor's degree and I'm about halfway through.  The option to transfer is also out the window because my program is specific to my college. I just don't see a point in socializing much anymore, unfortunately. I've really tried to meet people through similar interests, but when I went to the events hosted by the school, I was the only one who showed up. Or they simply do not exist during this pandemic. So, I don't know, I have started to pull away and doubt if the program is worth sticking around for due to my lack of social life. As a low-income student, I also have a hard time relating to a lot of my peers, so college so far has been a very alienating and discouraging experience. And unless things start to open up such as clubs, I don't see it getting any better. My grades are doing well, but I don't know if I can go through another two years feeling isolated from my peers.

I finished high school in the first half of 2020, half of my last semester was online when i foolishly through that the pandemic was going to end in a couple of weeks... But didnt.

I was supposed to move out to another state to start college in the second semester of 2020, but couldnt because all classes were online, I already had an apartment in the city so I tried to move in the first week of college and take my classes in there but i really got sad and truly depressed due to homesickness and being trapped in the apartment in a city i didnt know, it really was the worst week of my life, so I moved back to my city and took the rest of the semester there, the pandemic didnt finish so I also took my second semester online and I really got tired of it, i wasnt learning properly and felt more and more unmotivated.

My third semester was also not that good and I stopped excercising and taking care of myself, It wasnt that bad because I had my family, my gf and my hobbies but i really felt like I was stagnant in life, I wasnt learning good, i wasnt improving as a person and so on.

I started to get excited to move out again, half of my classes where on the actual classroom and i felt this as the change i needed, finally moving out, finally taking classes right and a chance to start to build everything for my future. 

My flight was saturday morning, my parents, my sister and my girlfriend were there, we said our goodbyes and I took the plane alone, i arrived to my destiny and made my way to my dorms... then it started to settle in, like that time in 2020 i started to feel sad and nostalgic altough not as bad as last time but still felt it. Spent the rest of saturday trying to get my head right and doing a couple of errands. Sunday was a little hard because it was a free day, school started til monday so i just wondered around my block and tried to eat. I started thinking how uncomftable everything was and how much i just wanted to stay home forever but I remembered how much i hated that so i feel confused about everything

127,SleepyLimey,1644803374,/r/college/comments/sryrsq/need_adviceguidance_for_transferring_and_picking/,"Hey everyone, I've been struggling a lot at my college (Arizona State) and I'm seriously considering transferring but I need some help and advice so I don't make the same mistakes I did that led me here. Also advice on how to move on from having such a miserable first year since I can't get over this feeling of regret.

TL;DR: I've been incredibly regretful with my choice of school and will be transferring colleges as I've ultimately decided this place isn't for me. What advice do you have to help me with the transfer process and find a school that's for me, and not with the issues I experienced (shallow social life, lackluster environment, not feeling valued and no support system from school).

If I had to say why I want to transfer, it's about things I can't change. I don't feel valued here, at all. The school doesn't care about me, most of the professors don't care about my wellbeing, and the people here don't care either. Since the bar is so low, there's a lot of drama, a lot of fake people and I found myself feeling lonely even in a sea of people. The social scene here is something I completely overlooked, it's just a bunch of Arizona high schoolers who stuck to their same friends, and everyone is really cliquey. The housing is sketchy, the area is far from any sense of safety, and the absolute wackjobs (meth-heads, cult people, etc.) near and on campus has given me immense anxiety attacks and a near death experience.

I don't feel like the effort I put into anything here is worth it, unlike the work hard play hard mentality that I have, it's work hard, play very little. ASU is a party school if you're a business major or a girl, if not well good luck finding a way to destress. The forced diversity here is actually a downside, just creates segregated groups of people. I'm incredibly lonely here, and don't have a support system. I tried the counseling services but it took me three months to get an appointment that only made me feel worse with a grad student just saying the same information I see online from people who've gotten the experience and everything they've wanted. The classes are easy, too easy where I am not challenged so I have too much time to think and get depressed and stuck in my head.

It's incredibly difficult to find a single like minded person here, and even then that's an understatement. I noticed that at universities that have high standards for students, such as myself, don't have this issue since they're all bright and smart. The campus architecture is actually pretty disgusting if you look at it, nothing matches and it's all a mess just to retain some pitiful title of #1 in innovation. Greek life here is okay, nothing to write home about and we are mediocre at sports. This school feels like a scam, and a waste of my potential.

I always felt like there's some place much better for me, that values me and suits my needs of having a support system and also letting me thrive. I only went here because my brother did and I thought he had everything all figured out, but after I spent time with him I realized how miserable he really was, and I'm not going down that same path. I can't be here anymore, and I'm only here to finish this semester and leave.

I don't know where else to look for school, and that makes me even more stressed since I have to figure all of this out again, and somehow get out of this mindset that is tearing me apart, every single day. I've relapsed too many times and it's not just a me problem, it's an ASU problem and I'm tired of people telling me to just wait it out, like I just want to be miserable for the rest of my life. So transferring is my only ticket out of here, and I don't know what I can afford because I don't have the opportunity to get any good scholarships like I did to come here in the first place. I'm not sure how to put this behind me, how I wasted my chance of freedom and lost so much money and time. It's really depressing, and somedays I get better but I always find myself back here. There's a lot I wish I did, but I can't change back time and I only waste it everyday.

So I'm not sure if those are valid reasons to leave, I feel they like are very substantial and significant towards my unhappiness here, and the social isolation isn't helpful either.

I had an older sibling, going to school here right now and he was here to help not feel so lonely. However, he's got a lot of work to do as well and I've been slowly getting trying to find my path than staying in his shadow.

The only things I like are the weather, the nice cars, and I enjoyed attending the football games but that is about it. The rest has been some of the biggest struggles and most miserable I've ever been, and even then seeing everyone around me have friends and happy makes me feel so much worse and out of place.

I don't know where to start looking, and to have extra stress for these applications but I just want to make the right decision this time, and I'm not sure how to do that I realized I need help or some advice since I didn't pick this college right at all and it shows.

Any advice on where/how to start this transfer process, what to look for in a college and how to do my due diligence for research?

I've been dealing with what feels like some of the worst depression I've ever felt since high school and I'm completely lost with no idea what direction my life is going in or even what direction I want it to go in. I almost failed high school because of the same mental health issues and for whatever godforsaken reason I decided to go straight into college. Maybe it was because I felt pressured by my parents, or maybe it was because the idea of being able to move out after a year in a university transfer program was enticing, I'm not really sure. I missed pretty much all of my classes in the fall, but I'm trying really, really hard to not make that same mistake this semester. Even though I have missed a couple weeks. I honestly think that when I'm at my best, I'm a good student and a good learner but I feel like I haven't been at my best for a long time now. Tried the counselling at my school, but they never called me back about another appointment. 

Being a teacher was never really my main plan. It was my backup plan to my backup plan. For a while, I thought that I could really get into it. I even heard some stories from one of my profs talking about how it was his last choice, but it ended up being the best part of his life. Making lesson plans, bringing the best out of kids, that sort of stuff. I don't know if this is depression me talking, or just me me talking (if you know what I mean), but I don't really wanna be a teacher. I don't think I ever have.

Anyways, I’m a junior at a new school. This is my second semester here. It’s my first time living off campus, meaning I have to pay rent. My day consists of this; classes, go to the gym, go to work, and go to bed. I do that almost everyday. I really tried to get myself involved in clubs. I joined 4 and went to the meetings but have yet to make any actually outside connection with anyone. To make things worse, me and my boyfriend, who was my only friend for about a year, just broke up. Now I have no one. No one to tell about how good my lunch was or how I got an A on my bio test. I have two “friends” here and both are my roommates. All they do is drink and party. They don’t pay for their own stuff, have no cars, and are always bringing guys over. Now, I could care less what they do in their free time right. But they are the only people I can go out kn the weekends with. I never meet any new friends at the bars. Or the gym, for that matter, which is where I would prefer to meet some new friends. I guess I just genuinely don’t know what to do.

He wants me to go to a prestigious grad school since I have a high gpa, been in two other research labs and have 3 publications. I wanted to go to grad school at some point to advance in R&amp;D for engineering. I didn’t really want to stay tied to academics.

It's been weeks and I haven't made a single friend. Not that that's majorly important; that's certainly not why I'm here. But the more time goes on, the more weird I feel. I feel like an outsider or something. It seems like everyone has their own friend groups while they're here. I know it's easier for some of them because some are living together via dorms and I'm one of the people who commute.

I'm trying not to let it bother me, especially since my grades are a lot more important than friends. It's just hard sometimes. I've always been the weird person. I wasn't popular in high school. I barely had friends. Instead kids went back and forth between bullying me and ignoring me. The last few years of high school, my grades weren't nearly as good because school was just torture for me and I couldn't focus on school work anymore. I've never related to most people my age, or just people in general, probably partly because of this. I also had a parent die really young, so that screwed over my development and connecting with others.

Now, going to college and seeing everyone laugh with friends while I'm sitting by myself is kind of just bringing up those bad memories of high school. I had tried to make a friend the first week, but I haven't seen her since so I'm guessing she already dropped out. I'm trying to ignore all this, but it's slowly getting harder. I know it doesn't really matter, but I can feel my mental health slowly falling anyway. Once again, I feel like the freak that no one likes. I know that's probably not true, but I just...idk. I can't seem to forget how much I've never fit in. It didn't help that I'm about to turn 29 and it seems like a lot of people in my class are about a decade younger than me. That makes it even harder to relate to any of them. Some of them seem very... shallow and judgmental, just from sitting near them while doing schoolwork and accidentally overhearing conversations. I definitely don't want involved in that crap; I don't have time for drama, which they seem to relish in.

132,Zen-Paladin,1643071451,/r/college/comments/sc0d2s/is_it_bad_to_have_an_atypical_college_experience/,"So my experience with college has been up and down. At age 21(22 in June) I am doing an online degree with SNHU. Fully accredited, and can even use Sophia to knock out pretty much all for my general ed credits. My desired career is to be a state park ranger(California). I have been in touch with a ranger supervisor who steered me towards some volunteer opportunities which is great. That said I really stumbled in the beginning.

I am on the autism spectrum(Asperger's) so throughout high school I was a socially awkward loner and upon graduation was envious of my peers who were in extracurriculars, had fun times with friends and relationships,etc. A lot of my peers actually went to the local junior college to transfer as opposed to straight to university even those who were athletes or had better grades. I really should have done a gap year(which I had thought about) because I wanted to hurry and transfer to a state school and finally ''catch up'' to my peers in terms of social experiences. Long story short, two attempts at community college didn't pan out, got my EMT license(took longer due to COVID and procrastination) and my first attempt at 911 didn't pan out but wil go back after gaining some more experience first. 


So I guess basically instead of taking the time to truly consider what would work for me an plan things out/explore opportunities I kind threw myself into things. I don't know if my mom would have let me do a gap year(I tried to do it after my first semester didn't pan out, but she pushed me not too claiming it is hard to go back) but I really just wasn't ready. It wasn't just about making friends/not being lonely but also just having those people skills that are really valuable in the professional world and general adult life. Plus there's the general social pressure to do what's ideal. My mom had the more idealized high school and college experiences. During the peak of the pandemic where more things were closed down, she said that aside from getting your education college is supposed to be you having relationships and meeting the friends you still talk to in your 50s.

[The Ongoing Case of Assist. Prof. Matthew Belanger](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2021/08/25/question-nyus-control-over-nyu-shanghai-sits-center-faculty-suit)

“If I was a parent sending my student to a school in any foreign country and I knew that mother ship, as it were, was sending out these confused messages -- this is part of NYU, your child is going to get full uncompromising NYU experience with full academic freedom -- and then they’re sending out other messages that said, well, if we come down to a legal matter, we’re going to throw our hands up and say we’re not responsible -- that would worry me as a parent for sure, and it would worry me as a student,” Belanger said in an interview.  
\----------  
When I was at NYUSH, our class (the inaugural class) got away with murder. We did all the drugs. Every drug. You name it, &amp; I had it in China, or if I didn't, I knew where to get it. Many of us got caught. Repeatedly. And nothing happened to us. (unless you were a Chinese citizen. But they usually steered clear of the danger).

I graduated 4 years ago.

Last year, 9 students--6 Americans, one Moroccan, one Finnish and one Malay--were [forcibly detained by the Chinese authorities for suspected drug use.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/american-students-arrested-china/2021/03/16/1b284f6e-8690-11eb-8a67-f314e5fcf88d_story.html)

I remember my parents worrying about me while I was in China. They knew how risky it was, me being in an authoritarian country, where benign misbehavior could bring harsh consequences.

I told them not to. I never wanted them to know how reckless I was being.

What I never appreciated at the time, though, was that both of my parents had their roots in communism--my mother Cuban, my dad half-Russian and half-Bulgarian. Both sides of my family have suffered. Within both, there are some who still do. I grew up in America--in Florida, at that--and they knew I had never faced anything like this before.

My major while I studied in China was called ""Global China Studies."" If that sounds weird, it should. It's a major specifically created by NYUSH, meant to cultivate an understanding of China's past, present, and future, in the context of its massive &amp; ever increasing influence over the world.

Classes explored topics such as, ""what is China?"" and provoked discussions about which other parts of the world, if any, should be considered part of China. Taiwan? Hong Kong? Singapore? Why not? Areas such as Tibet &amp; Xinjiang, however, were off-limits for discussion, except in the context of explaining how, indeed, those areas could &amp; should be considered ""Chinese"".

Another class I took, led by one of the now-heads of the department, Prof. Lena Scheen, was entitled ""Social &amp; cultural debates,"" and was structured as a debate class. Students formed into teams and argued for &amp; against the Communist Party on various issues. In the end, we would conclude, there is no right &amp; wrong. It all comes down to how well you argue your side of things.

What was conspicuously absent from the curriculum, however, was anything related to past Chinese philosophy--arguably the one thing I was most excited to learn about at the time.

I did manage to study Chinese philosophy in-depth, but not as part of any class; rather, because my Advanced Chinese language professor, perceiving me to be losing motivation during my senior year (I was having nervous breakdowns in 2016 related to a series of deaths in my family), tried to engage me by giving me Feng Youlan's ""A Short History of Chinese Philosophy"" translated in both English and Chinese. It worked. I ate it up (and I passed his class).

What I came to learn from Feng Youlan, who lived &amp; wrote during the time of the Republic of China (which we now call the Taiwanese government), was that the currents of Chinese philosophy maintained a continuous balance for millennia. Confucianism and Taoism both complement and contradict one another; one cannot exist without the other, yet one will always try to prove superior to the other. They both had their respective periods of prominence, and neither has ever been wholly insignificant.

Until now.

What the Chinese Communist Party has achieved is unlike anything in the history of China. One might even be justified in saying that the Chinese claim to ""5,000 years of unbroken history"" is insincere--that, for all practical purposes, their vaunted unbroken link to ancient times ended in 1949.

Neither Daoism, nor Confucianism is a governing principle of the CCP. Theirs is the philosophy of Qin Shi Huang, the first unifier of China, for whom ""China"" is named in the West; who rounded up the scholars &amp; philosophers; who outlawed criticism of himself; who disguised himself among the people to identify malcontents; who coined the concept of ""legalism,"" which meant ""the law is the basis for all morality,"" a new philosophy, which he hoped would dominate over all the others with time; against whom countless rebellions were fought, and every time, ruthlessly crushed

Even he could never have envisioned such absolutism. The Chinese today don't rebel. They can do nothing but try as they might to live a peaceful, contented life, knowing deep in their hearts that nothing will change; trying to see the bright side of everything; hoping never to be caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.

I recently came across this [opinion piece](https://nyunews.com/opinion/2021/04/29/nyu-shanghai-ccp-student-arrest-political/) from NYU News. Jack Li has never met David Pe. He can't appreciate how right everything he wrote in this piece actually is, right down to the words ""passive and disturbingly muted"". His blank expression was the background of my cellphone for years. I loved showing it to people because the angle made him look like a robot on standby mode. Likewise, though, I never could have appreciated at the time who that robot really answered to.

I thought living in China and being reckless would in itself be a learning experience. I was right, though not in the way I expected.

Now, looking back over my shoulder at the place that is becoming of NYUSH, and trying hard not to think about how easily that could have been me in the news, I feel I finally understand what the institution was meant to teach us--a lesson all four of my grandparents, if I had ever met them, would have surely said they knew well: How to live happily under authoritarian control.

I'm 19 years old, first year of college and studying managment engineering. I have always been an excellent student, since when I was a kid, and I have always loved a lot maths subjects (maths in general, geometry, physics,...). So after finishing high school (98/100, at least grades are given this way in Italy), I decided to apply for managment engineering in a city where I knew nobody. I did not think much about this, the fact that I was alone in a new city, but I said: fuck it, I have always been a pretty boy (at least everyone says so) and have always a ton of friends, so I thought I would not have had any problems making friends. And I was right, I made some new friends and I started studying.

classes in my first semester were: algebra, calculus 1 and programming in C (something I ve never tried). I start the semester, calculus and algebra are pretty easy for me, but programming gets really difficult and I spend my days studying programmig. I take the algebra exam and I get the highest grande in the whole college without even trying that hard. The days keeps passing, and while they do I start falling in love with programming, while I start to dislike maths and calculus (I don t fcking know why), and this gives me a really strange feeling inside of me.

Christmas holidays arrives and I keep programming, and I kinda like it! On the other hand, I kinda don t like maths anymore, I realize I just can't study it, and it is really boring and even hard to understand (even the topics I understoon in high school). Given the fact that my entire degree revolves around maths, I start to panick and start to think to drop out and change degree.

However, even thought I'm kinda liking programming and computer science, I know what in the computer science degree you have to know a lot of maths, and this scares me a lot. On the other hand, I' m afraid of think to drop out of college or even to switch major, so I'm really confused on what to do right now. I actually don't know what I like in my life and don't know what I would like to pursue in my carreer, and I'm stuck in this limbo.

I surely don't lack of will to study (I passed all the exams I took and with almost max grades in them al), but I don't know if studying in this field will keep me unhappy over time,  while on the other hand I'm afraid that if I switch or drop out of college for some time I'll make a huge mistake.

Yea…but that’s no longer the case, I from September stopped caring about studies, since no one I knew from high school is in this uni it even made it hard to socialize, whenever I try too, I just can’t, and I just stopped working hard at home, I after come back from school I just lay in my bed and either I stare at the walls or just surf on the internet and because of that my parents tried to take my phone away so that I can study, I didn’t just started staring at the books or papers in front of me, in class I no longer ask questions because I feel so inferior to other students and when I tried once the teacher straight up ignored me so yeah I never asked a question after that, I can’t seem to concentrate in class idk why but I just can’t tried multiple times but I no longer can, and obviously it led me to fail all my assignments and my tests and yesterday I saw my mom crying and telling dad that she is hurt that I am failing my classes (she didn’t know that I was home, and my mom NEVER never cried) I felt like shit, so I just want to catch up, and go back to being a straight A+ student so at least I don’t fuck up for the finals that will take on February, so please reddit, I am begging you to help and give me some tips to at least start studying.

I am a CS student by the way.

140,StardustNyako,1641953185,/r/college/comments/s1ucsw/reddit_i_am_burnt_out_and_i_need_help/,"Basically, I am at a place where I'm in my second semester as a ""junior"" and I, just feel like I can't keep doing this. For context, I am 26. When I graduated high school in 2013, that was, a mostly miserable time, except the last year. The ultimate kick in the butt was when my mom lost her job due to layoffs right before I graduated. So even though she got a job before uni started for me again, she insisted I started at community college. 

Shit was hard cause I worked, went to school, only to come home to a dysfunctional family that constantly treated me like lesser. So I went to a trade school to try and speed things up. Graduated, got a contract job for 5 months, but nothing after that. I needed a degree society told me. Fine. I worked, went to school, got into a public ivy. 

That's how hard I worked, because that's how much I just wanted to leave my toxic family. That was my only goal, and I worked my ass off for it. Once I got to my uni, there was still set backs, my major didn't work out so I had to pick another. I still am not passionate about it, but like, it's interesting I guess. 

But, that's my issue. I kept pushing forward to get a job that didn't make me miserable to allow me to live a life I could enjoy (not to get rich, just to be comfortable). And, that I guess, isn't enough anymore. I don't really have an in person support system. I talk to people on the internet for support. I love them, I've tried many times to go places to meet people, virtually and not, but due to likely Autism, I really struggle to naturally and deeply connect, or connect at all with most people.

So I don't have people to talk to, I have some friends in the house I live in to banter with but not talk to per say. Not to discount them, they're usually wholesome people. The problem is, I've been marching forward, for so long without having people, there.  

So, I'm just, tired. I'm tired of the endless school work, tired of telling myself I'm almost there, and then some setback pushes the goal psot farther away. I can only be an endurance longer so long. I guess I just don't feel like this is endurance anymore, but a sick joke.

 I have to deal with a lot of past trauma stored up, because my insurance won't cover a trauma specializing therapist, and because of my internship taking me out of state, I can't justify paying for a year of insurance when I won't get to use it for a third of my year. Applying for insufficient coverage feels like it won't get me any where. I can'ttake time off because I'm living off financial aid. I can pivot careers once I am done school but I can't jump off this ladder after everything. I just need to earn my darn bachelors. I'm debating telling my best friend about this, for some reason just considering that got me fuckin' balling. I think because she's the first person since my elementary school occupational therapist to actually outwardly say and show that she believed in me.  Ah, yeah, I think that's it. I am just at my limit, continuing to work through classes is getting hard.

142,Delta280,1641251407,/r/college/comments/rveva5/should_i_transfer_after_1st_year_or_2nd_year_ends/," **TLDR**: unsure of how I feel about my current OOS school, Oregon State, and have been considering transferring back to in-state, such as UCSC and UCD. I don't know transferring is justified by me not enjoying social life (I just don't fit in? more on it below). Also, should I transfer after my freshman year ends or after sophomore year? UC Davis is another option I would like to consider, but if I transfer to UCSC, that option is completely closed off to me because UC Davis doesn't except sophomore transfers for Computer Science/Engineering. But, if I transfer after Freshman year to UCSC, I might get a chance at having a somewhat normal college experience). UCSC also has a **massive housing crisis** which is what originally turned me away from it.

~~this is a strikethrough line to act as a border but idk how to do it on reddit so why are u reading this~~

&amp;#x200B;

**Note**: --&gt; indicates an important reason as to why I might transfer

Hey reddit! So, I am in an interesting situation, so I guess I will start from the beginning.

So, I was in the class of 2021 in Sacramento, CA. My original goal was to go to University of Washington for their Computer Engineering program, but I discovered quickly after my rejection that it was near impossible to get accepted out of state for their program. So, I decided I would either go to UC Davis, UC Santa Cruz, or Oregon State University.

At the time, I was waitlisted both at Davis and SC. Eventually, May finally rolled around, and I got off the waitlist of UCSC. I was thrilled at the time, since I had gotten denied from Berkeley, UCLA, Irvine, and Santa Barbara. However, when I was looking into the school, the fact that the major was **impacted** and there was a **massive housing crisis,** which scared me. It was also further than UC Davis, so I didn't know what to do. I think this was where I made my first mistake, and decided to not put a deposit down for UCSC and hope that I would get accepted into UC Davis. However, when I was visiting Oregon State, I got the rejection letter from UC Davis, and I was devastated.

When I was visiting OSU's campus, I didn't feel that 'magic' that some people get. I thought it was average, thinking that it was similar to what I would be getting if I went to Sac State (a CSU). So, I was committed to Oregon, and when I was going into week 4 of my term, I was definitely not feeling that great about it. I feel isolated from my former friends, I'm not a big fan of Corvallis (I wish it was a bigger town with more things to do), and I just feel lonely. Currently I am now in second quarter.

&amp;#x200B;

\--&gt; A huge part of my former high school was that our Cross Country team was closely knit, as in that we were all friends and ran together all of the time. It was almost like a second family in a way. At Oregon State, however, the bond doesn't feel as close as it did in high school. I don't really resonate with any of the people there, and while some of them are fast, I am not particularly a fan of the workout routine.

\--&gt; Some of the main things that has impacted me have been the weather, campus, and social life at Oregon State. I have been quite depressed with the weather, and I am not a particular fan of the campus. Every time I walk up to my dorm building and to the dining hall, I just get depressed. I feel like there is no point in being here. I know I am here to learn but I am not motivated by the weather or campus. I thought I would enjoy the rain, but apparently not so much.

&amp;#x200B;

The food also hasn't been that great at Oregon State, which I read somewhere that it has a huge affect on your mental health.

My classes (mostly been bacc core) have definitely felt a step back from high school. I didn't think I'd say this, but I miss the AP classes. I think that high school definitely challenged me more than OSU has so far. If I went to UCSC, I would only be 3 hours away from home versus 8 hours, which I feel is a substantial difference and would let me go home more often, if I need to. Oregon state's campus has also been somewhat disappointing. Money is not an issue, but I feel that **out of state tuition** for Oregon State University doesn't justify how I feel about the school.

A big thing that I have had trouble dealing with is the fact that I tried to work very hard in high school (4.3 gpa, 3.85 unweighted), but I'm not able to go to a prestigious university. I know that everyone says it doesn't matter what college you go to, but rather the connections. While I know this, I've just had trouble dealing with it. Some people have told me that people put UCs on a pedestal when in reality they are just like any other decent university, except they are quite crowded and it's very difficult to get your required classes.

So, I was wondering if I should reapply to UCSC and/or UC Davis, and to know what my chances are of getting back in. What is the policy of first year transfers, is that even possible at UCSC, or even any UCs? Credit articulation is something I am also concerned about, as I would have to **change my schedule by the end of this week** if I want to commit to the **sophomore transfer path.**

144,DecisionNo8733,1640585272,/r/college/comments/rpghse/homesick/,"Senior here going into my last semester of college this spring. My last few months have been a little more rough then usual. To give a little background, I attend college in Florida, 7-8 hours (traffic depending) away from home which is in a different state. The drive home is not unrealistic, but it is difficult for something like a weekend. I miss being home and I miss seeing my mother (single parent) as well as my grandmother. It’s also hard being apart from my dog. He’s my little best friend and has been by my side for the years leading me up to go into college. Even though flights are cheap, I have a full time internship coming up where I won’t have the time to go home and skip a class here and there. It’s Monday-Friday with weekends off. 

As much as I miss my family, I can’t constantly fly or drive home to see them. I know I could go on a weekend if I really wanted to but it’s a hassle to get to the airport, go through the trouble of flying, etc. I also have an established life down in Florida. Leaving here and there messes up the flow that I have. I really emphasize stability. It makes me feel like I’m stuck in the middle. 

Some of this home sickness feels like it’s stemming from not knowing where I’ll be next year. I’m in school to be a teacher, so it would all depend what part of Florida I am in. I can very much move even further away from home. It also guarantees that I will probably not move up towards my family, and they do not plan on leaving the state they’re in, mostly due to the fact that they just built a home within the last 2 years there. 

It stinks having my family far away. I tried to live there and it just wasn’t for me. We moved from New York originally and it did not feel like “home” to me. Even though my family is there. So moving back near them would not be a great option. I want to be somewhere that feels like home, not somewhere that just is home. 

Is there any junior/senior students in a similar situation that would have advice?

I know life will always bring upon change and I’ll always embrace it. Opening new chapters in your life is important, but it can be very difficult as well.",college,Homesick,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/rpghse/homesick/,1640603272.0

I was overwhelmed by the difference between community college and my CSU. It took ten years to finish my AA cause I did it in a five year chunk of taking hella classes but not transferring, then a four year break, then 2 semesters and a summer to finish my AA.

However, I got excellent grades my second attempt at school, and was even in the honors program. This semester I transferred and registered for 4 upper division courses. 

It was so much work and it was so hard. I procrastinated because I felt overwhelmed and the more I procrastinated the harder it was. I basically did an entire asynchronous Archaeology course in about 3 weeks when I had 16 to get it done. Took no credit for my existentialism class just so I could get archaeology done.

I missed two quizzes when there were only 6 quizzes, a paper and a final for a poli sci class. He saved me by giving me 40s instead of 0s and I got As on everything else. My last class was another poli sci (intro to Comparative politics) and I was able to keep my head above water.

I ended up with two As (intro to Comparative politics and archaeology), a c in the other poli sci class I took, and a no credit for that philosophy course.

On paper I earned a 3.33 but I am honestly super ashamed of how overwhelmed I got and how much I procrastinated. I should have had straight As or maybe a B or two, not this half assed gpa that I know better than to earn.

Let's hope next semester is far better and I will be able to adjust better to the rigor of upper division courses.",college,Upper division courses after transferring are no joke,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/rm9227/upper_division_courses_after_transferring_are_no/,1640209189.0

I know so many have it worse, and I am very lucky to be allowed to take a leave of absence from college and to have a mom who is letting me take that time off and stay with her without paying rent. But even so I’m frustrated.

I am not mentally well or functioning. I have unresolved trauma and other mental health conditions (been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, adhd, and then it switched to major depression with psychotic features but then my psychiatrist said it was trauma causing the delusions so who knows). Anyway, the diagnosis doesn’t matter. I’ve just about completely lost it and burnt myself out to the point where I am just failing over and over. I keep withdrawing from classes and/or taking incompletes. I ended up in the hospital last year because I was so overwhelmed I was suicidal. I have already taken two leaves of absence. 

I’m on my second leave right now and I’ve maxed out all my leave time. I’ve been on leave the pst two years, I was granted this time in order to heal mentally enough to go back to school. I haven’t been able to do much healing at all. A huge part is probably my own fault but still, it’s so hard to get better when you are in such a dark place, but your family (in my case it’s just my mom and I, dad out of the picture and no siblings)  isn’t supportive but you are dependent on them. I tried to set out on my own and failed miserably landing me in a psych ward with enormous bills. Now I am staying with my mom and I’m supposed to be figuring out my mental health issues but instead I feel like I’m just getting through day, surviving, and unable to even begin to heal in this environment. We didn’t even have a house of our own for most of the past two years, we were living with another family. We have a rat infested store front that we are paying for and I am trying to help my mom move out of. She has a hoarding problem and it is reluctant to let go of anything but it’s exhausting going through it all. It’s hard to walk around in there. I am supposed to be taking classes online to catch up for the classes I failed/withdrew from, but I can’t afford it and have to hide this from my mom (well that’s my own fault I was too afraid to tell her). My mom also doesn’t think I have real mental health problems, doesn’t believe in therapy, hates all of my past therapists, wouldn’t let me finish my IOP program because she said it was a waste of money and she had to drive me because I don’t drive (my own fault, I’m so anxious I’m afraid to even try now) nor would I have a car to use. I want to take the train but she won’t let me. She said she won’t teach me how to drive either but I don’t have anyone else and can’t put for driving school which she’ll say is a waste of money. She won’t let me work anymore either, even if I just use the money to help out with rent, or to help pay groceries, etc. because she needs my help constantly at home, 24/7. She is mostly nice to me as long as I do whatever she wants, whenever she wants, and don’t do anything else. Helping her with all the daily tasks (she literally has me bring her lip balm), and taking care of the house, it ends up taking up a lot of my time. The. She complains about how I’m not making money but she won’t let me work if it is not a fancy internship with flexible hours and fully virtual! (There are none) We are still back and forth between states trying to move out of her store front (to save that money lost on rent) and it’s a disaster. We are in so much deb relying on other people. I am making no progress in my life and I am ashamed. I feel like I can’t make progress on my mental health away from college, where I have privacy, food, consistent, clean place to live in, my own bed, no need to travel constantly between 3-4 residences, no one I have to take care of, freedom to pursue part time work of my choosing, as well as friendships, and of course therapy and psychiatry without having to hide it or keep it a secret. Yet I also can’t complete college until my mental health is better I think, despite trying again and again. What should I do? I am at a fancy liberal arts college but on the brink of being kicked out. I don’t blame them but I don’t know what to do — whether they let me return or kick me out. I know I am not owed a college environment just to “heal” in! I don’t expect my college or my professors or my government to help me in this situation. At all. And frankly much of it is a consequence of my own repeated terrible choices. But at same time, it bothers a bit me that my college — and everyone else it seems — assumes that this two year leave of absence is chance for me to heal and figure out my mental health. I mean of course you would assume that, I did too, but it’s been more like trying to survive with very little money and unstable housing, which has been an everyday battle, and help my mother, and function minimally, while holding on by a thread. I feel I’m worse off than when I left. And I feel judged by everyone. 

I’m not just here to complain though I know it sounds like that. I would love advice. I am not mentally mature and there are probably many options I’m just not thinking of.

147,Used-Shift-6284,1639454144,/r/college/comments/rfyj3v/i_cant_help_but_feel_im_a_failure_to_my_parents/,"Tldr: my parents worked really hard to try and set me up to go to a top school in the country (eg Ivies, MIT, Caltech, Stanford, etc) and I only ended up going to the basic state school. Title explains the rest.

When ive voiced these feeling in person I’m often told I’m elitist, vain, conceited, etc. and I’m sorry if it comes across that way but I really don’t mean to be - I’m genuinely typing this up while crying because ive been upset about this for the past 3 years.

3 years ago when I was applying to colleges, I applied to roughly 13 different schools for engineering, with my state school being my safety/last choice. I got rejected from every school except that state school, and ended up going there. My parents had put in a lot of effort to push me to go to any one of those other 12 schools, and they really expected me to get in (1500+ sat, 750+ on the subject tests, 4.2 gpa, you get the idea). My father definitely took the news better than my mother, who said I was a failure that disappointed her by not working hard enough. Frankly I agree, I do feel like a failure who took her hard work for granted.
Fast forward to today (end of first semester of my junior year) where she just heard that my cousin who she considers an “idiot” (barely broke a 1300, smokes weed, spent the last few years trying to make it as a SoundCloud rapper with no success) just got into an Ivy for Environmental Science. Naturally she calls me up upset, complains about my cousin, tells me I’m stupid for going to this school, and that im a failure. Not wanting to hear it I say “I’m sorry I go to a shitty school mom, and I’m sorry I’m a disappointment”, then tell her I’m busy and politely hang up. I then start to cry because I do feel like a failure and I know I’ve disappointed her, and I hate this stupid school that everyone from my high school went to and no matter how well it does rankings wise or whatnot, I still feel like I’ll always be embarrassed of it.

Any advice? I’m so tired of being a student here, and I already tried to transfer out - no success. I don’t plan to go to my graduation in a year and I don’t think I’ll ever not feel ashamed of going to this school. I already know I’ll never hang my diploma up because I feel like in the eyes of everyone who matters to me, I might as well wipe my ass with it so it’ll at least be useful for something.
And no, please don’t say something like “oh well ur moms a bitch lol”, I love my mother and I do feel she only wants better for me. I’m just so sad that I’m incapable of not disappointing her.

148,sleepyminidachshund,1639305937,/r/college/comments/reml47/reflecting_on_this_semester_and_how_odd_it_was/,"TL;DR - I feel I was socially outcast because of my age and grades. Advice on making friends moving forward? 

So I’m on “older” student (25) in my first year at a 4yr university. I got my associates at a community college while I was in the military and got out to pursue my degree full time. This was my first semester so I took it easy and only took 1 science class which is A&amp;P1. Literally everyone in this class is aspiring to go to med school or equivalent and I’m no different(dental honestly but same idea). First test this semester I bombed. I’ve never been one to have to study so this was new and honestly a wake up call. I put together a study group and got the highest grade on the next test and have been pretty consistent sense. But here’s the kicker my study group dumped me after the second test. No reason just started meeting without me and made another group chat only answering my messages to find out what I got on test. I found out from one of the group members it was because of my grades and that “I don’t like to hang out”. I live off campus with a partner and don’t really want to invite anyone over who I don’t know as we have a lot ove nice things we’ve worked hard to collect and don’t want ruined. I don’t drink in fact I never have (neither does my partner no reason other than we just don’t like it and thinks it’s a waste of money) I have been used so much as a DD and an alcohol provider, I don’t like to put myself in that situation. Anyways all that is beside the point. Is this what I have to look forward to on my next year and a half? People being weird about my grades and acting weird cause I told them when they asked? I even tried checking myself and making sure I’m not sounding condescending,rude or disrespectful. Tried avoiding the conversation all together as well but people insist. It feels odd to lie about something like grades. Also any advice on getting along? I feel like I’m connecting better with the TAs than I am my peers.

149,Woat_The_Drain,1639269885,/r/college/comments/red0eu/american_colleges_are_a_scam_even_for_stem/,"**TL;DR: American colleges prioritize anything else over teaching and do not run a tight ship.** 

**WARNING:** All the examples I give are from the university I went to, but I went to a highly acclaimed American school and I know many people who got a lot less from other ""better"" schools who paid a lot more than I did. It also goes without saying that all of these examples are much worse at most American ""party"" schools where they prioritize teaching and career prep even less, and I know a lot of people who went to these types of schools.

**I know what you're thinking: ""This is some kid who didn't do well and didn't find a job so he is blaming his problems on something else."" Actually, this is further from the truth.** 

**I graduated with an engineering degree with a high GPA and I easily got a good job in my field after graduation. I am satisfied with my life at this point.** I definitely learned a lot in college, but I can't help think that I could have learned a lot of this on my own without spending 10s of thousands of dollars or at least what I got out of college was not worth the price. Even with an academic scholarship for 50% off tuition, I still paid a ton of money. I was really funny to see that athletes got priority in an institution that was supposed to be about learning. I actually almost became a starter on one of our best varsity teams since I was recruited, but I figured it would be a waste of time since I don't want to spend 4 years playing sports instead of learning. Athletes had the same scholarship I did, but with a 0.5 point lower GPA requirement and with preferential treatment in course scheduling. I get that athletes need to get priority to schedule things around practices and games, but this just proves that American colleges prioritize sports over actual learning.

I used to be a college advocate because people in my industry frequently told me that they prefer college graduates over self-taught people because in college you learn the meaning behind all the principles that you are taught and you could therefore be creative and extrapolate them to engineering new things. Despite this argument, I kept noticing that all I need from college are these key explanations, and professional instruction, which is what I got, but I still think the price I got them for is a rip-off. Some of the best professors I ever had agreed with me. In class they would say ""Tuition is ridiculously expensive and the price that you guys pay per hour to be here is unjustified so it's in your best interest to pay attention.""

I think that this is caused by colleges falling prey to chasing profits. **There is nothing wrong with chasing profits since it is a great incentive structure to make your product better, unless it causes your product to get worse...**

American colleges nowadays prioritize selling ""The College Experience"" over learning and being tough. They love to raise tuition so that they can pour millions into sports facilities, professors' research that sometimes isn't very useful, and random events that totally overpower the actual objective of being there: actually learning. I loved the ""College Experience."" Partying and having fun with friends and going to events and being able to discipline myself as an adolescent to get my life together was great...but I can do all of that without paying tens of thousands of dollars. Unfortunately this has created a perverse incentive structure where student ""happiness"" is prioritized over learning. Colleges will get more student satisfaction and good reviews if they make their classes easy, super informal, and have the professors bow down to the students. American adolescents love this type of stuff since they are immature and have been sold this type of lifestyle. And I don't blame them. Why would you go to a school with hard classes and strict professors, when you can get the same degree from a school with a similar ranking/reputation with easy classes and pushover professors?

I went to a pretty good engineering school, but I would not send my future children there. At least, I would not give the school any of my money. There was so much blatant cheating, professors that changed grading schemes and gave extreme curves because we were so lazy, and students would show up to class late and in pajamas just to play on their phone the whole time while their parents were paying dozens of their hard earned dollars per hour for their kids to be there. 

So many of my classes were easy A's because the professors were basically afraid of upsetting the students. And I remember so many classmates prioritizing taking a ton of easy freshman-level classes as electives over actually practical ones just so that they could get their degree with no effort. I despised this. I thought ""You were blessed enough to be born in the U.S. into a middle-upper class family and have your parents pay for your degree and you have the audacity to sign up to learn nothing in these easy classes just so you can get the participation award."" Each year we had a credit limit of 20 per semester and any credit amount over 12 credits was just charged as a one-time ""Full Time"" tuition, so someone taking 12 credits would pay the same as someone taking 20 credits. I made it a point to take 18-20 credits EVERY SEMESTER of my college years, except my last semester when I took 16 credits of Graduate-Level courses and focused on my job search. I was paying them money and I was going to get my money's work

Not all bad classes had bad professors. Many of my professors were geniuses who had a lot of good stuff to say, but they were not held accountable for their class not being worth the money. I thought it was disgusting that these smart men and women had the worst organization skills that I have ever seen. We used the ""Canvas"" software that most schools use and these professors had no clue how to use it. They would also forget to upload essential material that they said they would, spent the entire semester grading assignments that were due in the first week of class, changed the rules of the course as they went, and were disorganized in general. I had a professor who never used slides or prepared material. This was a highly technical, mathematical, and logical class. He just had a list of topics to cover per lecture and he would actively write out the lesson as he went. His verbal explanations were better than any supplemental material and he taught us deep explanations as to why these mathematical structures operated as they did. The problem was that he wrote everything in a Google Doc in Arial font, including diagrams written on the fly in Google Drawings with a laptop trackpad . Thus, looking back on the notes was effectively useless. He also made new rules on the fly like ""pop quiz every week to encourage you guys to study"" that only happened twice before he forgot about it. He also barely wrote essential planning info down like test dates or test info. Now, you may think: ""OP, you are complaining about college being too easy, but get mad when the prof doesn't spoon feed you the info."" I'm not mad that he didn't spoon feed the info and wrote everything during class, like how college used to be (which is cool). I am mad about his lack or organization and me spending much of my time dedicated to that class trying to guess what would happen next. I learned a lot of essential info from the two classes that I took with that professor, but they could have been perfect if his organizational skills weren't abysmal. He did have two very smart TAs but they were effectively useless. Why you may ask? Because we barely got homework. We got 4 very large homework assignments throughout the whole semester even though he promised 12+. This sounds like a simple class structure difference, but most college students don't learn well like that. The best classes had mandatory small and frequent assignments that led up to the large projects so that we would get constant practice and have a reason to got to the TAs for more info and help. But, when you make the homework assignment very infrequent (or make homework optional, as other classes did), you create an incentive structure where students will prioritize homework from other classes over your own. **Disclaimer: There is nothing wrong with students being held accountable for motivating themselves to study often and put in work, but if you are charging obscene amounts of money you cannot ignore the basic psychological fact that adolescents are more likely to learn if you give them mandatory constant practice that is, each time, a little harder than their current abilities.**

I did have a few great classes with great professors. ALL of my favorite classes involved the professor coming in on the first day and saying something along the lines of: **""If you are not here to learn, get out so you don't disrupt my lecture. I know a lot more about the world than you do so do not even try the BS that most college students do when they refuse to do work or beg for better grades. I don't care what grade you get and if you fail, you fail, but I just care that you learn a lot.""** I would pay good money to have my future children to take these classes. The professors cared and were not afraid to subordinate students' happiness to actually learning. They taught practical skills and were very aware that college was a rip off. 

**How to make College Classes Worth the Money:**

1. **Make sure the info is relevant and taught well.**
2. **Have constant practice with progressive overload via assignments and quizzes as well as frequent professor attention.**
3. **Hold the professor accountable for not doing his/her job or being too disorganized**.
4. **MAKE ASSIGNMENTS AND ATTENDANCE MANDATORY.** (It makes me sick to my stomach when a class has optional attendance and homework because only and idiot would believe that a bunch of 18-22 year-olds would prioritize that work over anything else).
5. **Cut the inflated salaries of college administrators and PRIORITIZE learning from industry and research professionals over having fun for 4-5 years.** (We would get emails every day about what cool fun events are happening on campus, but barely any on essential info to get jobs and known paths to success via hard work. I don't care about the new $10 million rec center full of random things that the school just built. I am here to learn and set myself up for a great career.)
6. **Don't let students run the show.** Teenagers and young adults are notoriously bad at discipline and everyone on Earth knows that college-aged young adults make impulsive and self-gratifying decisions while thinking about the short term. With this, you will greatly increase the chances of success of students.
7. **If you are a student, think about whether you need to go to college right now.** Maybe it isn't the best idea to get a degree in philosophy right out of high school just to have fun and blame everyone except yourself when you aren't a millionaire in 4 years. Set yourself up financially by getting a more practical degree or entering the job force and ensure stability. **Once you are stable and happy with your life, go back and get that philosophy degree** so you can put in your effort since you're more mature and don't worry about becoming poor. **If you are passionate about the ""less practical"" or non-STEM subjects, they are totally worth studying in a professional context...just not right out of high school by someone who knows nothing about the world and has no stability in his/her life.**

My favorite class in college was a class outside of my major but it had an excellent professor, practical info, and great structure. The professor did not have the most advanced degrees like other professors did, but he DAMN well knew how to run a class. We had lectures during the week where he would present like a professional public speaker and teach us only the most relevant information. Then we would have assignments each week based on that week's lecture that were slightly more advanced than our current abilities so we were challenged, but in a way that made us want to struggle and put in effort. The content of each assignment was always very relevant and I maintain those skills to this day. He came in on Day 1 and laid out the grading scheme and said that if anyone disagreed or thinks they can manipulate him instead of putting in the work, they can walk out right then and there. He kept his promise. I failed several assignments because they were hard, but I DIDN'T care. I learned a ton of info from the class and he made it clear that the assignments were challenging and that since we had a week to do them and TAs as a resource, all grades were final. I almost forgot to mention the TAs. The only people he allowed to be TAs were former students who previously earned a 95+% in his course and he treated them very well, so they were incentivized to do a great job. **This man earned my money and my respect.**

It was really sad to see that the students that got high-paying jobs at FAANG (now MAANG) companies or high-level engineering positions had GPAs in the low 2.0 range. They had initiative, drive, skills, and the ability to delay self-gratification. **They were only there to get the degree since most high-level jobs required one.** **This racket made them spend tens of thousands of dollars for no reason.** I also knew a lot of them and they were extremely smart. Not academic smart or ""book smart,"" but their problem solving skills and logical abilities were insane. They easily could have gotten 4.0s, but why waste their time, when they could learn a lot more on their own? These people easily had 140+ IQs and they all tried to get high-level jobs that didn't require a degree out of high school and they worked their asses off outside of school.

Most of the high-level skills that got me a good job were self-taught. :(

I really hope that there is some sort of shift from high-level jobs requiring degrees. Once that happens, colleges will be forced to make students get their money's worth in learning and the people that truly deserve those jobs will be motivated to get their money's worth or not to go to college at all. The modern American college system is a racket and they are not even hiding it.

**I, however, am hopeful. I go on job recruiting websites and see the GPA requirements getting lower and lower or even with a degree being optional. GOOD JOB.

151,ingloriousbiz,1638995880,/r/college/comments/rc0ed1/feeling_worthless_because_of_my_gpa/,"I am currently a first semester junior about to take finals. I started going to community college in the fall of 2019. I had entered in with dual course credits I had received while in highschool. I did not start at my current university until spring of 2020. I had about 50 hours and a 3.4 GPA. My highschool GPA was 3.8.

That semester was of course COVID. I had made Bs and As that semester. For some reason I thought it would be smart to take ""S"" grades as they were available to us. I regret that now as I had good grades. This landed me with credit hours but no GPA. The next semester (last fall) I stayed home because I had no choice. I struggled horribly.  I was working a full time job. I ended up making 2 Bs and 2 Cs. Last semester, Spring of 2021, I had the same problem. I was on campus, but I had no roommate, and all of my classes ended up being online. I had zero friends and no opportunity to make any.

I felt like a loser. I felt isolated. I felt like college was a mistake. I was struggling in classes, struggling making friends. I attend an extremely affluent, small private college. I got scholarship to go here that is why I can afford it. I felt like I was not fitting in with others. Greek life is also huge. Its so hard to go to parties or make friends if you are not in it. Anyway, I made 2 Bs and Cs once again.

&amp;#x200B;

I felt horrible about myself. like a failure. I decided this semester I had to make a change. Right now I am making As in 3 of my classes and 1 B. My current GPA is a 2.4. My transfer GPA included I believe is around 3.0 or a little less. After this semester if my grades stay the same it should be around a 2.8.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like an absolute failure. My goal of going to law school went out the window, so now for a job I am depending on getting a job working essentially at a strategic firm in the communications department. I don't even know if I will be able to do that because a lot of places have a cut off of 3.3 GPA. On top of that, I dont know if I can get an internship for the same reasons. I wasnt partying those semesters or not showing up to class. I felt extremely isolated and depressed. I wish I had taken a gap year. I am upset I didnt and I wont have a college experience. I tried to join many clubs and I got rejected mainly due to my GPA and my class year. Most of them want underclassmen.

&amp;#x200B;

I have job experience working throughout college and highschool, but they aren't for my major or future jobs. I feel like shit about all of this and it is so embarrassing. I love to learn and I was so excited about college and my future. I feel like I developed so much anxiety and I feel like shit because of my GPA. People say experience is more important than GPA, but I dont know how I am going to get experience or my foot in the door anywhere if they will throw out my resume as soon as they see I have below a 3.3.",college,feeling worthless because of my GPA,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/rc0ed1/feeling_worthless_because_of_my_gpa/,1639013880.0

Honestly, my life at UCSB was quite miserable. The environment just felt wrong to me. I don't wanna go into all the details, but I'm distressed and miserable there. I ended up having depression and anxiety there and had to see the therapist every week. I couldn't concentrate on anything and sometimes had to take sleeping pills. I felt relieved when I went back home after everything moved online. 

Now I'm back, and that anxiety and depression come back. During COVID, I constantly tried to convince myself that everything would be better, the school isn't that bad, I just didn't try hard enough in adapting, and I only need one more shot to fall in love with the school. But none of that happened, so I tried to transfer. I grew up in Hong Kong and I always love city life. I applied for several schools in NY and Boston and got accepted to Fordham Lincoln Center with 20k scholarship. I've lived in NYC for a couple of months before and I definitely love it there. But what keeps me from taking the offer is the ranking. Fordham is somewhere around 60th and UCSB is a top 30. I'm worried that prestige would hurt my chance of getting a job. I wanna study finance or Econ, and I plan to stay in the east coast after graduating. Even though I know that Fordham has good job placement in the Wall Street, the ranking still bothers me. Money would not be an issue. I pay out of state tuition at UCSB, that's 44k, and at Fordham I would be playing 35k. Living costs would be higher in NYC but my family can afford that.

I am a senior (23F) but I have done all three years and the last three years of high school all remotely because I had a phobia that wasn't treated. My parents are the disengaged type, so I've lived like a house rat for all these years barely leaving my room. I developed severe depression and I am trying hard to get out but I feel barely human. I have had no friends or other relationships since 16, and still lack the desire to have them. I'm a psych major and could add a philosophy major but it would take at least one extra quarter (worth it?) 

I say I've been 'detached', meaning I've been out of touch with reality, maybe borderline hallucinatory at times tbh, but I know what's real. What I don't know is how to exist with people my age. I know I have many biases I'm working on as I'm from an upper middle class white heteronormative household. It scares me how much I *haven't* been exposed to. I try to listen to podcasts and watch youtube videos to catch up on some things socially but I would love if people could recommend ways to learn about trends and what's acceptable for my age group. I feel so behind, I'm very ashamed, and when I feel as though I'm progressing, something reminds me that I am still so out of touch. I am scheduled to move to my single dorm next week. Every part of me says I shouldn't go. I really want to give up completely. 

Is college even relevant?   
Do people just go to socialize? Does anyone actually study?  
Am I stupid to be pursuing a degree especially in my mental state and with my history?   
How do I avoid embarrassment, especially as I'm not socially attuned?   
How do you stay motivated if you have no will to keep going and feel no pleasure?   
My fear overtakes me so much that I become debilitated yet no treatment I have tried (drugs &amp; therapy) has helped. Is there any hope for me?   
Would you be frightened away by my past? And.. do you think I'm strange?

154,Original_Director_46,1638516919,/r/college/comments/r7tmx1/what_the_fuck_can_i_do_about_my_roommate/,"I was friends with my roommate a few years before college. We were really really good friends. Not anymore, I hate the dude.

Here's a laundry list of what he's done 

1. He smokes weed all the time. Like non stop, every day, in the room. He does it in the bathroom when I'm around, so it doesn't smell. But when I'm gone the room fuckin reeks. He was smoking in the room while I was here and the RA told him to put it out or she'll call the cops. He's still smoking in the room.

2. He slept with the RA across the hall, made it a big deal, told fuckin everybody. Now the RA hates him and me. She lives across the hall, he smokes in the room.

3. He refuses to do the simplest of things for me. Such as turning his LED light strip off at night. I have insomnia so this makes it very hard for me to sleep. One night he came in at 2 am, turned them on, and it woke me up. I tried asking him to turn it off, but he repeatedly interrupted me with ""don't care, don't care, don't care"" and rhen said ""stop being a fucking child about it.

4. He has a fuckin 700 dollar TV stereo system, with a subwoofer. He blasts music late at night. People complain in our floor chat, he refuses to turn it down. I ask him to turn it down, he says no.

5. Speaking of weed, he didn't put anything away for room searches. I hid most of it (let me list off what he had. He had 3 ounces of weed, a dab rig, 7 lighters, dab concentrate, dab pens, rolling papers, and 4 grinders) but, there there were two grinders left out. Guess who wasn't there for the room search? He wasn't. I bailed his ass out lowkey. The RAs saw the grinders and called campus police. The cops were actually mad chill, and dumped the weed in the grinders into the trash. That way they didn't have probable cause to search my room. The cops fuckin saved my ass from expulsion and potential arrest. However, I still have to go to do some anti-drug bullshit.

6. He doesn't take any responsibility for his actions. Claims I ""overreact"". He talks shit about me to our mutual friends.

7. We got drunk, and I got annoyed with him. He ended up attacking me. He brags to people about how he kicked my ass and threw my head against the wall. Now, just a note, he didn't kick my ass, and to quote from somebody who was there ""it was just two drunk idiots fighting"". Some people came upto me, and asked me about it. I explained my side of the story and they said they heard some fantastical story about it. One of the kids, who I'm actually friends with now because of this conversation, said ""the whole thing sounded fucked up and it wasn't anything to brag about. I'm glad it wasn't as bad as he said""

8. He constantly acts like he's smarter than me. Any question asked, even if I know the answer, he'll interrupt and then over explain everything. It's like it fuels his ego or something.

9. Everytime I bring this up, he starts listing out things that I did. Note most of my shit is basic things like being kinda messy, he really has no counterargument to me, and it's always kind of amusing when he lists off completely unrelated things that have a very limited effect on him. Things he does can get me arrested, kicked out of college. Things I do are mostly minor inconveniences.

I have no fucking idea what to do about this. I can't believe I called this fucker a friend at one point. I'd rat on his ass, but all of our friends are mutual. It'd ruin my social life. I obviously can't talk to the kid, because he doesn't fucking listen. He has these grandiose ideas for his future, he always brags about how his father is an executive at Google, he constantly talks about the price of his things. I truly either think he's either a complete and total narcissist, or maybe he's so fuckin empty inside he needs to validate everything with money. I grew up poor, I can't fucking take this shit anymore. Cuz his family is so fuckin rich, he'll just lawyer up and get outta this bullshit. I don't have that kind of money. I really don't know what to do. I dread every fuckin minute of college because I have to go back to this fucking room. The fuckin housing department at our school overbooked dorms, so there's a long ass wait list to switch.

I'm at my wits end. This shit is both literally exhausting (I'm not sleeping as much as I'd like), it's emotionally exhausting cuz I once liked this guy, and I'm constantly stressing about him getting me into some fuckin bullshit. I can't do anything anymore. I could report him but all my friends would hate me. And I don't like snitching either.

 It's hard everyone has higher standards. Your expected to have your own deadlines and take responsibility. Partying every night is fun but the people who reach accidemic excellence don't party hard and expect to pass.


💥 In college there are alot of assessments.

You will literally have to organize your life around them.  Want to go to the college dance?
No your not you have that 50% assignment due tomorrow. The assessments seem never ending, and they are. Until one day they are all but a dream.

 💥Find a stimulant.

Now some days you might be pulling your hair out over some crazy 50 page assignment for 40% of the mark. Then it dawn's on you, that you only have a week left before the due date.  Stimulant's like coffee are your friend here.  If you have to pull all nighters to get that assignment done do it. (It's not like have a life outside of college) just remember to take quick naps and have lots of snacks to keep your energy up.

💥 If your school has a reliable organised online portal sometimes it's okay to skip a class especially if a deadline is coming up.

Skipping a class or two may be essential to both your accidemic potential or your Mental health. If you need to skip class do it. Get your classmate to write some notes for you, or check out the study guide on your universities online portal in your own time. Your health is more important than school.

💥 Your university has learning assistants, you pay for. Use the hell out of them.

You pay for a learning assistant. You can send them work to check spelling grammar and referencing. Some can even be specific to the subject and can act as a secondary tutor.

💥 University is fun

Have fun at university and make friends. You may have to pull all nighters studying but try and keep a balance.

 💥 Don't panic over one bad grade.

You can always try better next time. Try again or even just celebrate your mediocre grade if it was a hard subject for you.  You are not your grades. They do not define who you are or the effort you personally put in to achieve said grade. One year I put in an exceptional amount of effort and only ended up with a C in a hard subject.

In my psychology class, there is a professor who made me feel uncomfortable in the class. Each time, she looks at me in a strange seductive way that really gets on my nerves. It just feels uncomfortable dealing with a woman in her mid-thirties who keeps stalking me throughout the class and watches me at times. She seems to be very focused on me most of the time in the classroom and it feels awkward. None of the kids in class notice this as that she does it when nobody looks, between class breaks and even during test times. I come to class , try to do my work and pay attention but again, she keeps trying to flirt with me so much. I don't know how to deal with this anymore because it is hard when there's absolutely no help. Nobody believes me and there isn't proof to explain it to others.

I was discussing with her about it and I felt a bit confused about the assignment that she gave. The weirdest thing happened when she got close to me sexually.

157,hermean,1637998560,/r/college/comments/r38e6z/my_college_experience_summarized/,"Here’s a slight warning that this post may be a bit depressing for some. 

I’m 22, and next semester will be the beginning of my 5th year.

When I started out, I wanted to learn some programming to build and create amazing apps and websites. I wanted to do cool things and be like Tony Stark and Elon Musk. I spent months perfecting my common app essays so that the admissions officers would KNOW that I was special. 
Man I was bursting with ideas. I wanted to create an app that would suggest the perfect hairstyle based on things like symmetry of your face after you submitted some photos. I wanted to create a way to transfer files between computers without the internet, faster than what Bluetooth allows. Bluetooth replaced Infrared, and I wanted to make the thing that replaces Bluetooth. 

I even bought an unfinished mobile game on Flippa. It was this boring Galaga clone I wanted to make as exciting and colorful as Geometry Dash, and so I began to work on this in my free time. I wanted my game to be the next flappy bird. I also met this dude in my Astronomy class and we worked on opening a dropshipping store because it was supposedly a super easy way to make a ton of money online really quickly (it’s not). I wanted to learn another language in addition to the three I already speak because I was so so *special* and thought it looked impressive for jobs and such, and so I began a German minor. I didn’t know how I was going to go about any of this, but I had all the energy and ambition, I felt unstoppable. I did all this while schooling full time and working ~20 hours at a grocery store. This was too much for me, but I didn’t care that much. I thought that’s what everyone was doing. Everyone I met had beefy resumes already and we were only freshmen. I couldn’t do much in high school because I didn’t have a car at the time and I had to take care of my younger siblings while my parents worked long hours. So I was going to bend my back over to make up for all the white space in my resume. I felt like I had to catch up. I would have very little sleep each night because of my packed schedule and yet somehow I’d still have a ton of energy the next day, without any coffee. I didn’t want caffeine in my system. Alcohol? No thanks. I was on the straight edge wave and I preached it everywhere I went. 
**I don’t need any alcohol to have fun **

That was freshman year. That was 2018. But like most of us, the bulk of my college career had all the classic downsides. 

My CS first class was in Java, where I realized that I actually kinda hated coding, which fucked my world up because I was SO SURE that’s what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. And It’s also kinda funny because I have a lot of family and friends overseas counting on me to come back home a successful young man in that field because that was all I spoke of. I just breezed through all my classes as a kid back there. I didn’t have to try, at all. I didn’t have to study.

I started to get lonely and so I tried to join some clubs and orgs to meet people and get involved. This didn’t work out so well, and so naturally, my conclusion was that if I didn’t fit into any of these clubs, then the problem was with me. 

I hated all my classes and I hated myself. I watched the slow trainwreck take place as I skipped class after class and missed all the important deadlines. What did I do instead? Nothing. I would just lay on my bed and mindlessly scroll on my phone till I fell asleep, wake up, and repeat. I would also cry every now and then from feeling so sorry for myself lol. I barely ate, and I barely showered. I lost a lost a ton of weight. I didn’t try to get help, because I didn’t want it, and I just felt stuck. I would convince anyone that called to check up on me that school was great, and that my classes were going great, because I didn’t want them to worry. Meanwhile I was on track to fail all 5 of my classes from the comfort of my dorm room.

Luckily I didn’t fail all of them, I only failed 4 and escaped Calc 2 with a D. I lost my scholarship that semester, and it felt like my life was falling apart.

I went home that winter for the break and lied to everyone. Whatever i could say or do to divert attention from my grades and schooling, I said and I did. And my parents didn’t suspect a thing either because they know me to be a really good student. It made me feel that much more like a piece of shit and so I convinced myself that all I needed was some r&amp;r, and some planning to get my shit back together. 

I went to the career center the following semester for some direction, and they suggested a few classes for me to take to explore my interests.

That semester I met a girl at work. She was a regular customer, and I wanted to ask her out, so that’s when I started to get my shit back together. I got a haircut, got some proper hygiene going and all the necessary changes I had to make to be taken seriously. She said yes for whatever reason, and we were in a relationship for a while. Didn’t work out as much as I thought it would but I used my new found confidence to put myself out there. I met more women and ended up making some friends as well. We spent most of our time and money bar hopping pretty much every weekend, because the classes I had at the time were pretty easy and needed little attention. That semester was also my first time smoking weed. I also tried acid that semester, and before that I took myself pretty seriously. After that trip I loosened all the way up and turned into THAT guy. I was at every party. I flirted with any girl that looked in my direction for just a second. Everywhere I went. Honestly, looking back, some of the things I said and did were just gross. I was finally getting some attention and boy I was addicted. My thought process also was that I didn’t party as much as I could’ve during my freshman year, and so I wanted to make up for it.
 
COVID happened not long after and so  I used all the extra time I had to really figure out my college career. After lots of searching, I decided to pursue a BBA in Management Information Systems. I was drawn in because it didn’t have nearly as much coding as in compsci, but required a lot of the interpersonal skills I had now become comfortable with. I applied the following semester for the major and got denied, since my GPA was trash after I bombed that one semester. So I took pre reqs and core classes and applied again the following semester, only to get denied again. 

I considered taking a break from school, but knowing myself I don’t think I’ll want to come back after months and months of freedom, and I figured I was done with the bulk of it so may as well just finish up the little thats’s left.

I instead got offered my second choice, Economics, which I settled for because at that point I was just going to do whatever I needed to, to get out of there. School was draining me. I figured I could always come back to school for a different purpose when I felt the need to do so because I had no idea what the hell I was doing 

Fast forward to today, where I still don’t know what I’m doing. Many advise that I’m still pretty young, and that my degree won’t define where I’m going to end up. 

It’s hard to stay motivated for school. None of the jobs these companies come over here to sell us appeal to me, what do I picture myself doing? I don’t even know. I have no clue. Much worse, all the news reports we get these days just brings about so much despair. My friends are quitting the jobs I was planning to consider, which also happens to be the case all across the country. We’re also apparently fucking up the planet beyond repair. There’s threats of war in Eastern Europe. The inflation rates are insane, and now we gotta deal with this Omicron bullshit, just to name the top stories I’ve seen today. 

This has been a brief summary of what college has been like for me so far. I don’t know exactly how it’s going to help anyone but if you relate to any part of this then know at least that you’re not alone. It’s anecdotal, but I know lots of people in similar situations. We were all really smart kids growing up, but somehow things just didn’t work out as well as we hoped. Please just know that you’re not alone, you’re not stupid, dumb or slow. Your story is yours, please resist the voices that make you compare yourself to those that seem to “have it together”. Please know that you’re part of a huge crowd of people that have no clue what they’re doing.

Try your best as much as you can and just do the best you can for today, and rinse and repeat till you get your degree.

It’s not even been a full semester but I feel like I want to transfer. I don’t absolutely hate it here but I feel like there are bigger/better things for me. 

Background: I go to a small tech school in Massachusetts. Majoring in Electrical Computer Engineering. D3 Athlete.

Warning: I don’t want to here 4 years goes by so fast. You have so much time to explore and do your own thing b.s 


Things I don’t like about my school: 

Campus is dull (physically). Not really complaining about student body or social life here. 
-I feel like I walk to the same three buildings everyday. 
-The school is too lazy to even add street lights to light up the quad/sidewalks at night. 


Lack of food
-Only two dining halls. One of them is closed half the time. Food makes your ass explode. 

^This is hard especially as an athlete because I’d finish practice and all the dining halls would be closed. Additionally, I had to stay on campus over break for sports and the dining hall was closed midday so I couldn’t even eat a full meal beforehand.  

Academics:

-Lack of variety in course selections 
-School is overcapacity and you get waitlisted for literally everything  
-Most professors suck 

Administration/School itself 


To start we have had 4 suicides in the span of 4 months. At this rate, there is one suicide every month. 1 is too many in itself, but this is absolutely ridiculous.

a train. I never been so mentally
exhausted in my life. I basically sob twice a week and think about wanting to drop out. Within the first few weeks of college I had to start seeing a school counselor weekly. It was to the point where I wanted to drop off the face of the earth and disappear for a while.

Administration is “working hard” to find solutions. 

So far their solution to mental health was to give out free donuts and “mom hugs” 

^^ I know part of this is me and I can be happy here if I tried but I don’t want to spend 4 years here and regret the things I missed out on

What I want: 

-More urban setting (ideally I would like to be in Boston) 

-School that has strong stem program but also a lot of humanities/liberal arts

-More diverse campus/student body 

-Be able to continue my sport elsewhere

-Overall more attention from administration to care for students needs. 

Are these valid reasons? Is it really worth leaving everything I have here to start over somewhere else?",college,I want to transfer but I am not sure if I’m just getting in my head.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/qzgift/i_want_to_transfer_but_i_am_not_sure_if_im_just/,1637586479.0

I tried joining clubs, saying hi, and be overall approachable and open, yet I felt even more lonely in college compared to high school when I didn't do as much to try to make friends. Despite what popular opinion among old people is, most parties in college aren't open invites and it is extremely hard to get invited to a party. Most friends don't just invite everyone they know.

I’ve tried to strike up a few conversations with people next to me. They definitely just wanted to be left alone. I even got a couple peoples phone numbers that seemed cool but they ghosted me immediately. This never happened to me in community college.

164,Risky_Biznus,1636383929,/r/college/comments/qpfikv/moving_back_to_school_postpandemic_ft_mental/,"I am a junior illustration major with only a few quarters left. I'm not sure whether or not I should move back to my college. It's 16 hours from where I grew up in 8 hours from where I'm at now. The pandemic let me do classes online (which I very much enjoyed) and move in with my fiance I'm finally after a year and a half in a place where I enjoy and feel safe. 

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to my advisor and the head of my major in they both said that it's not an online school so I can't graduate online. Which I do understand fully but the pandemic's not over and that doesn't leave me very many options. They also announced this a week before registration. So no I couldn't have planned to head too much. 

&amp;#x200B;

Moving back would mean living on my own in a city I don't feel comfortable. I also have a dog and he's a whole different story, but he will be moving with me. I'm just not sure I can balance all of it at once. The school takes over the entire city so living there I have to be very independent since it's not a normal college campus. The quarters are pretty short, very condensed, and very hard to complete but I've been doing such a good job with these past quarters and especially online. I have problems with being in front of people and in with a group of people so online has allowed me to focus just on the school work and not on everything else that comes with on-ground classes. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is a reason I'm an illustrator looking to do freelance for the rest of my life. I can work well with people one-on-one or in small groups or teams but get me in a classroom setting with a whole bunch of people and I do not thrive. Plus the recordings and how every assignment is written down makes things super easy for me to grasp. No more miscommunications because I miss something the professor said. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mental health has been declining rapidly as of late. Recently having a large event give me (undiagnosed) PTSD. That's been making it very hard to go out in public or be around people who I don't know or trust. I've also explicitly been having nightmares every night which is making it very hard to get proper sleep. That is all on top of other conditions I do have and I don't feel the need to explain here. They all make it very hard for me to be independent, much less fully independent living on my own and being a full-time student. Moving would mean I'm leaving all of my support systems behind. Even with my current supports I've tried, or come way too close to trying, to un alive myself a few times over the pandemic. Living on my own only gives me more room to do so. And fewer reasons to hold back. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also just don't know if I need a degree in illustration. Many of the artists I look up to never got a formal degree in art and in the end, they don't hire you based on your degree. It's all about your portfolio. 

&amp;#x200B;

What does that mean I should drop out? Do I just work on all of the freelance accounts, websites, and apps that I already have been for the past years and hope that one day it'll work? Maybe illustration just isn't for me, it's more of a hobby. 

&amp;#x200B;

But then what do I tell my family? Specifically, my grandparents who are helping me through college financially. None of them care much for mental health in the slightest. And don't find it realistic for my to be struggling at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

I kept my grades really good this whole time, no matter my struggles. I'm not considering dropping out because I'm lazy or don't care. I just don't know if I can do all of this for much longer. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then was all this time and money a waste? 

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried transferring to an online school but the way that my college sets up its courses makes it so that you cannot transfer anywhere else. Effectively trapping anybody who's put in too much time and money to start all over again.

I seem to be having a hard time figuring out what to major in. I started community college when I was 17 and had just graduated high school. Back then I still had no idea what I wanted to major in. My parents really wanted me to go to college and get into a well paying career, they especially wanted me to do something in the medical field. I’m their only child so lots of pressure is on me. I tried discussing with them about taking a gap year to think this through and explore other options, but they didn’t let me. Back then not knowing better, I enrolled in some classes to become a medical assistant. I did a semester of that and I wasn’t enjoying it, so I stopped. At that point I still wasn’t sure what else to major in. I came across an early childhood program that didn’t sound too bad and decided to try it out. I thought it was okay, except it was getting to a point where apparently they required us to have some kind of ‘experience’ with kids..? Something I don’t have, and had to stop, for now at least. Right now I’m not taking any classes, just working at a job, because I feel like I was just taking classes aimlessly without not knowing what I want to do.

I’ve heard of trade schools, and in high school I took some workshop classes which I enjoyed. The only issue is that these schools are on the other side of the state and in my current home situation, I can’t move out yet. I also just turned 19. There are some nursing homes near me in need of cna and staffing, and my parents told me I should look into becoming one in the meantime.

I’m looking for some advice.

I have a class where 1/5 of the grade is class participation, which is up solely to the digression of the instruction. Knowing what I know now, I should have dropped, but I didn’t think he was as unreasonable as he is. 

The class is the easiest course in the world, but I just show up and do my work, turn in it on time or a day early.

He regularly tells the class what an “over achiever” I am, so for the group project he paired me with the two most absent people. The project went ok, but now with the project and the participation grade, I’m nervous. 

I always got the feeling that he would give me a B, for no other reason than spite. He’s extremely passive aggressive. He will only reprimand the people he doesn’t like, while ignoring the same actions from those he likes. Her implicit bias is off the charts and sadly, I’m fair sure he doesn’t like me.

To make matters worse, I tried talking to my parents about this and one of the things that bothered me was a response that, “Well a B isn’t the end of the world.” While I know he’s right, I wanted to save the B’s for courses that were actually difficult, or thing that I really couldn’t comprehend.

It’s having a negative impact on my drive and motivation. I’ve worked so hard to get A’s this semester, but if a B is something I can’t avoid, should I just be happy with B’s my other classes too?

I did want to try to get into an excellent school, which might be out of my reach no matter what. I got terrible, terrible grades the last time I went to college, so it’ll be difficult to change that.

172,PaoloMustafini,1634927083,/r/college/comments/qdn1gf/grade_appeal_advice_success/,"I won't go too much into detail about my own case but if your college/university gives you the option to appeal a grade and you feel disgruntled here are a few tips to help you maximize the chances of a successful grade change:

1) Document everything--- emails, exams, quizzes, lectures (if possible) etc.  The more evidence you have to prove your case the easier it will be. In my situation, I had a professor who had no problem lying to the committee. It wasn't just about one specific thing or small detail, they practically tried to lie about everything. For example, they tried to downplay my score on a particular midterm by claiming the exam was mostly review from a previous class. I had to pull up the file immediately, and screenshare to show them that this was a lie. And this wasn't even the worst instance of them lying unfortunately. There were other occasions where I had to do my own homework and contact Blackboard IT support preemptively to disprove one of their claims.  


2) Reach out to your classmates---Chances are that if your Professor is truly incompetent then most of your classmates are also affected by it. Reach out and see if they have evidence you don't and also if your school gives the option, see if they are willing to testify. 


3) You need to write a very compelling letter with proof to substantiate your claims----Your writing skills will need to be on point in order to get your point across efficiently. They don't need to see another frivolous appeal. ""His exam questions were hard and nothing like the hw"" is not a good argument. However, ""He cancelled classes on _______, _______, ______, and ignored all emails for the week of _____ here are the screenshots proving so"" is a much stronger argument for your case. Include as many references as possible. If you see that for example a particular violation occurred per your state's education code: make sure to include it. If your professor violated the code of conduct from their contract with the school , refer to that specific clause. etc. 

4) Be prepared for questions and any counter-argument from your Professor-- like I said, the Professors will have no issues lying to cover their tracks. Be prepared for whatever questions the committee may have and be prepared to disprove any lies claimed by your instructor. Additionally, seek help from your school from any counselors or organizations that help students in such cases.



I wanted to post a summary of what I had to go through. I know that if I had seen a post like this before going through the appeal, it would have made the whole thing much easier.

Since I was kid I was smart, grade 1-6 I was a ""excellence student"", it's a diploma in my country for those with an average of 4.5/5, I didn't study much or tried hard, I didn't even was attentive in class, I was always in my world but the day before tests I would resume everything and do well. 

Of couse after grade 6 resuming everything the day before wouldn't work so my average was 3.6/5 until grade 9, end of middle school.

Now that I am finnaly in high school I thought to myself that I would finally study and focus because now my average would be important to acomplish my dream of joining a good university in Asia.

When I was in grade 7 I decided that I would study a lot and study abroad the whole Univeristy years (Computer science) in Asia. Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Macau or Hong Kong. Why study abroad? Because I want the experience, I love meeting new people and new cultures. Why in Asia? Because I wanted a whole different culture (I live in Portugal, Europe). Why these countries? Because they have an amazing culture and are good economically and they are countries that I can see that they think in the future, and thats very important if I want live there in the future.

End of middle school this is when everything starts. I will resume a lot because I dont wanna say what were the personal problems and its so big. In the end of middle school I started having a lot of personal problems with my family etc and even my mother decided to move me to other school in other city where I knew no one because I wasn't attentive in classes on my other school.

I went to the other school and started high school, it was a school in the middle of nowhere and I hated it, I didn't adapt, I couldn't study because of the personal problems with my family, my grades were super bad  and with everything happening at the same time I got a depression and my mental health wasa very bad, after half of first year of high school my mom finally decided to move me back to my old school but again a class that I knew no one, coming after half a year with a depression, bad grades and personal problems. My grades were still bad and I didn't want to live more, I was in the dark hole seeing my dream fading away. Thats when the whole COVID thing starts and online classes are a thing now, it helped a lot to my mental health but it would be impossible to improve grades because of online school but I passed. My first year ends with bad grades and a decent mental health. The summer was decent, I had no personal problems and I was just trying to recover from my depression. My second year of high school starts with normal school, I had no motivation, my high school grades average was already ruined by my first year, but I tried, I tried studying, I tried being attentive in classes but I just wanted to stay in a dark room sleeping, my grades weren't improving, my dream was fading away, personal problems with my family were growing I was going deep, instead of recovering, I started missing school and after half a year of second year of high school I stopped going to school, I went to psychologists to help me and to justify not going to school but it didn't help, I failed second year of high school and I need to repeat it again. I lost a year in my life.

The summer started my relationship with my family improved a lot, my personal problems ended, I recovered from my depression and my mental health is good again, I started working on myself, working out, reading, taking the driving license etc. School started a month ago, I would be in my last year of high school but I am in my second year of high school with youger people that judge me or not, I don't know because I didn't go to school one day, a month after school started I am here typing this to post on reddit, I am motivated, I have a dream to study abroad next year but I can't because I can't go to school, if I go to school I need to do more 2 years and I won't be able to attend to university because of my grades average. 

Thats why I am writing this, what should I do? Coming back to normal school isn't a option and my psychologist agree. I have some options like studying in home and takes tests in school and exams etc but I didn't want to waste a whole year! I want to go to university next year like my friends!

1. I couldn’t decide on a major and didn’t want to waste money with no goal in mind. 

2. I wasn’t ready to move away from home. 

3. The cost. College is not cheap and I wasn’t accepted for any of the scholarships I applied for. 

4. COVID. Being at home for a year made me miss out on a ton of things I loved about the city, like my job. I wanted to stay to make up for it when things started opening up again. 

I was accepted to a few far away schools in my state and I turned down all of them. I was trying to think financially and responsibly smart. Moving away would only put more debt on my family than necessary and I would be fine to live at home. However, I am starting to feel the doldrums of choosing to stay local. At first, I thought it was awesome. I was hanging out with a couple friend groups, both old and new. However, they dissipated after the first month or two as the school year set in. 

I guess my current school is decent, but the student life at my school is really dead. I went through high school keeping to myself and not really participating in social events there or making many friends. I was really hoping that would flip in college. I hung out with the friend groups and attended rush events for a sorority. There aren’t many social events at all, and I’m honestly so caught up in my schoolwork and personal things it’s hard to get out and make the most of it. 

Even in my classes it’s kinda shuffle in-shuffle out type thing so I haven’t made any friends there. I’m naturally quiet and introverted. The sorority I tried to join didn’t give me a bid. I only made one solid friend. The clubs are killed off because of COVID and I’m not interested in intramural sports. I honestly wonder if I would be better off at a school known for good student life and feeling super inserted into their community. 

I had felt this way since I started thinking about college in junior year. I wanted to stay local and keep costs low. I chose the practical side over the chance of experience and now I’m regretting it.",college,I regret not moving away for college.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/qce5x3/i_regret_not_moving_away_for_college/,1634791155.0
175,Delta280,1634761496,/r/college/comments/qca2xo/wondering_if_i_should_first_year_transfer_to_ucsc/,"Hey reddit! So, I am in an interesting situation, so I guess I will start from the beginning.

So, I was in the class of 2021 in Sacramento, CA. My original goal was to go to University of Washington for their Computer Engineering program, but I discovered quickly after my rejection that it was near impossible to get accepted out of state for their program. So, I decided I would either go to UC Davis, UC Santa Cruz, or Oregon State University. At the time, I was waitlisted both at Davis and SC. Eventually, May finally rolled around, and I got off the waitlist of UCSC. I was thrilled at the time, since I had gotten denied from Berkeley, UCLA, Irvine, and Santa Barbara. However, when I was looking into the school, the fact that the major was impacted and there was a massive housing crisis scared me. It was also further than UC Davis, so I didn't know what to do. I think this was where I made my first mistake, and decided to not put a deposit down for UCSC and hope that I would get accepted into UC Davis. However, when I was visiting Oregon State, I got the rejection letter from UC Davis, and I was bummed.  When I was visiting OSU's campus, I didn't feel that magic that some people get. I thought it was average, thinking that it was similar to what I would be getting if I went to Sac State (a CSU). So, I was committed to Oregon, and now going into week 4 of my term, I'm definitely not feeling that great about it. I feel isolated from my former friends, I'm not a big fan of Corvallis (I wish it was a bigger town with more things to do), and I just feel lonely.  My classes (mostly been bacc core) have definitely felt a step back from high school. I didn't think I'd say this, but I miss the AP classes. I think that high school definitely challenged me more than OSU has so far.  If I went to UCSC, I would only be 3 hours away from home versus 8 hours, which I feel is a substantial difference and would let me go home more often, if I need to. Oregon state's campus has also been somewhat disappointing. Money is not an issue, but I feel that out of state tuition for this school doesn't justify how I feel about the school.

A big thing that I have had trouble dealing with is the fact that I tried to work very hard in high school (4.3 gpa, 3.85 unweighted), but I'm not able to go to a prestigious university. I know that everyone says it doesn't matter what college you go to, but rather the connections. While I know this, I've just had trouble dealing with it. Some people have told me that people put UCs on a pedestal when in reality they are just like any other decent university, except they are quite crowded and it's very difficult to get your required classes.

So, I was wondering if I should reapply to UCSC and/or UC Davis, and to know what my chances are of getting back in, since originally I was an in-state student, but now I am going to an out of state school. Would this make me an out of state transfer? I am still a resident of California, but I am simply at a school out of state. Also, what is the policy of first year transfers, is that even possible at UCSC, or even any UCs? Would any of my current credits at Oregon State transfer, or would I have to start from scratch if I switched to UCSC? 

Also, one big thing about Oregon State is that they have an internship program for a lot of the engineering majors called MECOP, which is aligned with university coursework to minimize the extension of time to earn a degree. While it is competitive, I think I might have a good chance if I can keep my grades up and work on some side projects for computer related stuff (coding, overclocking club, etc.). Is there an equivalent program to this at UCSC, or is it basically everyone for themselves? 

One more thing, if there was anything I left out that you guys think I should know, please let me know!

I've tried turning off my phone and putting distractions away, but even so I seem to get lost in what I'm doing quite often. It's so hard to actually focus and it takes me probably an hour or two longer than what I assume my peers are doing.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to have an adderall script despite not being formally diagnosed for ADHD. I asked my doctor if I could try it and see if it would help me and I got started on 20mg a day. I never abused the prescription, nor did I ever sell it because I was genuinely trying to turn my life around (I forgot to mention that I became addicted to drugs around the time of the pandemic as a junior in high school and it ruined my academic career). The problem is, my dad doesn't want me to take the medications and wants me to power through even if its hard or I can't get results. 

&amp;#x200B;

Compared to studying on adderall vs. not on it is a big difference. I feel much more energized, focused, and creative on it. I'm going into a STEM field, but what should I do? Bite the bullet and suffer? My other option is to obtain my prescription without my parents' knowledge, or should I just get an actual ADHD adult test? 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to reiterate that the medication has been nothing but a boon for me (as I am clean and do not abuse it) and I've had ""symptoms"" of ADHD as a child, but never got formally tested. Weirdly enough, I developed a game addiction as a child and could play and focus on games like COD for 8+ hours straight, but still struggle with school.",college,I want some advice as an STEM undergrad regarding medication.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/qbvptc/i_want_some_advice_as_an_stem_undergrad_regarding/,1634734573.0

I’m at a big state school about 3 hours from home, and I just don’t like it. I feel so alone up here, I miss my family, the amount of people here is often overwhelming. 

I don’t really have any close friends, and I don’t see myself ever making any. I’ve tried much harder than I ever have before to meet people but nothing really sticks. My roommate and I really just don’t click, we rarely talk, and it’s really hard for me living with someone that I don’t like. 

I’ve tried joining clubs to meet people and do fun things but because it’s such a big school all of the clubs have tons of people and I never really get to know anyone or necessarily see people multiple times. I’m just not the type of person who can make friends in one interaction. They’re also kind of clicky it seems. 

My school is kind of known for being the school thats students absolutely love and never want to leave, but I feel left out in this mindset. I just want to go home. If I transferred I wouldn’t even be upset about leaving, just about dealing with it. Im thinking that a smaller school closer to home would be better for me. Maybe I won’t like it there either, but at least I would be closer to home and not feel trapped.

Does anyone have an opinion or experience with this? I know people are gonna say that I haven’t tried to make the best of it, but I did everything anyone ever told me to do.

We worked hard for it and asked the professor several questions. But before turning in the assignment, one of my classmates had a doubt about a graph we did. So I asked one of my friends who had taken this class before, since she might know something, but instead she gave me the script they did. I used our data to run their script, but the answers were different. It was weird but we didn't think much of it and didn't change anything on our script.

The thing is that at the moment of submitting the script, I wrongfully submitted my friend's script. I didn't realise that until the professor talked to me yesterday.

She started by saying that she had already reported us since we turned in someome else's work. I immediately knew that I messed things up, so I tried to explain that we just used that script to test something we weren't sure about and that our script was completely different. Thankfully, she asked me to send her our script. But when I asked her what would happen to us (since we've been already reported), she said that we'd be dropped off from class or get a 0 for this assignment. She added that we should wait and don't withdraw from this class (idk whether she was caring for us or she wouldn't be able to punish us if we withdrew).

I'm really afraid of getting an academic sanction since I have very good grades and I'm trying to get into a prestigious grad school next year. So, I wrote an appoligizing letter to her today.

There are still somethings that favor us:
- the 2 scripts are very different (there are parts that look similar, since they were either on the scripts used in class or found online)
- we sent a mail asking several questions (with a screenshot included), and what the professor answered were well incorporated in our script
- given the same data, the answer on both scripts are different
- we didn't put our names or anything like that on my friend's script (so that's not appropiation or plagiarism)
- I sent our script to the professor right there, so there was no time to edit 

I'm really afraid how this is going to turn out, she said that she would speak to us again on Friday about the final decisions. What do you think this will turn out? I'm not sure how strict is my university about this, but I know some cases that were solved between the professor and the student by just giving a lower mark (they didn't report the student).

181,Altaccount783,1633647534,/r/college/comments/q3kuka/what_to_do_about_students_talking_behind/,"So I'm in a bit of a conundrum here and would appreciate some advice on how to handle this and what I can do to alleviate this situation. 

I am a grad student at university, taking an online combined section course (with both undergrads and grad students). Its a lecture course btw. 

Anyway, I want to preface this that I have taken this professor before in undergrad, and respect them a lot. They are fairly considerate, very open to questions and concerns, as well as very flexible (they provide extensions to those that need them). This professor also just came back after taking off a year from university, so now they have to adjust to teaching online class--which is understandable because lots of people have had to do it. 

This all started when one student in particular (lets call them ""A"") made a chat for everyone in the class to join, to ask questions or discuss course material. 

Which was fine by me, I decided to join because, well why not. This was at the start of the semester, and the only time I engaged was when one classmate asked when an assignment would be up, and I responded in turn. 

I left the chat for about three weeks, decided to check in, and saw the shit-talking that ensued while I was offline. The student ""A"" had started complaining that the professor wasn't teaching clearly enough, that they didn't understand the questions asked during lectures and said they were too ""vague."" They also got angry about some mistakes the professor made with the schedules as well as some assignment due dates (which were all resolved--the professor sent out frequent email updates as well as extended due dates). 

Which, I understand because I was also in that situation before. However, I didn't go to my friends or my classmates and complain and whine about it to them, even as an undergrad. I just sent emails out to the professor about it, and spoke privately about it with them. 

So that's where the issue lies. As soon as ""A"" began talking smack about the class, the professor's teaching, etc other students (mostly undergrads--there's only 3 of us grad students in the course) all piled on, complaining, whining, making off-topic statements like ""this class is stupid"". 

""A"" also tends to take screenshots of their conversations with the professor and puts them in the chat, followed up by an offhand comment about how the professor perhaps ""shouldn't be teaching online classes"". 

The only reason why I am asking now what I should do about this is because I left the chat again (I took screenshots and saved all the messages on a word document) and I logged in today to find that ""A"" is on the rampage again, saying they will send letters to the dean with complaints about the professor, that they cannot teach the course properly, that they don't communicate well (which is bullshit because the professor is doing one on one meetings for the next few weeks) and that apparently the professor makes too many mistakes with the schedule. 

And there are about 2-3 students (who I have noticed are the only ones that engage in the chat) who are backing ""A"" up, saying ""I hate this class"" or ""I hate (the professor)"" as well as using profanity-laden statements about the course, the professor, among other things that have nothing to do with the class material.

At this point I've realized I have come across a Karen student, who is taking really small things out of proportion, because like I said, even as an undergrad if I had complaints I went to the professor--which 99% of the time resolved things. Also, this is an online course, where lectures are recorded, and students can use notes and the readings to take quizzes, etc. And they are complaining that the professor's lectures don't coincide with the questions in the quizzes, which, if they actually do the readings they will find that most (if not all) the answers are in the readings. The lectures are for discussion over the texts as well as the specific topic for the week. 

I noticed in chat one of the other grad students (let's call them ""B"") has tried to talk to them, reassuring them that no, the professor is not there to set you up for failure, to ask questions to the professor if they don't understand, etc. But at this point its escalated to where this one student is apparently so angered by the professor that they just want to complain to the dean than actually discuss these issues with the professor (DESPITE the professor talking about this in lecture today, they told students  if they have questions to contact them, to use class time to discuss things, etc). And this student, ""A"" has now formed a small clique where several of the other students just agree with them. 

Again, I originally joined this chat thinking it was going to be basic advice, q&amp;a discussions about the class material, helping with notes, etc. Not a huge gossip-fest about the professor and how hard the class is (which could be improved if students followed the class schedule and did their readings--even skimming them would help them). 

I am very tired of this nonsense, and it feels like kids who haven't grown out of high school. To be fair, yes they're in undergrad so there's still room to learn, but that shouldn't matter. I've met undergrad students who are far more mature than this. I can understand if someone is having trouble with the class because of a medical condition, or they have to take care of family at home, even if they have an intense job or something. At the same time, you can handle these things privately and talk to the professor about it---I've taken this professor before and they are flexible especially now that we're in a pandemic.

At this point I don't know what I should do. Should I just leave the chat for good and just not engage? Should I tell them that maybe they're being too harsh and to remember the professor is a human being too? Should I give them advice on how to take notes, improve their study-habits? Should I ask a fellow grad student for advice? Should I report this to the professor, so that they are aware what ""A"" is saying and what other students are saying about them? 

I think the professor is aware the students are saying these things--they've mentioned it in one or two lectures that students have come to them with problems--but the professor is actively trying to fix it and sends out weekly emails (sometimes more than once) regarding due dates, meeting times, even scheduling one on one meetings like I mentioned above. 

I'd appreciate any advice on how to handle this. I just--maybe I'm biased because I had this professor before, but I can't stand to see when students complain and whine about things that they can very well solve on their own and discuss individually with the professor about. I would think that in an upper level, junior/senior level course in university students would know by now to do these things.",college,What to do about students talking behind professor's back,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/q3kuka/what_to_do_about_students_talking_behind/,1633665534.0

I never fully realized how much of a hermit I really am until college. When I go to class, I actively avoid talking to people. In more intimate classes, sure, if I have to, and you would never guess that I dislike it. 
It absolutely boggles me that people actively seek out friendships in school. I just genuinely cannot understand why everyone other than me is so desperate to find someone to cling to. It doesn't make me feel bad, or like I'm missing anything. I almost feel like other people are lacking something, I guess? I hope that doesn't come across as narcissistic. I have tried my hand at making friends, and it's gone well, but I just don't understand what the benefit is in maintaining that. Building relationships just, like, isn't worth the effort.
I always tell people that I'm here to get my degree and get excited about my career. If I wasn't an academic at heart, I wouldn't be here. The response is always, ""okay, well don't study too hard!"" And I can't help but think that's the point? I genuinely enjoy studying and stuff, and it's just not a justified investment to joint clubs, make friends and stuff.
I know I'll have to network more once I declare my major (and yes, I have already done my fair share), and I will, but none of this superficial stuff matters to me. 
I'd appreciate hearing from anyone else who feels this way.

i really havent had a solid friend group since middle school. i spent high school trying to become fully myself, and consequently ended up never having consistant, satisfying friendships. i spent my time drifting. there were people who liked me, sure--i made it my goal to be kind to everyone and make them feel comfortable around me, because i was so used to being uncomfortable around others-- but, they also forgot about me, or chose not to include me. even the person who told me i was their best friend hardly invited me to spend time with them outside of school. it felt like i was never anyones first pick. 

when i would talk to my mom, sister, therapist, anyone about it, they would all tell me similar things: you live in a small town with a limited number of people, when you go to college, you will find so many people to be great friends with. so i settled for just getting by in hs, even if i was lonely most of the time.

i was pretty excited to move to college, considering this hope that i would finally have good people as friends after 4 years of nothing. 

but when i got here, i was hit pretty quickly with the reality that people arent interested in being friends with random people. no one cares if you are sitting alone in the cafeteria, or walking alone around campus; no one is going to notice that you are lonely and start a friendship out of the blue. i didn't connect with anyone for a full 4 days after i moved in. i forced myself to get someone's contact info once, and they are still the only friend i have. and it isn't as if i hide in my dorm; i go about my life just like everyone else. my friend said they were also very lonely, but they not only have a sibling on campus, but have friends from high school here too. i dont. i know one person from hs and they arent interested in spending time with me. 

when i re-asked my mom, sister, therapist what to do now, they all say that even if it's hard, i need to seek out groups that im interested in and i will meet my people there. so ive tried. and there are so many times when i want to speak but i freeze up, or i blank, or i think about it too long and miss my chance. but once again, no one shows interest in me as a human. and i cant help but feel that if i have to keep initiating a connection, i am just forcing people to talk to me. i can ask for information all i want, but if im the only one reaching out, they really dont want a connection with me, they're just being a nice person. 

my friend has invited me to go along with them and their other friends for eating or going out, but even then, their attention is on the other people, and i am so uncomfortable. any time i speak, i feel so annoying. there are times when i begin to try to act like the other people, instead of being myself, in hopes of getting a little attention from the group, but i become so exhausted and upset that i have to change to feel liked. i have to spend the whole time internally soothing myself and trying to rationalize why im not being talked to, or looked at, or heard, or walked next to, or whatever. i have to constantly convince myself that what i said wasnt annoying, or convince myself not to say something i would normally say because i know this group of people wont be interested. i think some people might say that if i am so lonely i should take any connection i can get, but dont i deserve a meaningful friend? dont i deserve to have a person just like everyone else? 

i really dont know what to do anymore. i feel like im incapable of talking to anyone. i feel like there must be something off-putting about me that people avoid connecting with me. am i just never going to have real friends? my mom doesnt have any friends, am i going to be like her? am i going to constantly be a second pick, someone forgotten and left out for the rest of my life? it hurts and i dont know how much longer i can keep struggling with this.

194,Proper-Captain-5873,1630990638,/r/college/comments/pjg9p6/cant_stand_this_anymore/,"I am literally at my wits end right now...

2 years ago I was in 12th grade. I was a straight A+ student with a strong work ethic. I also had a great reputation among fellow students and teachers as a hard-working and hilarious person. Everyone believed that I would be successful after high school, and so did I myself. After all, I had grown and improved so much during my 4 years of secondary education, I was right on track for success.

Unfortunately, things did not go as intended.

While everyone else in my grade was passionate about a certain field and knew for certain what they wanted to get into, I had absolutely no idea of what I wanted to do in post-secondary. It didn't help that I was dealing with a terrible situation during the first semester of twelfth grade, thus I didn't have the time to properly research programs.

Knowing how unsure I was, I wanted to take a gap year to have enough time to get my shit together, volunteer, plan, and most importantly, figure out what I wanted to do in life. My parents denied me harshly. I explained my reasoning and plan to them, but they doubled down, claiming I would ""lose my study habits"" and ""be lazy"". I ended up picking a program that i thought roughly aligned with my interests just to fend them off.

Now... my parents.

My folks (especially my dad) are the typical overbearing tiger parents who push me too far and are overly authoritarian. Throughout most of my life, I kept my school life completely separate from my home life in order to be more myself and thrive without the overbearing reach of my toxic family dynamic. If it weren't for this ""system"" of mine, I wouldn't have been able to achieve the success I had academically.

Seeing that uni had the option to live in residence, I saw this as an opportunity to escape this toxic hellscape and develop properly as an independent adult. My parents denied this too. I was disgruntled, but this I understood because it came from a financial concern (I also happen to live in the same city as my university).

Luckily, I had a Plan B: spend as much time as campus as possible. My intention was to use up all of my waking hours on lectures and on the campus library to study while only using home as a place to sleep, therefore allowing me to keep that ""barrier of separation"" between my family and school life.

But then Covid came along...

No big deal, at least it will end in just a few months... Right?

It continued on into September 2020, even stronger than ever.

No longer could I employ my plan B, as all classes were now done online. Worst of all, I had to do them FROM HOME, the very environment I wanted to be liberated from when I went into post-secondary. It didn't help that e-class was more demanding than the traditional in-person counterpart, in terms of workload and discipline.

From this moment on my life fell apart.

I wasn't able to contribute to the class and open up to new people as much as I used to, as there was always the risk my parents would overhear me and criticize me for everything that I say. My ability to concentrate and focus deteriorated greatly, as e-class just ain't engaging enough as it would have been in an actual lecture hall.

One of my goals for post-secondary was to join as many extracurriculars as possible and build a strong network of people/connections.

Considering the circumstances, that ended up not happening. 

Things just kept degrading from here. I realized that my program wasn't really my thing, and wanted to transfer out to another one that would be better suited for my interests. My parents yet again denied this and wanted me to finish all 4 years of this one. Unbelievable.

The more I tried to study from home, the harder it got. Constant arguing between my parents and berating from my dad just made me more anxious and tense. I did everything possible to improve my work ethic, using the Pomodoro method and even a planner, but to absolutely no avail. The workload just kept increasing while my drive went down the drain.

For a moment, my small semblance of escape was to use my local library to study, but then I remembered that even this place was closed for Covid.

More shit from home came my way and I wasn't able to deal with it. I became a bitter, cynical person who hated everything around me. My grades went down and I officially lost my academic streak. I wasn't able to ""just get help"" by seeing a therapist or psychiatrist, because my parents would overhear my conversations with them considering that I didn't have a ""safe and confidential"" space at home.

I thought that maybe Covid would end by the start of 2021. Boy was I wrong.

Second semester was even worse. After four months of drowning in a toxic hellhole, I failed the term. My parents were absolutely furious and retaliating by becoming even more authoritarian and controlling over me. 

At this point, I had officially lost hope.

The year in which I was supposed to discover myself and explore new worlds turned out to destroy me in more ways than I could ever imagine.

Instead of enjoying the perks of uni life, I reached echelons of depression and despair no human being should ever have the misfortune of reaching.

Instead of growing as a person, my values and morality were degraded well past the point of no return.

Instead of becoming strong-minded and confident, I became extremely emotionally unstable and nearly broke into insanity.

Instead of gaining freedom, I ended up far more trapped than I ever was in my life.

I can't keep living like this anymore. I wanted to become a successful, wholesome and happy human being, not this husk of a person that just trudges on without hope.

This year has left a scar on me so great I'm not sure I'll be able to come back from this and become the best version of me I can become. I feel just as broken and destroyed as Rotterdam during WWII.

In a few days, I repeat my first year of uni in the same program, STILL ONLINE. At the very least my local library is open this time, hence I can do it away from my toxic home...

Sadly, I don't care anymore. All dreams and aspirations have finally been sucked away by this terrible virus. I might as well just disappear off society to avoid further pain or degradation.

I'm currently enrolled at Columbus State Community College. I hope to transfer to Ohio State University if/once I earn an Associate degree in pursuit of a Chemical Engineering Bachelor's degree/career. But I am not enrolled in any classes yet because I don't see how I can afford it. And again, I'm at a community college. Tuition is not the issue here. It's living expenses. I need to come up with about $1500 a month, pure cash. I wish it could be less, but I have a mother/family to support. But here's the thing, I thought that was a lot, but according to The College Board, that's ""moderate spending"" in the 2016-2017 academic year.

https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/2016-07-05/estimate-living-expenses-to-determine-college-affordability

A job could cover that, and I have one. Hence how I'm able to support my family right now. But the time a job takes prevents me from going to school. Even if I could somehow schedule my shifts so that I had time to go to class, my academic advisor explains that 1 credit hour of class comes out to 3 hours per week outside of class, studying and doing homework and the like. 

https://www.aic.edu/academics/credit-hours-calculator/

At LEAST. This is an especially hard rule for engineering students, which I am/hope to be. So going from class to work with only an hour between wouldn't leave me enough time to get my coursework done.

But there are full time engineering students. Lots of them. And they don't all come from rich families. So how are they affording their living expenses if they aren't working full time? My academic advisor didn't know. So she referred me to a financial aid advisor. She told me the financial aid advisor could advise me on the proper pursuit of full-time studenthood. 

We must not understand what a ""financial aid advisor"" does. Because this financial aid advisor was fucking useless as far as that. What she did know was how to say ""Have you accepted your reward package yet?"" I explained to her that the reward package alone isn't enough to cover school + living expenses, and I needed to know, based on her wisdom and what she's seen of other students and how this tends to work out, what the wise steps to take are if I'm looking to cover what The College Board alleges are moderately typical expenses. If these expenses are so typical, I'm assuming she as an advisor has seen many students in this situation, who need to cough up this kind of money, and did somehow cough up that kind of money. But no, she knew dick outside of what everyone already knows about the financial aid process. I know what a federal loan is, I know what its limits are. Obviously gambling on scholarships is of no use to me if I need money right now. Not in March of 2022. So she says ""Well, you could take out private loans..."" And I'm like ""Is that wise?"" And she's like ""No, no loan is wise."" So can this just not be done??? She, whose job I assumed was advising about a tenable path to paying for college, is giving me advice and then immediately following it up with ""That's bad advice by the way. I don't know what to tell you.""

The closest thing to valuable advice I could find was on Reddit. r/CSCC is a ghost town. r/OSU has mostly suggested things that only apply if I'm an actual student at Ohio State. Some have suggested part time work, but are there really jobs out there that are so part time that I can go to school full time AND do all my homework AND all of my labs/group projects AND study AND go to work? The College Board says people are doing it. But I can't find a job like that. People say ""Get a part time job as a waiter. The hours are short &amp; flexible, and the tips are plenty."" But you can't just get a job as a waiter. I've tried. It takes training before they make you a waiter and I need wait staff money now. I can't support my family without it. And that's if they even give you a chance. In Columbus especially they talk a big game about how desperate they are for wait staff &amp; other restaurant staff. But the only place that didn't turn me away because they're ""not looking to train someone new"" offered me a door job that averages only $40 in tips a night. If I worked every night I would be barely scraping half of what I need. I appreciate them being honest with me though.

I need to talk to someone who's done this. So I can follow their example. Crunch the numbers as might, it just don't add up. Everyone warns me, Chemical Engineering, or any engineering at all, is a dreadful undertaking. My academic advisor expressly warned me against pursuing an engineering degree while working full time. So where are engineering students getting money for food and rent if they're busy with schoolwork all the time??? What part time jobs are covering their living expenses? Can I have one of those jobs???

Hope is waning. I have a CLEP test coming up, but I'm losing motivation. Grip on integral calculus and logarithmic functions loosening.

I’ve spent countless hours in her office and I really look up to her. Im in my final semester and am doing a research project with her. However, we were supposed to do this project over the summer. 

I contacted her weekly asking when she was free, what I should be doing to prepare, and what I should expect for the work. The only reply I’ve had is asking for my schedule. I’ve replied five times that my schedule is completely free.  I’ve never gotten a reply. I’ve tried to pry more but have been unable to contact her.

First day after summer break I go to her office and ask her the same above questions. She again asks for my schedule. This happens three more times in the next five days.

If I'm being 100% honest, I don't really have a passion for this field at all.

Probably the most advanced stuff I can do, to give yall a gauge of my skill level, is a simple PEMDAS problem, or a simple ""Get X onto one side"" equation.

So, I signed up for College Algebra this semester expecting it to be hard but it's not simply ""hard"": I realized I don't even know the very foundations of what they're talking about. I don't know what a coefficient is. I don't know what a *leading* coefficient is. I don't know what a prime number is. I didn't know what that giant check mark box (which I now know is a radical sign) is. I don't know what an integer is, or a solution set. I have no idea what they meant by FOIL, which they presupposed I knew. It all sounds like a foreign language to me.

So, as you can guess, I got demolished on basically the first day, lol.

I talked with my math professor, as well as an academic advisor, and basically hit a brick wall in regards to what they were telling me.

Here's the short of it: She seems to have said that College Algebra is going to require knowledge from 2 courses: DMAT 0305 and DMAT 0307 (DMAT stands for developmental math in my school system)

I'd be perfectly content to take DMAT 0305 and DMAT 0307, but frankly my family would be mad after seeing a schedule that looks like this:

* Fall 2021 - BIOL 1
* Spring 2022 - BIOL 2, DMAT 0305
* Fall 2022 - DMAT 0307 and nothing else
* Spring 2023 - College Algebra

I'm not interested in working during these times; I think this is a little overkill for trying to get 3 classes done. I want to complete my courses so I can go to university and continue on with my microbiology degree; not take a year and a half working at a job tangentially related to my major while I take a single course per semester. And I guess I can safely assume that they aint gonna offer no remedial math courses at a university, so it's not like I can transfer now so I can DMAT with the rest of my courses.

Since DMAT courses are filled and closed off for this semester how can I begin to learn math now so that I don't have to wait basically a year and a half to finish off a single course? (And I have thought about summer/winter courses, and tried them, but they are more suited for non-STEM courses, and DMAT doesn't even appear to be offered during them anyways)

Will Khan Academy suffice? If so, and with knowledge of my current skill above, what course pattern should I take? Pre-Algebrea -&gt; Algebra Basics -&gt; Algebra 1 -&gt; Algebra 2? A combination of multiple programs?

I've got no other courses besides BIOL this semester, so I can easily study math multiple hours a day. The same for this upcoming summer.

199,thebulletinaction,1630103101,/r/college/comments/pcxktr/transferred_to_a_different_college_and_dont_know/,"Hi all,

To give some quick backstory, I graduated in 2019 and was accepted and attended the University of Michigan. What nobody had told me, however, was that pretty much 40% of my scholarship was based on need-based aid, something that fluctuated based on my EFC and my FAFSA. So off I went into freshman year, having the time of my life and getting everything out of college that I desired. Michigan was a perfect school for me in every stretch of the word. Big campus, great studies, amazing social life, loved Ann Arbor, had great friends, you know the jist.

Well, then covid hit, and as I was rounding the corner into my sophomore year, I had lost my need-based scholarship that had sent my out of pocket costs from $6,000 a year to $27,000 a year. However, due to the pandemic, they processed my aid very late, and as a result, I had figured out I could not afford my second year mere DAYS before I started my second year, so I was thrown into a gap year.

If you're a middle class student, I'm sure you're aware with how unfairly you are treated within the American Education System. Too rich for financial aid, too poor for out of pocket. Transferring out of state was impossible, so to say, and even if I did get into another great school, that EFC was going to fuck me over at one point, so it wasn't even worth it if I had to find out I had to transfer again.

So, locked within my home state of Kentucky, I looked for potential transfer schools. I was a CS student at the time, but through Michigan I was achieving the major WITHOUT going through the school of engineering. However, looking at my big state schools, they only had offered CS through engineering. That was a big nope for me. I switched majors to my other passion, Music Technology.

I then applied to a very small private, Catholic college in my city that offered the program, and I was accepted with pretty good financial aid. This financial aid is merit-based, and so it is permanent. I'm working at FedEx, and I will be able to use the tuition reimbursement to pay off my federal loans from the jump. I will also be living off campus with my best friends. And I will be chasing my dreams of becoming a performer. It's definitely not all bad, but now I'm going to talk about the bad.

I feel like an outcast on this campus. I'm not religious at all, and a lot of the people here I don't relate to at all. It has an undergrad population of about 2,500, and the campus is tiny. It doesn't feel like much is going on here. I tried to be proactive and look for clubs and activities to join. I'm not joking when I say there isn't anything except for environmental stuff and some club sports. I also hate commuting, and I feel like I miss out on many events because many of the stuff is word of mouth. And the social events just feel... forced, too. Overall, it is NOTHING like my old school, and the big state experience fits my personality better than this school ever will.

I guess if I had to summarize it, from a logistics standpoint it checks all my boxes, and I made best with the shitty hand I was dealt. But from an emotional and social standpoint, it makes me feel upset and trapped. Does anyone have any advice? I was maybe thinking about transferring again, but honestly I feel like I should just bite the bullet and make-do.

But it's so hard to not compare this new life with the one my old friends are still living, and the one that I physically can't live any longer. I don't want to have a bad college experience. Maybe it just takes some adjusting?",college,Transferred to a different college and don't know how to feel.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/pcxktr/transferred_to_a_different_college_and_dont_know/,1630121101.0
200,SleepySheepHerder,1629996188,/r/college/comments/pc3bni/help_out_a_college_drop_out_get_his_self_together/,"Hello friends 

So I need some guidance.  I am a 30, a veteran of the US military.  I have completed a 2 year associates in applied science in electronic engineering tech degree at a community College in North Carolina.  I went to a University in North Carolina and went into a Engineering Technology degree.  I completed 2 semesters worth of classes before I dropped out.  The classes got to hard, the math always gave me trouble, I never figured out how to basically put everything into the calculator for me.  Then life happens, got married, kid, work, business moved out of NC to Virginia Beach area. 

I want to finish my bachelor's degree in something.  Engineering type degree would be too hard I think at this point in time.  Idk if I could really give it the hours of study I need to be able to complete a degree.  I currently work for the power company on power lines and other high voltage equipment.  I personally do not know any degrees that deal with this industry other than electrical engineering.  So a tech degree, communications, English and whatever as long as I can complete my bachelor's.  

I am currently not affiliated with any college. So I have no academic counselor I can talk to and the ones I had in the past basically tried to shove me wherever they could so I would stop emailing them.  I have looked at Old Dominion University, American Military University, Liberty University, Purdue Global.  I would prefer all online I have no real interest on being on campus unless I have to. 

I know some of these 'only online' colleges accreditation is pretty lacking.  I guess some employers care if it's accredited I have heard others just want you to have a bachelor's and accreditation seems to be an after thought.  So I really don't know if it matters that much at my level that the accreditation is very high or not. 

I have 2-3 semester left on 9/11 G.I. Bill to pay for school.  After that I will use whatever means to pay for school.  If whoever is reading this happens to know of a good way to get someone else to pay for my college like veteran or adult learner grant/scholarship/programs work part time for Walmart since they pay for some degrees now plz share a link or that info. 

So if you have colleges that are more suitable for veterans or know of certain programs that a designed for adults/veterans that I can transfer my credits into so I can use as many of the credits I already have to use, plz share.  I would hope to finish the degree in 1-2 years if possible but if it takes longer I'm willing to commit. 

Thank you for reading this far, I know it is a long post. I appreciate any advice or encouragement. 

TL;DR 
If you had a similar experience with your degree path or can suggest a path to finishing my degree, college, field of study.  Basically any guidance to a 30 year old veteran that needs some direction because all the information I look into takes me into rabbit holes that provide lots of info but do not tell me that the program is a good fit for me.  plz share any info/guidance.",college,Help out a college drop out get his self together.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/pc3bni/help_out_a_college_drop_out_get_his_self_together/,1630014188.0
201,msgmeyourcatsnudes,1629143294,/r/college/comments/p5nl6j/if_you_had_a_crazy_schedule_would_you_take/,"So I have a pretty crazy schedule. Three part time jobs (about equal to 40 hours a week), and I’m damn close to transferring from community college to university.

All I need now is Chem 1a, molecular bio, stats, and social studies. I got into bio and I’m first on the waiting list for chem, so I think I’ll get it.

Chemistry was a hard subject for me. I wasn’t able to take it in high school, so my first experience with it was taking an introductory course last summer. It kicked my ass but I got a B. I then tried taking chem 1a this last semester, but my work deliberately mislead me about my schedule expectations, so I had to drop halfway through. I also tried biology before that, but I dropped that one the first week since it was apparent that the instructor was not prepared to teach online.

This time I was smart and checked ratemyprofessor. The chem teacher has great reviews, but the bio teacher is so/so.

202,forLovelyDoubts,1629117157,/r/college/comments/p5f4yd/feeling_excluded_at_college_only_wanted_to_get/,"Well I joined my journalism college like, 1 or 2 weeks after it started because of problems in my record. The 1st interaction I had with classmates apart from seeing their names on online class was the 1st time I joined discord. They were playing never have I ever and I kinda panicked bcause when it came to my turn I didn't knew what to say and just said smtg like ""nah guys, jump me idk what to say"". I was kinda stuck at first and thought but I earned people sympathy after I appeared with a blonde wig on discord and then I got my nickname by people. 

The ""most popular people"" group there are our friends, they're movie lovers and gamers, at the same time they're kinda party crazies charismatic extroverts that have the magical skill of making anything that comes out of their mouths a funny as fuck quotable one liner. I'm very introvert and shy so I kinda stuck to get along and I keep silent on discord and stuff. At our discord roles me and some other like 4 dudes have the 2nd biggest role there, the group of the popular dudes have around 10 people and all of them have the biggest Admin role at discord and stuff.

I mean, idk, it just seems that although I can get along with people I just, idk, sometimes I feel like a ghost. I'm very quiet and dunno what to say majority of times, people don't usually include me on talks, when selecting groups to make the college works I'm always the one no one chooses... I mean, they invite me sometimes to play some games with them and when I'm with my confidence high (like 4 days ago) we have a nice flow and I get along pretty well and they laugh at my jokes and I show myself confident and it seems to work, but since I have self steem and confidence problems it's not every single time I'm like that, in general...

I had to fight the last school work we had because people were matching groups and was asked to join one that they were still adjusting and finding people to join. I said fine and then like, after days, just 2 hours before we had to deliver the work to the teacher I realized we hadn't even created a whatsapp group to talk, I found it weird and texted the girl that was organizing the group (she's one of the people with the same role as me in discord), and then she just replies me ""Oh, we made another group"". She didn't even told the dudes she made another group with other people... I had to make ASAP a group with another new dude and we did the work in 2 hours and it was fine. Even this new dude that made work with me, that's shy just like me and introvert just like me seems to be getting along better with them, since it seems that they invite him to do stuff and play and joke with him much more times than me... I confess I get jealous as fuck, I mean, what we do have different that they pick this introvert to be close friends with and not me? why not with me? Or better, why simply not include both? ,\_,

Right now the same fucking thing happened, the teacher asked us last week to match groups to our ""game creation classes"" homework and whenever I asked our popular friend they'd say ""Oh sorry dude, we're already full"" and stuff, So I needed to find another group, and I ended up again on the same group as the same girl from the other work and other dude (he's popular but like, the least popular from the popular ones so he sometimes isn't invited to work groups too). We were DM sharing ideas of what we could create in the game, but didn't created any group to discuss and stuff. Now we had to give to the teacher our group with the students name, and I notice both of this dudes had joined other groups, leaving me alone without knowing... again...

I mean, I already showed myself to be a valuable person, I'm a good video editor one of the best in class, very creative and innovatide dude, the teachers sympathize with me a lot, I'm a dude that writes texts pretty well, I'm intelligent and often get high grades, I'm a musician and self-taught learned lots of other instruments, I workout at the gym and eat well, I dress very well, I'm friendly and loyal, I'm a team player and have a lot of interest in movies, discussing politics, reading, hearing music and have hobbies like collecting car miniatures, my closest friends say they're grateful that I appeared on their lives because I'm very special to them, so I mean... Whenever I read self-improvement posts here at reddit, people tell to show yourself valuable and friendly... but idk, it doesn't seems to work with me?

Lastly I have a little story: I was in love with a shy as fuck girl that studied in my school and we were pretty good friends. Inspired by me she said she'd join the same college and subject as me because she wanted to already have a friend there and stuff, she always told me how cool it would be to study with a person she liked and stuff. Someday she even invited me to go to her house and sleep, I was feeling pretty good. Well, exactly after both of us joined college class together she stopped talking to me, literally, she don't read my messages anymore and don't even call me, it's been almost 7 months we don't talk, and I don't have a fucking clue why she's like that... Yet, she's more popular than me... And she does literally nothing, she don't join our discord calls, some of the popular boys tried hit on her but she turned them down, and she's still introvert... YET PEOPLE SEEM TO LIKE HER MORE THAN ME

I got pretty sad because at school/high school wasn't like that, I was fondly remembered at school, even though my friends were insensitive assholes I liked them, they were cool and wanted me around to do stuff with them and they realized the value I had, I was welcomed there and felt special, I felt I had a real role there, I was important. Now at college it seems everything kinda out of place... without friends neither girlfriend...

I am infuriated, frustrated, but more than anything I am in a MAJOR panic financially as this could destroy me. I am VERY low income but I am fighting to complete my master's degree and improve my quality of life.

Through undergrad I never really did the summer thing, but I ALWAYS knew the requirements for summer course loads are different than regular semester loads. For example, my friend's uni has a 4 credit minimum for full time enrollment for summer. Apparently, my school is the same for all semester. so 12 credit minimum to be considered full time, even in the summer (yikes..)   


Apparently as well, to get aid from FAFSA, you need a minimum of 5 credits. I did not know this. I tried digging around to find this information on my school's website, and it's legit just not there and the information is very difficult to find. I had to search on the .gov website to find the info.   


long story short, I enrolled for a summer course. Financial aid never said anything to me. I enrolled, applied for aid, was granted aid. half way through summer course I'm like where the flip is my aid? I reach out to them to ask what the hold up is (delays have been common especially since covid) and then they inform me because my class is only worth 4 credits, I do not qualify for aid and it is too late to drop the course and now I can pay the full 5k and keep the course going, or drop it and pay a % of the tuition cost. (roughly 3,000) W.T.F!? Had I know about the 5 credit minimum I would not have enrolled into summer courses, ESPECIALLY because for my degree only one 4 credit course was even available. I am trying to petition but they're saying I have to be mentally ill or sick, or have a death in the family and prove to them this to get the refund for extenuating circumstances. I did that, showing meds I have, a divorce I went through (even those it's not even the reason but whatever I cant afford the fee they're trying to give me) but I don't think anything I submitted qualified as the timing of my divorce and my meds/depression was a month or two prior to the start of summer semester.   


Does anyone feel this is off at all? Shouldn't financial aid have reached out to me sooner to warn me BEFORE the deadline that I don't qualify for student aid?

I got into my dream school that I wanted to attend and I was over the moon about it. I talked about the university almost all of high school and my peers knew that was the school that I wanted to attend. The school held a informational meeting in my city and my parents went with me. My dad was more so excited for me than my mom. The problem is that my mother would not allow me to go to the school. She wanted me to go to a school that her coworker and her best friend daughters attend. A lot of people in her job system are also alumni from the school. I have never had an interest for the school whenever I was on campus. I never felt “at home” or ever felt like that’s the place I can call my school/home for the next few years. I started my freshman year the fall of 2019. My first semester was rough. Being raised extremely sheltered and being away from home was a lot for me. I also had a roommate that had issues of her own that resulted in her having a really bad breakdown at 4am, which was very traumatic to see as a freshman. I’ve tried to talk to my dad, family, on campus counciling etc. about this issue and everyone says to just transfer. That’s easier said than done. The main issue is my mom. Every time I mention transferring she gets defensive and angry. I can’t even change my major without her getting upset. Before college started, I was debating on going to the major university in my city and she would get angry and say that I couldn’t go to the university near me. I just want to transfer. I left my sophomore year mid pandemic and it was extremely rough but I saw it on the plus side because I didn’t have to be on campus. Even thinking about going on campus and being in the city makes me angry. I know it’s ridiculous but her mentioning anything about the school, even little things about dorm designs, makes me unbelievably angry. I'm just angry because the school is obviously not for me and I am a junior now and I feel like i've wasted my college experience already. I have bad social anxiety which as made it hard for me to meet friends and the friends that i've made have all transferred out or moved back home. It's gotten to the point where I completely have given up on school and I no longer care about assignments. I've never not cared about turning in assignments and failing test. What should I do?

I’m currently sitting in bed, trying to touch up my resume and all I can think to myself is “What the hell am I doing?”. I’m 20 years old, virtually no work/job experience at all, I WAS a full-time college student straight out of High School and still living at home. I had already took a gap year thanks to COVID, I tried to get back into school full-time this spring, and it didn’t work out, my GPA was a 1.8. I can’t be the only one feeling miserable and like life is headed nowhere? I so badly want to work, but I’m forced to go to school full-time in order to live at home (not for free). I make extra money on the side doing different things, but the only real job I had was at McDonalds, for only 1 month because COVID also cut that short. I can’t focus on school from home anymore, it’s so depressing and incredibly hard to focus. I so badly want to work on my resume since school isn’t working out for me. I’m going to start volunteering at an animal shelter soon (Don’t know how my parents and family will feel about that), I want to look for work and join a program to become a dental assistant/RDA in the meantime, it’s only on the weekends. My situation is just a tad bit more complex than I can say, but I just really want to find work and expand my resume, and possibly take another gap year, or just reduce my school to part-time in order to do something that I really want.

Long story short: I’m unmotivated and feeling depressed since covid has ruined school and work for me. Once a happy full-time student turned to a couch potato because I’m eager to start working and making money and actually doing something useful.

I have now committed to transfer to a different university much farther from my home and as the date slowly approaches, I’m really having second thoughts of going. I withdrew in my freshman year because I didn’t like the environment and I had a really hard time making friends. As a person who struggles with some social anxiety, I tried really hard to put myself out there. I had one friend from high school but no other friendships stuck. I was also extremely homesick as well but I know that will go away eventually.

Now that I’m moving much farther away from home, I’m terrified of making new friends. I recently was offered a lease for housing, really hit it off with some potential roommates, only to find out that they wanted to keep looking for someone “better.” This really took a blow to my self esteem because everything seemed super promising. I can’t tell if it’s me or something else. I feel like it’s so hard to make deep connections nowadays especially coming from a small private school to a big university.

It was my sophomore year and I was taking mostly gen Ed classes. I found it hard to give a crap about school with COVID and the general stress that comes with finding your way in college. I decided to leave school and not waste money on something I wasn’t interested or focused on. I’ve worked many places and tried to see if I could start my life without college, which was fun and exiting for a while but turned repetitive and it felt like I was becoming stuck and sad that I wasn’t on the track to some sort of goal.

With all of that on my mind I decided try a few classes online, but they are mostly repeat classes or classes that feel way too simple to keep my interest in them. 

Does anyone have any tips for me?

I am 19 almost 20 and I am a Sophomore in College (Go Owls: FAU) I been at home since the pandemic (graduated HS in 2020 and then started college soon after virtual) and home life has been worsening significantly and I don't know what to do at all and I been at my wits both emotionally and mentally since I feel trapped, I feel useless, I feel sad bc I'm always being compared to by other ppl or my older sibling, I feel un heard and not being respected or listen to at all, and expectations set for me is unreasonable or if I somehow achieve it then parents back track/change their minds or make me feel like shit or vice versa.

I suspected I have a learning disability (ADHD &amp; Potentially Autism Scale) more than what limited information I know about my Speech and Language Disorder (which family never give a fuck about and usually be by myself in my IEP Meetings in HS) and my accommodations from HS bc of S&amp;L Disorder didn't transfer since my college requires a documentation from a Therapist &amp; Psychologist to which idk where to even begin since I'm all on my own and barley have any money. My close friends that I talk to about this also suspected that I have Depression, Anxiety and maybe even Bipolar (Ma is suspected to have it since she is crazy as hell and they want me to be tested bc genetics is a lovely thing, and don't want me to be off guard even tho haven't shown signs of it) but like what I need for accommodations for college I don't know where to even begin since this is overwhelming and I am afraid of not being able to tackle those issues or just continuing to deal with it ""on my own"" or be silent as usual 

I already applied and got accepted for single dorm housing on campus (have 2 or 3 roommates, originally 3 but one drop and is vacant but its a 4 bedroom housing where we share 2 bathrooms and have a private bedroom) with a 12 meal a week food plan for the upcoming Fall semester but I'm afraid, one because haven't told parents and don't drive (have permit since end of sophomore year in HS via driver's ed class after much hell in doing so, but need practice and anxious of driving both from parents yelling first then teach, Ma telling me I stole or mess up something in her car [isn't true bc I don't take from my own parents in terms of valuable stuff, things like gum or food yea but never money or what Ma accused me of taking or screwing up when I drive in her car] or me being Black and Femme lending NB) nor own a car and two, I'm anxious they just guilt me in staying and I be more stuck then ever. I'm tired of being so useless, I'm trying to stay steady for my friends and even tho my parents (more so my Ma since she calls me worthless and hopes stuff happen to me while Dad is passive and always working 2 jobs, he's a hard worker but hes strict and traditional, always goes with what Ma says even when she's wrong and then always making me have to apologize even when Ma as usual go past my boundaries or make me feel like I would be better off dead instead of adding onto the bill by living here) besides Dad I guess and maybe my older brother (don't have a good relationship but not as bad as Ma just neutral) prob would be happy if anything happens to me

I'm all on my own and idk how to do much in terms of being an adult. I know how to separate clothes and put them in the dryer then fold them as well as ironing but I never start a washer machine (at best Ik the soap and detergent stuff goes but dk like water temperature and which is the best setting for the type of clothes) my cooking skills is microwave or things that are simple since all my life my family made cleaning and cooking a ""female"" job and I reject that bc it was so stupid growing up seeing my Ma cook and what not then be pissed when I don't do so but when my brother does she says that he can stop and she wants me. Yea ik it bite me in the ass but I don't like being told I have to do something just bc I have a uterus, not to mention at least for this semester, we don't have a stove in the housing dorm and only a community housing kitchen in one of the floors. I know how to wash, put away and start a dish washer, swept the house and clean the bathroom but not sure if I need to learn more skills that I'm just either blankin out, never taught/get frighten by being told to go away and don't learn or vice versa

Idk what to do in terms of clothing or hair since one, a lot of clothes in my closet needs major updating since I detested the clothes I wear (a good 85% don't match what I want nor gender identity) and also shopping bc Ma always had to start something or when I get something she later takes it either bc she is upset or when I used to have report cards in K-12 whenever it didn't met her expectations it would get taken away same with birthday or Christmas gifts then takes it long enough she regifts it and me being a dummy I lowkey forgot about it so I get excited for the same stuff twice. Then bonus pts for Ma in comparing me with my older brother or other ppl who did better than me. I want to cut my hair bc I heard the symbolism that cutting your hair means change but I want something low maintenance that I be able to embrace my Haitian &amp; Black Ethnicity as well as learning how to manage my 4c Texture Hair since I am a newbie and dk the products nor braiding to do on myself (I tried on my childhood doll but I just keep on messing up and got sad so I just figured I'ma always have to pay or deal with my hair on my own). Once again I do not know how to go about this so I feel trapped and discouraged already

I don't know how to pack for dorms and not even sure if family would help me without it being a battle or worse make me cancel my housing and then depend on Ma to drive 45 min to and from college. I tried to compromise and said Tri Rail, Ride Sharing with a Friend or Apps, or Bus, parents said no and said that I have to depend on Ma since Dad always working and I don't want to do that both bc even tho I'm so behind in being an adult (*Sniffles*) 

I'm trying even tho I need guidance without being yelled at or hurt or overstimulated (being yelled at by different ppl is a good way or that party noise thingy you blow is also another way to cause me to react) and that I want space, I need air and I need help both for myself to be in a better place so I can live life beyond always being at home and always doing school (which is harder with no accommodations, being in a unsupportive household, indirectly being attacked on my gender and sexuality even tho haven't been out [Religious parents but usually Ma for this], classes isn't interesting and want to take classes that means something like major classes or classes that is more helpful than a General Ed Class can give hence the distractions but just have to force myself to work through it but its becoming harder to do so than b4) never hanging with friends or talkin on the phone (I was on a phone with a friend I haven't spoken to well besides text that is since the pandemic started then my Dad yell at me for being on the phone and then told me to do something Ma wanted me to do, it was to close the TV [Bruh] and then after that Ma told me all I do is eat, shit, be on my laptop/phone and sleep, then proceeds to attack and belittle me) or just have the freedom, the confidence and at ease to be a almost 20 year old in college.

I need help and in Mid August thats when move in day for my college begins (don't have an exact date yet) and I really dk where to begin so I can have a better year in college (I started off ok in Fall and Spring with a 3.52 GPA but then my summer classes kick my ass badly and I ended up withdrawing from a class [during add and drop week for 2nd half of summer thankfully] failing 3 classes (1 class but Canvas divides the 3 credit class into lecture and lab so that's technically 2) then Accounting 1 kick my ass (have to retake it in the Fall bc its required for a business major) bc of our Douchebag prof. The only class I manage to pass was Micro with a C which I'm upset on bc Ik I could have gotten an A but bc of me feeling more discouraged, feeling depressed, I just barley pull through and I feel so freaking guilty about it enough that I'm like bawling in my room for a week and a half privately as I hear in the background how worthless I am and a waste of space by Ma. 

Dad is always working and then whenever he does see me he just be upset at me and always makes me be around Ma 24/7 or told me that have some knowledge do something with my life or act like I have sense or be smart and whenever I do try like telling my parents about this Part Time Job in Mid April, about 10 min away from my house, my folks laugh in my face and then when I get to tell them the bonus of having 1,500 in money after a certain amount of time on the job, they told me to take my ass to CVS/Walgreens (Dad wants me to work in Medical as a first job and in a clean environment even tho I did and got rejected or never call back to which Dad pointed out the other ppl younger than me and made me feel like shit when he told me ""How come I can't be like them"" then told me to try again even tho we in like the worst job unemployment of our time like its so simple, I had so much tears whenever I eagerly open up a email from a job then get crushed when as usual don't get picked or saying their hold my file, told Dad and he says to try harder and stop making excuses and that I'ma feel it when I'm older don't want to do anything with my life) then being told I'm lucky I don't be hired and then fired in the same day.

Ma told me if I was a cart pusher like in the groccery store she would not even bat an eye to me and Dad has this expectations of me working in medical and clean which funny enough the job, Uniform Advantage fit everything that Dad wanted and a bonus it was in business something that I'm actually majoring in but parents never remember and still salty I'm not in Nursing in terms of a major. Hell, my Ma until recently used to lie to my other family members on how I went to other college and taking another major and don't even freakin acknowledge what I'm in and always as usual boast about how great and awesome my older brother is. I hate being told I'm not good enough, yes I freakin know it for years now, u don't have to repeat something I already know. And Dad for the longest time was pissed that I stand up to him and told him I don't want to be in nursing (For Haitian Kids we only got 6 career paths, Basketball or Football, Doctor, Nurse, Lawyer &amp; Engineer when a kid go against that parents flips their shit bc they want a kid to have a stable and known career with bonus pts of bragging rights ofc) and wanted to be in Health Administration/Human Resources and overall Business Aspect, he told me I'ma regret it and even now still feel like shit for standing up and making him upset but I guess its one of the many things I can't just help in making my parents upset about.

Anyways continuing on, when I told my Dad when we went out to shop for food a few weeks back the store and where its at, Dad told me no then when I ask him why he told me its not medical, I reply back its a medical business that sells Scrubs for medical professionals like nurses and assistants, then he told me to apply to CVS and Walgreens which I told him why I can't as explain earlier, then he told me to apply to T-Mobile, I asked Dad in confusion how the heck T-Mobile is medical unless I missed a huge memo that T-Mobile sells Medical Devices instead of phones idk how its medical. I love my Dad but damn it he be contradicting himself and then he tells me I'm being disrespectful whenever I talk back or ask for clarification (hence I be silent and stay confused a lot leading me to get yelled at a lot since idk what I was being asked and when I ask for clarification I get told to have some sense and to figure it out) but anyways he told me that T-Mobile was clean and I legit had to fight off the urge to freakin face palm at this tho like omg Jesus Christ take the wheel.

I just need help, in terms of getting my life together and myself once I'm on campus if by some freakin miracle Parents don't start shit or make me feel like shit and guilt me into canceling the housing contract. I need a part time job to start saving for Study Abroad which I want to do in Spring 2023 and Fall of 2023 of Junior year to Australia, I need money and I don't want to depend on family more than I already have to (ex: that stupid FAFSA) and not to mention it already hurts like mf hell to take out loans for Housing which I still owe even with with loans (sub and unsubsidized loans from FAFSA) and maximum Pell Grant, I need to pay a lil over 750 out of pocket to pay clear off my balance for the fall term and its going to be the same for Spring housing as well. 

The area near my college is expensive as hell and I doubt my folks will cosign me an apartment and even if they did where the hell is a college student going to come up with 1700 per month without sacrificing full time college or being in a bad position to pay it off even with roommates its still expensive not to mention I'm not trying to scare off ppl or be afraid or deal with much ppl since I already come from a rough background I do not want to take out loans and want not just to be in the same environment again. I just feel like I'm trapped since I legit choose being in debt which I avoided for the longest then staying at home and being debt free but feel like shit.

I'm scared that my folks is going to be right and I continue to be useless, I'm trying and I feel like I'm drowning in not being able to function correctly for not being like other ppl my age is doing, I'm just tired of being this way, I didn't ask for this, to be this complicated, to be always being in pain, too hopeful, too optimistic even when hurt, too always being slow and useless, I just don't know how to feel at all anymore

I think this is a good stopping point, there is plenty I could say about my family, but I think y'all can have an idea, I just need some help with dealing with Extreme Helicopter and Toxic (more so Ma but Dad has his moments) parents with impossible expectations and making me feel like no matter how much I try I can never do it, I just end up wasting everyone's time just like what Ma always tells me. I need help with this college stuff as well, I just need help with a lot and stop feeling like I'm drowning.

Even with Ma harsh words and Dad's critical and passive, I don't hate them, I should when it comes to my Mother at least, I still have a few decent memories on whenever Ma is not being a bitch or breakin me further on how she used to be proud on when I do something like she still keep that hand print I did in 1st grade as a Mother's day gift its on the counter of her bathroom, but even with the good memories I still have on her, it doesn't replace her words or actions in the present or rather previous actions and it hurts like hell so much. I be lying if I say I'm not effected by Mother anymore, that I don't constantly wish for her to change or it be back to where it used to, that I secretly envy the ppl that had understanding and great parents.

I don't feel supported, I feel like I'm an inconvenience, I feel like I'm here bc I have to be, I feel like I'm not living a life and its just a endless cycle that I can't escape from, I feel guilty for feeling like this since ppl have it way worse than I do, I feel like my feelings don't matter and that it's ok I'm being treated like this since for the longest time I thought (and still is even when friends told me it isn't) was normal, I been told my feelings don't matter (Mother) or idk what stress is since idk how to work and I'm a piece of shit (Mother again) so idk where to even go about for this at all, need advice please and thank you",college,How Does One Improve Their Life After Leaving Toxic Helicopter Parents Household (Well Trying Too) For College (Sophomore),https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/obx13y/how_does_one_improve_their_life_after_leaving/,1625197063.0

I have incredibly severe anxiety (Generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder). I have had these illnesses since 2013. It’s so bad that it is considered a disability. I could never complete a full year (in person) of high school because of it. 

When I went to college, it got a lot better. I attended all my classes and got great grades. However, once the pandemic hit and since I’ve been stuck inside with very little interaction, my anxiety has been through the roof since about the beginning of 2021.

I stopped going to one of my classes because it was a major point of anxiety for me. At the start of the semester (before I stopped going), I tried to talk to the professor (who is also my advisor) about having an extremely hard time getting back into things, but he would only focus on the project that we were working on. To be blunt I was on the verge of having a complete breakdown in his office and he would only talk about the specifics of the project. Well, this built up a shit ton of anxiety. In my mind, if this project is all the guy was willing to talk about, it MUST be important.

So I did what I always end up doing, I stopped attending. I couldn’t look this man in the eyes. I couldn’t look anywhere near his direction. No fucking way was I sitting in a class with him and 5 other people. 

I emailed him at the end of the year, begging for an incomplete and explaining the situation. He is only giving me the opportunity to make up 2 assignments (out of the 5 that I missed) and at the highest, I could get a C.

Now, some people say I should take it, but some (myself included) believe that this is a bit unfair. Again, this is a documented disability that I have had for years now and no teacher or Professor has been this much of an ass about it. I’m wondering if I should say something to him about it? He’s had me in classes before, and he knows that I usually get A’s. I’m not even sure what I would say, but again, I sort of feel like it’s unfair that I can only get a C since this was directly caused by a documented disability. Am I overreacting? What should I do?",college,"Professor won’t give me a fair chance, even after disclosing my disability",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/o95o02/professor_wont_give_me_a_fair_chance_even_after/,1624846038.0

hello ! I didn't know who else to talk to so I figured why not try making a reddit post and get advice from people on the internet ;-; I'm thinking about dropping out or at least taking another gap year. I'm currently in the middle of my summer holidays, but this has been something I've been thinking about for quite sometime. I just don't know how to tell my parents. Like a lot of people over the last year, my mental health has gone down quite significantly. I had recently finished my second year of college and the last semester was especially hard, because the workload was quite a lot and many of them were challenging. Towards the end of that semester, I found myself getting easily stressed to the point where it affected my physical health (also because of this one teacher I had for one of my classes, she made me so stressed and I hated it). That made me realise that I've been pushing myself too much and even if I wanted to take care of myself first, I couldn't afford to.

For context, I'm Filipino and although my parents are quite conservative and old school, I was still able to choose the course I wanted to do. I also grew up abroad, which is why I had such a hard time adjusting to the lifestyle and the education system here in the Philippines. I moved back here for college back in 2019 with my mum and sister, while my dad is still overseas working. I really wanna open up to my parents about how I've been feeling lately but unfortunately, I'm not emotionally open with them. We never talk about emotions or anything like that :/// There was a time earlier this year I tried telling my dad how I was feeling, but I don't think he fully understood :// also, I'm already really behind other people my age. Which is one of the reasons my dad won't let me take a gap year, is because he doesn't want me to fall behind even further. If I do take a gap year, I need to find something to do during that time. I don't have a hobby or anything and even if I did, it would be very short lived. Based on past experiences, I get bored really easily and often leave things unfinished T\^T  I don't even have anything I'm passionate about. I also can't work or get a job because my parents won't allow me (yes I'm an adult but they still won't let me get a job unless I've graduated) and also because of other personal reasons. I want to take a gap year because I really want to work on myself and focus on taking care of myself for the time being. But I don't think I'll be able to afford to do this and I think my parents will be disappointed in me if I'm not in school. I also feel really guilty for even wanting to do this in the first place, because I know many people are also struggling but they're still trying their best to continue. 

I'm posting this here because I really don't know who else to talk to. I've talked to my friends and gotten advice from them but I wanted to see if there's anyone on here that can also give me some advice about what I should do and how should I approach my parents about this topic. I just feel really lost right now. I don't know what to do.

I’m making this post because I’ve seen quite a few humanities/social sciences majors unsure of how to gain relevant experience in their fields. Since I’m a public policy major my tips are more geared towards politicos science, public policy, sociology, international relations, etc students but hopefully other people can find these tips useful too.

For the stressed out underclassmen: I’m going to be a senior in the fall and I didn’t have an internship the summer before junior year and I’m doing well now. However, I tried as hard as I could during my junior year to have multiple internships which is why I’m set up well now.  Not gonna lie, it’s a grind, but getting the experience is important (and maybe even more important than academics, depending on your long term goals).

I’ll be graduating with about a dozen internships (I’m on a quarter system so this helps) and have helped multiple leadership positions and maintained a pretty solid GPA along the way. Also, I go to a random state school so for folks who are worried about how their non-Ivy or not very prestigious school affects their chances please breathe, you are just as smart and capable! I often struggle with imposter syndrome because many people in my previous internship cohorts were Ivy League students but your institution does not define your skills or intelligence.

You can find companies and roles by going on LinkedIn and typing in key words (as a polisci major you might want to focus on words like advocacy, government affairs and relations, public affairs, policy, etc. and specific issues that you care about, like voting rights). You should also look use LinkedIn to find your classmates and alumni with a similar/same major to you to see where they’ve interned or worked at. If one of their previous roles or companies interests you, you can then reach out to them and ask about their experiences and they may even be able to serve as a referral.

Handshake is also helpful for finding positions just for students! I personally don’t like the layout as much as LinkedIn but it does a much better job of filtering out positions I’m totally unqualified for than LinkedIn. 

Look through your department websites and see if they have any advice - some post internship opportunities and/or have a list of places students have interned at in the past. Contact and/or meet with your advisor to get their advice too - my advisor is fantastic and even emails me occasionally about internship opportunities. Also, use them and your career center for resume and cover help. I don’t care how good though think your resume and cover letter are, it can always be improved. 

Get involved with any relevant campus organizations - there are many that are directly or indirectly related to politics and the law. Many campuses also have mock trial, model UN, newspapers and magazines, etc which can help boost your resume - these are not regular clubs though and will require a decent amount of time so take them seriously if you choose to join.

Make a list of orgs you want to volunteer or intern at, either in person or virtually and keep track of their internship or career pages and any deadlines associated with it. Larger companies/organizations or ones with really robust, popular internship programs tend to have a page where they explain when their internship applications open and in which departments they’re seeking interns. 

On-campus jobs might be really helpful too - working in student government, your schools government relations office, a sustainability office (if you’re interested in the environment), a research position, etc. Some offices/departments may offer internships instead of jobs too.

For example, a classmate of mine was interested in energy policy and worked at our schools sustainability office which was pretty cool and allowed them to gain relevant experience. 

Your school may also offer a DC internship program (like the UC in DC one) and/or offer scholarships to help you while you’re in DC. 

If you’re into electoral politics there are usually plenty of campaigns running year round that are pretty easy to hop onto.

If you want to work in government, consider checking out your city, county, and state government in addition to federal roles. These tend to not be as competitive and are still valuable experiences.

Working on personal projects in R, STATA, excel, etc are also a good way to develop or sharpen quantitative skills. Make sure to also take your classes reasonably seriously - you can use a paper as a writing sample and this has benefitted me in quite a few internship apps.",college,Gaining experience as a humanities/social sciences student,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/o8h1yi/gaining_experience_as_a_humanitiessocial_sciences/,1624752657.0
219,Muvinco,1624288143,/r/college/comments/o4x9vy/advice_from_a_recent_college_grad/,"I graduated from a 4 year college in May - I didn't have the best experience but I think I made the most of it. I learned a lot about myself and a lot of underclassmen have told my tips helped them so here are my tips/advice (for background, I was an Econ major): 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Take Your Time** \- You don't have to do every single major requirement in your first 2 years. I paced out my major pretty slowly and it worked wonders for me. My senior year I had to take 5 classes to finish my major (3 in the fall, 2 in the spring) but they were all easy electives. Spacing out requirements gave me the bandwidth to take easier classes so I could focus on my core courses. I knew lots of people that did too much too early and burned out by sophomore. They ended up switching majors or just unhappy.  

&amp;#x200B;

* **Free Time is King** \- Every school/major is different but try to make a schedule that has more classes that only meet 1-2 times a week. Sometimes I would take classes that I knew would suck but they only met once a week so it was worth it for me. Having more free time in your schedule gives you **time to study, go to the gym, meet with friends, get a job, office hours, etc.** I didn't have classes on Fridays on my last 5 semesters of college and it was one of the best things for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Everyone's Path is Different** \- Try not to compare yourself to others. It's hard not to, but try your hardest. Some of your peers/friends may get great internships or research opportunities while you're still trying to figure out what you want to do. That's okay. **Just focus on doing what's best for you.** When I was a sophomore I applied to countless internships and didn't get any but my peers were all going to big companies like Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan. I used to feel like a failure for so long but I ended up stressing myself for no reason because 2 years later I ended up in the same companies as them. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **""There's More to Life than School""** \- This is what I would tell myself when I would get burned out. I like to think I'm a high achiever but everyone has their limits. If you ever get to the point where your mental health is suffering, just remind yourself there's more to life than school. **Take a break, go out.** It's okay to get a B or a C from time to time. **As long as you know you tried your hardest, that's all that matters.**",college,Advice From a Recent College Grad,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/o4x9vy/advice_from_a_recent_college_grad/,1624306143.0
220,Taakane,1624257050,/r/college/comments/o4ow0d/im_terrified_of_what_my_college_experience_will/,"Sorry to break whatever mood you might be in but I’m literally shuddering at the thought of my CS pathway. 

For context: I am an incoming freshman to a CC and I am planning on transferring to UCI as a CS major. I know this major is involved with A LOT of math and I’m not the best at math.

My first experience with college will be tomorrow/today and it’s a trig class. This class will not contribute to my major but completing the course will get me a $1000 scholarship so I decided to do it. But from what I’ve heard about other people’s experiences taking math courses in general along with my lack of confidence in my math skills makes this course seem very daunting. It’s an 8 week course that’s 6 units (4 units for the course itself and a 2 unit “support” class). It’s literally going to start tomorrow/today and I’ve gotten no message from my school or my professor so what a great start… 

But my main concern is the shear amount of math courses I’ll have to take with my math skills being not the best and the rigor of college compared to high school.

I was never the studious student at my high school; mostly got A’s and B’s throughout my high school career and took “honors” and “AP” courses in every math course I had. You may think this makes me more capable compared to others when it comes to math but I struggled in my honors algebra 3 and honors pre-calc and I got a B in both courses. Probably would’ve gotten a C if I didn’t cheat (which I’m honestly not proud of when I look back on it, though the cheating was “minor”). I took AP Calc AB last school year in my senior year and got an A during both semesters but my teacher gave us an opportunity to retake our tests once and since it was online, the retake questions were exactly the same, making it very easy to get an A on the tests. And when I took the final, I totally bombed both first and second semester but still got an A because of the retakes. (FYI, only took 4 AP’s during my HS career and so far, have failed every one)

Now what does this have to do with my post? Well, College is a very different rodeo compared to high school and I had to rely on some sort of cheating to get by. And I’ve seen any post about people getting caught cheating and facing serious consequences. I’m not the study type; I haven’t studied for as long as I remember and got A’s up until 10th grade without cheating (which I want to stress again was minor but still bad nevertheless). I’m very scared that I have to take many math courses from Calc 1-3, differential equations, linear algebra, and physics and I’m going to try and avoid cheating since cheat only gives me a ~5-10% boost and I don’t think the potential consequences are worth it. 

With all of those hard math classes, I don’t think I will have time to live due to all the “studying” I have to do and that concerns me a lot. Like I said earlier, I’m not the best study type and when I try to study, my mind wanders off and I loose focus. I tried changing my environment and the same thing follows. I’m thinking of studying in 20 minutes bursts but I know for a fact that I’m not disciplined enough to even keep a morning routine so how could I do that? 

In addition to those math classes, I have to take other GE’s like English, arts, and programming. I, for one, suck at English and creative writing more than math. I shiver at the “thesis’s and 20 page reports/essays” I’ll have to do in English and courses requiring labs. I’ve kept the same writing tactic I’ve used in 8-9th grade and I don’t think college will grade like they did in high school. And as if those math classes weren’t enough, I will also have to learn programming which is an entirely new concept to me and studying for math will give me no time to study other subject like programming. And the rigor of these courses will definitely get to someone like me who values their free time a lot. 

I also want to be  able to do well in college while having free time to do other things like joining clubs or pursuing my passions (learning a new language and starting a YouTube channel). But I fear that the math courses and English papers will take all the free time I will ever have and I probably won’t even have any time to study! I feel like college will be the death of me and I’m not even sure what I’m doing anymore. 

TL;DR: I’m hyperventilating rn for the next four years of my life because I have to take many math courses and I suck at math and other courses I have to take alongside it will take up any free time I’ll have so I won’t be able to do anything  I like or join any clubs and I don’t know what to do anymore.",college,I’m terrified of what my college experience will be like (CS major) (Confused and STRESSED),https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/o4ow0d/im_terrified_of_what_my_college_experience_will/,1624275050.0

I've been struggling in computer science for a long time now, for different reasons. I flunked a lot of classes when I first started. I'm not going to give a long sob story, but eventually I decided to pull myself together. After 8 years in community college, it was finally time to apply for the computer science program at the university I've always dreamed of. The first time I met with the advisor, she took one look at my transcript and literally said it would be a waste of time to apply. I tried telling her I spoke with a counselor about why I failed so many classes, but she wouldn't hear it. She said the material must've been too hard for me. (Joke's on her - I made it into the program... But unfortunately she's the only computer science advisor and she remembers me. I get the displeasure of having to speak with her every semester.)

Now I'm working on my bachelor's, and it looks like it's going to be another long 3 years. I just feel very defeated. I've been working full-time and paying for tuition out of pocket through this. Now my struggle is trying to find the time for class.

I was consistently working 12 hour days as the AGM of a hotel. I quickly fell behind in the class I'm taking. This is not the first time I've fallen behind and had to skate by with a C in a class. I already tried speaking with my professor, and he basically told me to reach out to the TA or the Dean. (Strange) I thanked him and said I would reach out to the TA, and he responded ""Today is Sunday. Most people don't read emails on weekends. Please wait until Monday.""

Anyway I'm wondering if the problem is just me... Maybe I'm just completely failing at college. I already put in my 2 week notice at my job since it's too demanding. I want to work part time somewhere and refocus on school. I just feel like it's going to be a waste. I don't feel like I can compete with other people in the field. It's been 8 years and you'd think I would have learned more than Java and C++... but that's it. I also don't feel supported by the staff at my university and at this point I'm starting to build resentment toward the place.

Any advice on what I should do? Should I transfer to another college and maybe get a chance to start over? Should I keep going and just try to get more experience (and hopefully confidence) in the field? Anyone else with similar experiences?

TL;DR I took 8 years to get my associates. Now I'm getting my bachelors and I'm falling behind again because I can't balance work and school. My academic advisor and professors basically snub their noses at me. Has anyone had a similar experience?

I started college in 2006 at a large public university.  My first two years went well enough, I had a 3.5 GPA.    
Unfortunately in my junior year, life hit hard.  Death of a parent, bad relationship with an unplanned pregnancy and difficult abortion, I also started struggling with mental health more at this time.  I stopped attending classes, a few months into the semester and failed all of them.  I tried to rally for the second semester and repeated the same experience, ultimately leading to my academic dismissal.

Immediately went into the work force, and while I have been very lucky with jobs overall - I would like to finish my degree and not have that as a limiting factor.  

Should I apply and try to attend my previous college, or look into community or remote schooling to potentially transfer?  My previous Dean's office hasn't been great with response or answers. Is there a way to salvage any of my time in college?

Ive had a hard time finding what I'm passionate about in my major, and I have only 2 semesters left. I decided to participate in undergraduate research as I hoped that getting some hands on experience in the field would help me figure out my interests. In January, I reached out to a professor whose research interests seem fascinating, asking if she had any availability in her lab. She had a PhD student who needed an assistant, so I decided to join as an assistant. I didn't find the lab work that interesting from the start, but I didn't know any better (first time working in a lab), and I thought it would get more interesting as time went on and I became better trained--there was a LOT to learn. I was already struggling to get through all of my chemistry core classes as well at the same time-I still do decent in school, have around a 3.5 gpa . I honestly really tried, I took notes, always double checked everything, showed up on time, etc.. In April, on the last day of lab work, I was asked by the PhD student if I wanted to continue with lab work in the summer, I said yes, he said ok (I didn't even know they had summer work. Fast forward one week, I emailed the grad student,  asking about the lab schedule a couple of days before I was supposed to start as I thought it was wierd that I hadn't gotten the schedule yet.  Never heard anything back, I was ghosted. Fast forward to Monday (5 days ago), the professor emailed me asking if I had time to meet on Tuesday. Showed up to her office, she told me this : ""I talked with with graduate student, he said you are lazy, unmotivated, and not passionate, would you still like to consider working in the lab with us in the summer ?"" To which I said no, I think it's better if I resign,  and I walked out.  

It kind of hurt to hear, not going to lie, but ive used this as an opportunity to grow as a person. I've taken the past 5 or so days to reflect and be brutally honest with myself about my passions and my future ambitions. Ive realized that I'd be much happier if I finished out my undergrad and went to graduate school in a different field. A field which I am truly passionate about and love, and I've been interested in it since I was like 5, but my parents said they were not gonna pay my undergrad tuition if I went into this field

I’m 27 years old. I started college when I was 18 at a community college. Stayed 3 years there. Didn’t do great. Transferred to a 4 year. Stayed 3 years there. Did even worse. I did poorly because I had no idea what I wanted to do but was terrified (and advised not to) to withdraw or take a break. So I changed my major over and over. I do poorly in classes I don’t care about, plus I was struggling with mental health. I ended up finally leaving the 4 year in 2018 after it was obvious I was either going to fail out or leave on my own.

I moved with my partner and started a full time job. I’ve been out of school now for almost 4 years. I’m still working a full time job (retail) and have finally decided to go back to school. I finally know what I want to do in life. I finished my associates degree in 2020 in hopes it’d boost my admission chances at 4 years, and now it’s time to finish my bachelors. I applied to 4 schools and was rejected by all but 1. I was accepted as a biological sciences major. I was over the moon that I was accepted. Until I looked at the course schedule for the Fall and realized not a single one will fit with my work schedule. Since it’s mainly hard science courses, none of them are offered online and all follow a schedule of “Monday Wednesday Friday” plus labs that are on Tuesday’s and Thursday’s. That is just not possible with a full time job. 

I’m devastated because I made it this far, and now because of a job that pays the bills but I hate, I won’t be able to go back. I thought of a few options and none will work:

Option A: Attend school part time.
Won’t work because it’s not a matter of too many classes, it’s a matter of none of them fit my work schedule
Option B: Quit my job and find a part time job.
Won’t work because I have a large amount of expenses (like rent) that a part time job can’t afford
Option C: Keep a full time job, but find a better job that is more flexible
I’ve tried. In the last few months I’ve sent out around 25 applications for jobs I’d either enjoy more or would have a better work/life balance and haven’t received a call from a single one.

So I’m out of options. I’m panicking because at this point i feel like the world is telling me I missed my chance at getting my bachelors, and I will be stuck at a job in a field I don’t want to work in for the rest of my life.

Hello everyone, I'm in need of some advice. 

This might be a long one, I'm writing as I think. I'll put a TLDR at the bottom. 

I have to choose a major by the end of my fall semester (december). I've been having so much trouble deciding and commiting to a major. I keep bouncing off between STEM and non STEM majors. 

In one hand, I do really good in the humanities like anthropology or english, but i do have a hard time  in math classes, depending on the teacher. On the other hand, I always go towards the STEM majors. I went to a STEM based Charter school and did well in my engineering class and apparently my mentor in robotics (same as engineering teacher) thought i was really good in engineering. In my first year of CC, I did so poorly in my math class, I kept failing no matter how much i studied or tutored. It crushed my confidence again. On the the bright side, 2 years later, I recently took a Math for STEM class and passed with a B! and I barely struggled this time! So, I'm more confident in math now.  ( however, I do suffer from depression and anxiety and it's been making things much harder for me. I have low motivation, anything hard is scaring me away, which I know i need to work on, and I don't do well without structure.)

However, I'm still afraid of the math and phyics classes that are coming my way, if I choose to stay as a STEM major. And I have to decide pretty soon. I do have support if i choose to continue on the STEM path (support as in a mentor, not being forced). I'm just afraid of commiting I guess. 

I have a bad habit to equate easy being something i like.  In my cultural anthropology class, it was easy for me, but was also interesting to an extent. I was at first an anthro major for quite a while, but I realised that I wasn't very passionate about it as I tried making it out to be. After I built my computer, I realized I'm really passionate about technology. Once realizing this, I wanted to do something with tech,....but I don't know where to go with it. In addition, I learned I like selling things like tech and video games and have done fairly well. However, again, I don't know what to do with it. 

After X'ing out potential majors, I've been stuck choosing between engineering or business or something completely else as my main majors. I already plan on minoring/double majoring in something. 

What I need help understanding is... how do I get over my fears? How did you decide on what to major in? How much does passion/excite equate in choosing a major? I have to admit, when I like something, I obsess for many months and then burn out. I want to be mindful of this fact. For those who had a hard time choosing a major, how did you find it or are you still looking? For the Non STEM what lead you to that major? To those in STEM, what made you choose that? I know there's no perfect major, but I just want to be ok. Thank you for reading this long ass post.

I have to apply for college next year. I want to study business and management or economics and finance. I have already chosen a couple of places where I want to apply. But I’m a bit scared of a new life that waits for me there. So can you share some of your experiences, please?

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is that I’ve rarely left my hometown and never tried to live in other states or even cities. So I’m a bit scared to move far away from where I have grown up, and leave the place where I know, everybody. Besides, I remember how stressful it was to go to high school with almost new people, especially new teachers.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe the reason is that I didn’t get well with some of my teachers. Because of some teachers, I don’t feel confident in writing essays. I have no idea that is a problem with my writing skills or they simply hate me. For some classes, I feel like I am the worst student ever. I’ve tried to discuss it with my principal and explain that I need to apply for a college. But he is good friends with my teachers, so he didn’t take my side. He told me that I need to study hard, and that’s it. Well, I wanna learn and want to improve my writing skills. 

&amp;#x200B;

Besides, I’ve heard that it doesn’t matter which major I will choose. I still need to write essays and even theses in my final year. This freaks me out because I have no idea either if I really need to improve something. If yes, then what exactly? I found this video tutorial online — [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ir9z\_O4P3A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ir9z_O4P3A). It explains some basic principles on how to write theses and dissertations. But I don’t think that it will be enough for me. Can you recommend me something else too? Maybe you know a good tutor that will be able to give me a couple of lessons online?

I took on an extra class as well as a codepath course thinking I'd be able to manage the workload. It turns out I was not able to and had to drop one of my classes. This caused my graduation to be pushed back to next year since the class is only offered next Fall. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had also applied earlier this year to a few graduate programs with not a lot of confidence that I'd get accepted anywhere. It was just a hail mary attempt at trying to continue my education after I graduated. Well I dropped that class and that ended up pushing my graduation back to next year, then suddenly I started getting replies back from these graduate programs. I've been accepted at all but once of the schools I had applied to. This is where I started to go into a downward spiral and beating myself up over having not tried hard enough in the class I had to drop. 

&amp;#x200B;

As it is right now, this is by far the worst quarter I've had to date... like I'm doing so so bad. I dont blame anyone else but me, I take full responsibility for my situation. I've been in school so long now that I kind of lost sight of what I was even doing here. I've never been a bad student so it feels really shitty that I'm going through the withdrawal process at the moment with my university. I do plan on going back in the Fall and finishing up my last few classes and graduating but I cant help but feel like such a failure. I wont be graduating this year anymore...

I’m having a really hard time trying to figure out what I need to do. Here’s the story, I’m supposed to be a senior in college in the fall graduating on May 2022. However, I struggled to get into nursing school. I know this now, but it was very dumb of me to stick with the same college and should have looked into other nursing schools around me. But I kept on applying to the same nursing program and I got denied three times which makes me behind 3 semesters; the nursing program I applied to is 2.5 years. Since I only had one more chance before I couldn’t apply to the same program anymore. I took the TEAS serious since it was the only thing that was preventing me from getting in. I finally got accepted and I start in August. I should be happy and looking forward to it. Here’s the problem I keep on thinking about how behind I am and how I should already be in the program. I don’t graduate with my nursing degree until December 2023 which I’m very embarrassed about. Also, I thought I could graduate with an exercise science degree in May 2022, so I don’t have to feel like I wasted my four years. Unfortunately, my advisor told me if I wanted to graduate in May I need to drop nursing school and reapply to the program and the university again. Basically, I won’t have a guaranteed spot in the program even though I already got accepted. And if I want the nursing degree I have to wait and graduate with both degrees in Dec. 2023. I wanted to mention that whenever I started college, I thought I wanted to be a nurse but now I’m not sure. I’m afraid I won’t be able to handle it. I have no idea what I’m going to do with EXS degree. I’m constantly thinking about the time frame; I don’t understand why I’m so obsessed about it. I feel like I should move on and accept what’s going on. I need advice on if I should graduate in May 2022 with the exs degree so I don’t feel like I’m behind or just wait until Dec 2023 and get both degrees at the same time.

I tried to keep up with the online work but I found it very difficult. I was pursuing a degree in English. I started to struggle in college towards the end of my sophomore year. I found it very difficult to pay attention in class and keep up with the course work, I lost a lot of points through constantly missing deadlines which negatively affected my grades. That’s also around the time I started falling into depression and my anxiety was getting really bad. By my senior year things got worse, I was missing credits, my gpa had lowered and I was in a bad relationship/had to live with my ex and it was hard to focus on school.

235,NotATaquito,1620960606,/r/college/comments/nbym2w/how_do_i_stay_motivated/,"Since school transferred from in person to online, i feel like I have been slowly losing my motivation to be in active in my classes. I graduated high school in 2019 and I never cared about school, I was always lazy and lethargic. When I graduated I realized how difficult it would be in the real world if I maintained this sort of work ethic with my education, so when I enrolled in a community college I made a promise to myself to not become the person I was in high school. 

My first semester was ok, I was able to attend in person classes for 3 months before covid forced my college to switch to online learning. I was able to do well that semester, for the first time I got 3 A’s, 1 B and 1 C in my record.

The second semester my level of motivation just dropped, my teachers weren’t that good in teaching me trigonometry and biology , that I often resulted in me teaching myself with the internet because their lessons were pretty bad. I barely passed that semester. The only classes I had that were engaging were my Texas Government and the biology lab, and those I did ok in.

This semester I only took 3 classes, whereas last semester I took 6, thinking since I was having a hard time handling so many courses, taking 3 courses instead would ease the load on me. I took PreCalculus, Chemistry 1 and the Lab. A Schedule error resulted in me taking the chemistry lab in the regular term start in January, and the chemistry lecture course would begin in February.

I dropped the chemistry lab course around March because I couldn’t handle the speed at which the lab was going at. By late February, my lab was covering content from chapter 6 and my lectures was covering content from chapter 2.

I ended up finishing the semester but I failed both of my courses. My chemistry class was by far the worst class i have ever had. From the beginning of the course, she told us that the course was going to be covered without class meetings, and that we were going to teach ourselves. She provided us with a PowerPoint of each chapter and a small selection of YouTube channels that we could watch. She also told us to use the OpenStax textbook if we needed help but it was pretty much useless imo. She didn’t give us homework, only a quiz covering the entire chapter we were assigned that week. She said we should only contact her if it was an emergency.

There isn’t much to say about my precal course, we had a decent professor, class meetings, we used My Lab and Mastering for assignments and it’s online textbook. A lot more interactive, but an insane amount of homework.

I stayed on course for about 3 months before I stopped caring about it. I tried to get back on course but it was difficult to retain the knowledge I forgot. I asked my chemistry lecture professor when I was starting to feel unmotivated what was happening but she never responded to my email. There were a couple times where I was able to get back in the rhythm, but every time I failed an exam I started caring less and less. At the end, i speed ran my final exams, finished in less than 8 minutes each, and got a 66 and 45 as my exam grades, with my final grade for the class both being in the high 60’s.

Over the past year or so, I’ve been trying to join the military, but due to an IEP that hasn’t happened. So after a year of trying and dialing with every branch. I decided to apply to college just to have as a backup plan. I applied to Norwich University in Vermont. Just some past information, I never was the smartest in school. I never took AP or honor classes, or even the SAT or ACT. This is because all throughout high school I was just set on the plan on joining the military, so I never tried in school. Now a year later after being denied by every branch, it seems like college was my only option. To my luck, I ended up getting accepted to the class of 2025 for Norwich University and I’ll be doing the Corp of cadets and NJROTC! 
    
    This is the biggest accomplishment for me so far because I tried my hardest to write a super good essay that would help my chances of being put into college and it seems like it worked out fine. Now here’s the bad part, my family wants no say in helping me with college. They think I’m too stupid to attend college, they think it’s a waste of time and money for me right now, they think that Norwich is just using me for money because they accepted me when I didn’t do too well in school. They even told me they will never sign a loan for me and I have to fund college myself. 

     I know about all the people who will say “oh just do community college and then attend Norwich” it’s not that simple because to do the Corp of cadets lifestyle at Norwich, you have to start as a freshman. Right now this is all I really want in life as I’ve given up trying for the military after a year of getting denied by every branch. My family doesn’t seem to care what I want though because they are forcing me to still do military and kinda ripping college out of my hands. I personally think fate has lead me here to this route in my life, because if the military was really supposed to be my plan then why hasn’t it worked out yet. 

      I think everything happened for a reason and I’m meant to attend college and make a better life for myself and become more successful then what my parents want me to be. The only help I need is with getting a loan, I think one year right now at Norwich for me is 40k. I just need help or advice on the best way to get a loan for just one year, because after that one year I WILL apply for a marine ROTC scholarship and I WILL get it because this is all I want right now in my life. My family did help me fill out my federal aid, but my parents make too much so I don’t qualify for any of it. 

      So now I’m on my own for trying to find Norwich just for this first year until I can apply and get a scholarship. I don’t need people trying to bash me or tell me I’m wrong. I’m here seeking advice and help, since my family doesn’t care about what I want and I don’t really have anyone to help me out right now since it’s really hard doing this by myself at 19.

I’m still up tonight re-watching another lecture while I type this the night before my last 3 finals of college. I feel completely stupid and I’m about certain I’m about to fail my last 3 exams tomorrow. I don’t think I got to this spot suddenly and randomly. I’ve screwed myself progressively over the pandemic and I don’t know how to get out of the hole that’s been dug. 

I was a 4.0 student in highschool. Valedictorian. I got a 4.0 my freshman year, a 3.5 my sophomore year, and a 3.2 my junior year. The pandemic hit partway through my junior year. I made it out fine. I could have easily gotten a 4.0 again had I applied myself harder. But I didn’t. Senior year rolls around and I’m locked in an apartment alone.

I spent a few months feeling sorry for myself, leaning on my excuses, and I lazily worked on school but I had lost all motivation.

Then the other 5 classes hit. B term. 3 of the 5 are some of the hardest you’ll take at university. I didn’t know this as my advisor basically didn’t exist[see previous note].

Well here I am. I take those 3 hard class finals starting in a few hours and I’m about to see what I can do. I’m not at all confident and if the practice questions show anything, I’m going to fail. I’m out of time. I’m out of energy. I have 6.5 hours. 

My dad is the worst at being reasonable. He has no leniency and me not getting a 4.0 was the end of the world before. I can’t imagine how life is going to turn out for me in a few short days here.

Just a bit about me, Im a 2nd year college student currently attending a Cal State University. I have been on the Dean's List twice already and have a GPA of 3.45 ! It may not seem much to some people but I am insanely proud of where I am now. I could write a book about my experiences if I could, lol. I've had alot of my trust be put into jeopardy and people lie yo me constantly.

I've suffered from all of this since I was born and I had to experience my high school and middle school to the best of my ability. I had my spinal surgery during middle school during 8th grade. I had to be put into home schooling to recover and when I tried to go back to school, i couldn't keep up with the workload because of the severe pains I was having. It tore apart my education and as an honors roll student I was so devastated. At the same time, one of my teachers would bully me. Telling me to go home and that I was too weak. She excluded me from potentionally life-saving educational opportunities that could have really helped me. She picked her favorite students and guided them towards their college goals while I was left wondering if she really liked me. I became severly depressed because of this.

I lost all my friends because I stopped showing up to school and they simply just stopped talking to me. They also made fun of my health conditions so yeah fuck them. I had to go to therapy because I was contemplating suicide and was so afraid to return back to school and face these teachers who said awful things to me. I was very shy and timid and was always taught never to raise my voice at my teachers so of course I stayed quiet about it. Until I broke down crying in front of my parents and told them that the teachers weren't giving me an opportunity to catch up on homework and give me the time of day to learn. I was in therapy for about 6 years. 

Then high school came, I was in and out of in-person schooling because of the pains and because I had my 2nd spinal surgery. No one called me up asking if I was okay. I spent my days on twitter, youtube, and tumblr learning how to draw, paint, write, and pretty much everything I could ever do. My home schooling teachers were absolute shit, they weren't even my teachers they just dropped off my school work and left lol. I had to teach myself Algebra 2 using just the book. I felt fucking stupid, but despite everything I still got honors roll. I complained about the discrimmination of students with health disqabilities to my high school and they ignored me. I would pass out in the hallways and the next day Id show up half dead because I dragged my ass to English class. The teachers would call me lazy and tell me I wasn't doing enough.

I wondered if anyone really understood the pain I was going through. Having to deal with depression and schooling at the same time was no joke. I unfortunately had severe anxiety and if my grade dropped lower than a C i would cry and pass out. I taught myself Math, History, English, literally everything in the fucking world. Because the support the school offered wasn't enough, when I asked for AP home schooling classes they denied me. I ended up being rejected from most Cal States and UCs because of that. I was so angry and frustrated, i felt humiliated in front of my peers. My Class Year had a 65% acceptance to UCs average. I felt completely lost.  The people I used to call my friends were attending Columbia, UCSB, UCLA, UCI. I cried so hard, it was impossible for me to feel better. 

Then I devised a plan to transfer to a UC in the future after spensing 2 years at a university. I entered the only Cal State that accepted me (I kind of regret it lol) and set the path towards my goal to transfer out. I wish someone in high school had informed me that I could have gone to community college and used TAG (transfeer admission guarantee). I had no idea that existed. My high school failed me big time. I guided myself where I went in life. I cried so many nights, and had no one to talk to. I felt compeltely alone and the help of my family wasn't much better either.

I've been volunteering as an ambassador for a charity for 12 years. (Not anymore) They took advantage of me when they tried to use me as a tax relief deposit in my first year of uni. They gifted me a BMW thst ended up being dog-shit. Like literally 250k miles, a bad motor, and a bad battery. And they wrote it off as a 5k gift to me in a tax form. I felt completrly betrayed but thsn I stood up for myself and refused to accept the car. I just felt so proud of myself for standing up against what they tried to make me do. It fueled me in my college years to keep going strong. I started studying more, looking up sources for CSU TO UC transfer. I still cried alot, but I felt at peace. I still dont have any friends but Im hoping to fix that one day. 

I applied for transfer to all UCs and USC for this Fall Semester 2021. I go waitlisted to UC Davis and UCSC for Political Science and I'm still waiting on UC San Diego and USC. It may not seem like much but the waitlist means the world to me to know that I am capable of going far beyond anyone's words and that my hardwork does pay off. I feel immensely proud of . Cal State Transfers are always last to be picked when it comes to transferring to another four year university so I literally jumped for joy at my odds defying everything I thought of previously. I feel like I can do anything. 

My parents were extremely toxic at some points and supportive in others. They have seen how much I suffered and I only hope with time they will realize that everything I've worked hard on happens for a reason. 

My depression and anxiety still exist, but I am hay to say I no longer feel that gut wrenching voice asking me if I even have a will to live. I still get severe panic attacks when I think about my rejection letters. I look back at my high school and middle school life and wish I was brave enough to face against the people who hurt me the most. I always promise myself that I will get past my hardships and hope to overcome everything I've suffered from.

Despite the lonely nights where I wish I had friends to play Valorant with or go to the movies with. I know maybe someday, i'll meet people who treat me nicely and support me. There's alot of paths I wish I took differently, but I can't change the past. I can only look toward my future. I know that life can be tough and you don't see yourself living past a certain point but everything gets easier with time. You don't need anyone but yourself to tell you that you're an amazing person and that you're capable of great things. You are an exceptional human being with great qualities and just because someone tells you something differently does not change the feelings you have for yourself. Your ambition is strong and it will drive you great places.

243,Florrmat,1619677578,/r/college/comments/n0ydte/doubting_my_academic_abilities/,"Hi everyone, I recently got admitted to my local CC and am planning to start in the fall. I’m immensely nervous to start college honestly, but it feels like the right decision for me and I also share a great deal of enthusiasm to start on top of all the butterflies I may have.

Backstory, graduated HS with a complete sham of a GPA, never tried, never applied myself ever, scraped by however I could. I’ve worked dead end jobs for 3 years and am so burnt out of customer service/retail work, I’ve decided to finally make the decision I know I needed to make. I took so much time off cause I truly was directionless, no idea what I wanted to do or if school was even necessary for me (considered trade school for a long time).

Something has been telling me I have a higher calling, and I want to believe that, but it’s hard for me. I’m a different person than I was in HS obviously, but I feel riddled with doubt about if I can even do what needs to be done. I want to work in healthcare, that’s what truly appeals to me. I admire doctors and nurses and aspire to be at that level. My plan right now is to try and pursue a nursing degree and hopefully go back to school at some point after and pursue higher education. 

Nothing else appeals to me and I don’t want to settle so I’m going all in and I’m ready, it’ll be a long road, but I’m ready. I’m also riddled with doubt, does anyone else have a story similar to this? 

I’ve never felt like an academic so all my talk of higher education seems very bold for someone who never passed High School Geometry. Crazy right? I want to make my parents proud, I want to help people and save lives, I just need to believe I have the ability. 

Sorry for the ramble, I just wanted to see if anyone has any similar stories, it’s hard for me to believe I could do any of this, but I want to.",college,Doubting my academic abilities.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/n0ydte/doubting_my_academic_abilities/,1619695578.0
244,ireallylike808s,1619562718,/r/college/comments/n00gt3/failed_all_but_one_class_my_graduating_semester/,"Let me just start off by saying I apologize for any typos or poor wording. My skin is broken out in red spots from anxiety and I feel like this is my last day alive on earth...

I was a great student growing up. Except for persistent math class issues, I was in Honors classes, AP, Dean’s list etc. 

I started my freshman year of college at IU Bloomington. Terrible experience, my roomate was such a bum he’d throw his dirty underwear on my bed nonchalantly. I made no friends, my social anxiety went through the roof. Everyone around me did hard drugs. I bombed. When I came back, my parents and I had some of the biggest arguments we ever had. I was diagnosed with major depression and ADHD. They refuse to believe it to this day and call me a loser whenever it gets brought up. 

Despite all this, I bounced back. I went to community college, and performed pretty well attaining A’s and B’s. I finally transferred to Columbia College Chicago starting January 2019 and I felt on top of my game. I consistently got all A’s and B’s, made deans list, and had a cumulative GPA of 3.75! I loved my classes and felt like I was breezing by as a result. 

Not to sound cliche but then COVID hit. Halfway through my first senior semester. I’m pretty ADD as stated before, and finally convinced my family to help get me medication to help me in school and all other aspects of my life. Helped immensely, and still does day to  day. But I started seeing trouble arise when my school switched entirely to online. See I was productive and extremely attentive in class, and was very motivated no matter the subject. Online, being stuck in my computer room all day, with a family who constantly verbally abused each other 24/7 and gets in routine shouting matches made me slip up. Nevertheless, I finished with all A’s and a B that semester. Partially because I had around half my semester in-person which saved me from early demise. 

Here’s where I my issues began. See my dad is really impatient. He’s from Europe and didn’t go to college. He stressed to me over and over again “you have to graduate this year end of story. It’s been too long I want you to load up right the f**k now and  finish.” Upon meeting with my advisor, I had five left to take at Columbia, and I had to complete a math and English class at my old community college which would transfer. 

Except the problem is the summer term of my community college began when my regular college was still in session. This math class (my worst subject) was already 3 weeks in. I had to get a special petition to sign up. My dad was like “DO IT HURRY UP”. I was doomed from the beginning. Being my worst subject, it didn’t help me that there was no instruction. It was just complete the homework and quizzes using the Pearson software. I tried my absolute best. Took so many notes, and would do bad on everything. Even the homework was graded for extreme accuracy. My professor in this class also said it wouldn’t be fair to have me make up any assignments I missed in the 2and a half weeks before I joined the class. 

This was when I had a major panic episode. I couldn’t talk, isolated and just worried to high Heaven. I tuned out. Went ghost. Right as my English class was to begin, which would’ve been super easy for me to pass. 

I mustered up the courage to finally reach out to my teachers and ask for help. Except just my luck the semester ended. So boom. I lost the chance to get the credits for those two classes. Already set up for disaster come the fall semester. 

My classes last semester at Columbia were no different than the classes I had excelled in. Only what happened at my CC loomed over me constantly. My parents constantly asked over and over again if I’m on track to graduate and I’d say yes over and over again. Had I said what happened at my CC I would’ve probably been beaten and tossed out the house. I know lying like this was bad but I have absolutely no way of supporting myself. My dad has access to my bank account, the car I drive is under him, etc. I had a severe bout of depression for the first time in 5 years since my semester at IU to where I completely disassociated from everything. My advisor would try and call me to ask if I was okay, as well as classmates I was in group projects with, and just seeing them reach out made me a nervous sorrowful wreck. I don’t know how to describe it but I couldn’t muster the courage to even respond to them. I’m in the same room day in day out trying to do school in this messed up household and the environment definitely has messed with my head. 

Well I was supposed to graduate assuming I passed those two CC classes and my Major-related classes. Mom was all excited, dad finally showed some sense of pride in me. I was not happy however. Because I didn’t. My one teacher was generous enough to give me a C, I got an F in the four other classes. My GPA is now a 2.7. Remarkably I’m still in “good standing” 

My dad has since insisted i apply for college grad entry level  jobs daily and I have been, using an amended resume where I say I’m short a few credits of graduating. He doesn’t know that. He would ask where my diploma was once or twice a week since January and I would just say “I don’t know yet they take forever to send out”. By the time he threatened me with “I better not have any bad surprises” it was too late. If I can go back in time and tell them during the semester I totally would believe me. 

Well today he lost his sh*t about it. Demanded I show him paperwork that I graduated. Transcripts, degree, something. I said I couldn’t and so he called a lady at my school who said my degree not being here yet was not normal. He sat me down and demanded I come clean. I tested the waters to where I said I may have gotten a C- in a class that was holding me back and he went into a rage. Slamming his fist on his desk, spitting everywhere whilst screaming, calling me a scumbag and that I will never get anything from them again. Broke my heart. Have had a mutually decent relationship for a while now. To have it return to this blows. Said “f you” to me whenever I tried to open my mouth and speak. He made me register an appointment with my old academic advisor for tomorrow at 2:30 where he will be listening along. I stealthily managed to explain to her in the notes when I scheduled the situation. And how he doesn’t understand how difficult it’s been for me. But I’m still worried sick how this is gonna go down. What is she gonna blatantly say I failed everything? I know it’s best to fess up with this stuff but I’m not in the situation where I can be like “oh they’re mad but they love me they’ll understand”. 

What kills me is this wasn’t a result of me being lazy. I literally transgressed into a withering panicked maniac in this house trying to just get my degree. With my family
Home 24/7. My dad used to always travel, kept the family dynamic relatively calm five days a week. Now it’s a shit show almost every day. All these factors have made me a terrible student even with my meds. I’m worried he will stop paying for my ADD meds which have helped me make my bed, rid myself of social anxiety, have a loving girlfriend, etc. mentally I don’t think my brain could handle such a change in chemistry right now. And to think that’s the least of my concerns...

Although, I’ve been struggling so much in my classes I’ve gotten good internships my freshman and sophomore summers. I’m now a sophomore and will be a junior in the fall.

After all of the assignments have been submitted and graded, it’s not even possible for me now to pass the same classes this semester. On top of it my electives classes are not shaping up for me to pass them.

All of my friends are geniuses and I don’t even tell them I struggle in school because I’m so embarrassed. They all are passing their classes and moving on but I struggle so much. It was nice when we took the same classes because we could work together but now I’m so far behind.

248,fromnowfromzero,1619227964,/r/college/comments/mx9y60/has_anyone_else_had_a_professor_like_this/,"Has anyone else had a professor that very obviously did not really care about the quality of the class? And made it clear that they don't really care about teaching it well, they made their course easy as possible on purpose?? And actually discouraged working hard because it wasn't necessary?

&amp;#x200B;

Because that's a professor I have right now and I am sincerely so confused. I have never had a teacher in any level of school like this. She seemed very nice in the beginning and then sort of turned when you actually go to know her more and take he up on her offers to help you. She would tell us that she is on our side, that if there's a grading discrepancy or any issues, she will side with us, that we have nothing to worry about, and that we will all do well in her class. She told us that there's no reason to fail her class; we will all do well if we do the work. Fair enough, we have all heard that before and it makes sense. Doing the work will of course, if you did it correctly, get you a good grade in a class. Because that's quite often how class works. But this lady is so different. I had gotten an accommodations letter from my school's disability department, and they gave it to me much later in the semester than they intended. But I thought I could still be able to give it to my teacher, even if it didn't do anything else but let her know that I'm dealing with some things that I may need like some extra patience  because of. When I asked her about how to get it to her and if I should send it at all sort of because the semester is near over, she literally, rudely asked me rhetorically what I would even need accommodations for.... This is not the first time she was rude to me either.

When I asked to talk to her about some questions I had about a few assignments and share a concern I had about our final project, she told me that I shouldn't be having any trouble because her class is so easy. It's just a few assignments, attendance, and a group project. Like why am I even stressed and worried at all? It's so simple. Why are you like this? That type of questioning is what came my way when I tried to get guidance from her on some homework. She literally told us over and over in class to reach out if we needed help. She also blamed me for one of my group members being absent and not contributing to the project when I told her that he would not answer any of our messages and basically went mia for a couple weeks. Which is what I was reaching out to her about, that I was concerned about this group project presentation. And she scolded me for ""not even bothering"" to send him a message to ask how he is doing, if he needs any helps, and whether he's alright........ Bruh...................................... We are all adults here. I'm not his mom. This is a group project and I can't send him a note on a freaking messenger hawk to contact him. My sole means of contact with him was rendered useless as he ignored my/the other group members messages. You guys, I am at the end of my rope. There were times I asked her about an assignment that she was like, ""This shouldn't be difficult. It's like, what, three paragraphs. Just get it done."" I would never talk to a student like that or anyone. Because that's so invalidating. If someone came to me asking for help/feedback/advice, I would never make them feel bad for even asking. I wouldn't basically say that ""this shouldn't be that hard."" I don't think I'm overreacting either because I've been extremely patient with her. But her hypocrisy and disorganization has just made me lose braincells. 

She insulted my intelligence and talked down to me when I had a meeting with her during her office hours. She took over a month to reply to my email(s) and then scolded me for not communicating well. And mind y'all, she is a COMMUNICATIONS professor. AND A THERPIST. When I asked questions that like were about my concerns or confusion on an assignment, like I already said, she told me that it's simple and to not do much, just basically do the bare minimum. I have never in my life had a teacher treat me like this. I wasn't taking it personally until her demeanor and tone and attitude changed completely between our phone call and class. We had our meeting over the phone before class that day, and she was just not pleasant to talk to and was talking to me like she was better than I was. And then in class, even when she said some similar things as far as the class being simple, her tone and everything was completely different! That is what brought me to the thought that she might just not like me. Not to sound insane, but I don't know if she feels threatened by me or what? I've never been impolite with her and I've done the best I can. I've been professional and clear in my emails. I followed her instructions and rules. But it sort of just meant nothing I guess. 

This is the same lady who didn't put up any due dates or assignments until we were like right on top of them because she ""didn't want us to worry or work ahead because she wants us to stay relaxed and not stress."" But that stressed the entire class out. We were eventually assignment a group project that we had literally no idea the due date for over a entire month. I've spoken to several people about this whole situation and their feelings align. This is so abnormal and it's a shame that she doesn't care. She isn't trying to teach and encourage her students to learn and do their best. She actively dragged me down and showed frustration as my willingness to do the work well. When I say do my best, I don't mean overachieve or just crazily go beyond what was asked of me. I wanted to do well though and learn. I value my education. I recognize that, as stressed and tired as I am, this is a privilege that I'm very thankful for. And I've just never dealt with a teacher like this. 

Not that I'd wish this on anyone else, but I'm not the only one who has has this type of experience, right?

\*\*\*

TL;DR: I have a professor who discourages doing your best while asserting that her class should be simple, so you shouldn't be confused or have any questions. She makes it clear that her class isn't a big deal while confusingly stressed the importance of the class subject. When asked questions, she gets frustrated and talks down to you despite your sincerity. She has an attitude and is hypocritical, preaching giving others endless benefit of the doubt, while then going and scolding me for not doing good enough after rejecting and shutting down my request for help. She said she made her class basically fool-proof so you shouldn't have any problem ever and if you do the  that's basically your own fault.

249,morenxlife,1618780693,/r/college/comments/mtlqj0/how_to_find_an_internship_advice_from_an/,"I’m making this because:

A) I’ve seen a lot of panicked posts realizing summer is quickly approaching and they haven’t really begun their internship search OR have received a lot of rejections.
B) In general, there are a lot of posts asking about where to look for internships.
C) I’m procrastinating on my homework. 

I’m not positioning myself as an all-knowing authority and I *hope* this doesn’t come across as unwanted, condescending advice. I’m sharing internship strategies, because as a student who was the first in my family to go through the American education system I didn’t have connections or anyone to show me how to do undertake the intimidating behemoth that is the internship process. 

So here are some of the tips and tricks I found out through trial and error: 

*Warning: a lot of these rely on LinkedIn so I recommend making an account. The first strategy I list is the one most helpful for me, but after that I don’t list it in any particular order of importance/effectiveness. 

Finding Companies and Internships

	1.	Please please please read this point carefully, because I never see this strategy recommended! There are organizations that are dedicated to creating internship opportunities for *specific* communities. There are organizations dedicated to placing people based on their identity (BIPOC, LGBTQ+, first generation, low-income, etc.), it can be location specific (ex: students from Oregon or who go to school in Oregon), it can be for people underrepresented in a specific field or industry (this depends entirely on the field), or a combination. In Portland, OR, Emerging Leaders PDX is a program that works hard to place students of color living in/attending school in Oregon with companies in the Portland/Portland metro/Vancouver area. Try and look for internships specific to your identity/community! 
	2.	Make a list of all the relevant organizations and companies in your college/university/home’s town/city/area. This is *super* helpful for finding places you can intern or work at during the school year, which is when the internship application process tends to be wayyyyyy less competitive. I did this, and I was able to go back and forth between my internship and classes fairly easily (the workload with an internship + school + anything else you have going on can be rough though, so keep that in mind). 
	3.	If you’re an upperclassmen I recommend repeating this process for all the places you’re interested in living after you graduate/wherever your graduate school is. 
	4.	LinkedIn is great for finding out where your peers work or where employees at your dream company have worked. I highly recommend combing through your LinkedIn network (or searching up your classmates if you don’t have a very large one) and going to their “Experience” section. After this, start cataloging the companies/organizations they’ve been involved in that interest you and follow those companies on LinkedIn. You can set up an alert for the company if they post a new job/internship opportunity on their LinkedIn page, though not all organizations use LinkedIn as their primary job posting site so make sure to check their actual website frequently.
	5.	This also works in reverse! Find all the companies you’re interested in interning/working at and find current employers and current interns under the organization page’s “Employees” tab. Make sure to look at what organizations they’ve worked/interned at before where they’re at now. I’m not saying to totally imitate someone’s career but A) it helps you understand what kind of experience your preferred company is looking for, and B) it will help you learn about other companies in your industry you may not have heard of before.
	6.	You should also try finding previous interns. This is a little harder since they aren’t featured under an organization’s LinkedIn page, but try searching up “company name + intern.” You can get more creative with the keywords if you’re looking at specific departments within the company. Some companies also publish the names of their previous interns on their website, so check there too. You may be wondering, “Why should I care about former interns at x company?” It’s not definitive, but looking at their career path after the internship indicates how much this internship opportunity helped them land their next job AND how many networking, mentorship, and professional opportunities the internship provides.  If you don’t ultimately end up working for a company full time after interning there, you’d still want to know how an internship at x company would benefit your career in the short and long term. And again, this will probably expose you to more companies in the field you haven’t heard of. 
	7.	Don’t forget to send LinkedIn invitations (I’ve never personalized them and it’s never been an issue but if you want to personalize it go ahead) to all the students/interns you’ve basically just stalked on LinkedIn. This is so when you apply to these companies you can reach out and ask for application/interview process advice and chat with them about their internship experience. 
	8.	You may feel embarrassed to admit you’re having a hard time finding an internship but don’t be afraid to make a LinkedIn post that says you’re looking for an internship in “x field” for “x term.” People can be very kind and give you advice or help get your foot in the door. I did this once and someone responded, leading me to my current internship! 
	9.	Take advantage of the resources your university has to offer - after all you ARE paying for it whether or not you actually utilize their services. Don’t just talk to career services (but yes, please check them out), colleges and universities offer so much more than that! Be sure to check if your school has some sort of major or college specific placement pipeline (like MECOP for engineering students); check calendars to see when they host career fairs, student-faculty mixers (this may not be a direct path to an internship, but it can help you find mentorship or get into a research position), and similar events; speak to professors and see if they have any connections or recommendations; speak to your major/college advisor and they may be able to provide you a list of organizations other students have interned at or have their own set of connections; connect with other people in your major/college and ask them about their internship experiences. 
	10.	Leadership and Mentorship programs - through your university or external organizations - are not only great for professional development, but they also connect you with other people in your field who are older and have more experience and/or allow you to meet other students with similar aspirations. Some programs may also have a direct pipeline to companies (ex: after you complete this program we will try to match you with an internship at x companies) or you can utilize connections you made to get referrals and other things that help with the internship application process. 
	11.	Use industry specific platforms. When internship and job hunting I’ve noticed people tend to recommend LinkedIn, Indeed, etc. which are useful platforms. HOWEVER, these are huuuuge sites that are inclusive of many industries and niches which makes sifting through job postings very time consuming. Ask coworkers, classmates, advisors, mentors, peers, and career center employees about the best job site platform for your industry - I especially recommend this for more niche majors/interests that have fewer job opportunities (like if you’re looking to go into museum curation). 
	12.	If you’re interested in micro-internships, which focus on short term projects go ahead and check out Parker Dewey. Personally, I haven’t tried this but my university has a partnership with them and there were some interesting projects available when I perused their site. 

When should I start looking for companies/internships?

This is entirely industry specific. Yes, large tech and business companies often start recruiting 2 terms/a year ahead (ex: apply in the fall of 2020 to secure a summer 2021 internship) but plenty of other fields and smaller companies do not practice this. If you didn’t apply in the fall for a summer internship or were rejected, there’s no reason to give up for the rest of the school year.

For humanities and some STEM majors, plenty of companies and organizations publish their internship applications late Winter to mid Spring (February to April). Is it nerve wracking to see soooo many students creating their LinkedIn posts announcing where they’ll be spending their summer in *December*? Yes, but that doesn’t mean it affects your internship opportunities at all. 

I’m studying PoliSci and Environmental Policy and I *just* secured my summer internship during the second week of April even though I started looking for internships/applying in January. My best friend is studying biochemistry (and focuses pretty much just on research) and has been applying from early March - April, and has not yet secured their summer internship. So please please please don’t lose hope just yet if you’re freaking out! 

As a general rule of thumb, I recommend starting an *intensive* search about 6 months before you want to intern (if you want a summer internship that starts June, this means start looking in January) so you can begin your application process early. 

Of course, adjust this schedule to fit your needs, but again, I just want to provide reassurance there’s no “right time” to start this process. When you’re not looking intensively - like just creating a running list of companies you might intern or work at someday - try to update this year round so you don’t have to make a mad dash every new internship season. 

I’m a Political Science and Environmental Policy major with minors in Public Health and Ethnic Studies who’s mostly interned at non-profits and government agencies, so I’m aware some of the advice I listed may be more helpful for humanities majors but I tried to be as broad as I could. If anyone has specific questions for polisci/public policy major please comment and I can try to answer. :) 

If this was helpful please let me know! I’m planning on making a whole Google doc (that will be completely free to access, I’m not trying to profit or anything) about this because I felt like all the advice available online was pretty generic and honestly not super helpful.

My mental health has been in the absolute gutter the past couple of months. I’m in a city school, staying off campus. The first semester, it was fairly easy to meet people. I had so much energy and really pushed myself to make a great group of friends. I even met a roommate for this semester as well!!

But then this semester came around. I had to move farther away from campus with someone I met earlier. I thought we would get along really well, as we were super close, but my roommate fell into a depressive episode and isolated themself from me. I tried not to take it personally, and continue to meet friends.

At the same time, my school has required me to take 17 credits and I also have been working a part time job. As a result, I’m super busy and always tired.

I continued to try and make/maintain friendships but it’s just been so hard. I have no energy. My grades are slowly declining, my mental health is shit, and I have maybe one or two friends in the whole city.

I’m moving back home to take time to rest and recuperate, but I’m worried that I’ve missed the prime time of my life to mingle and make friends. Or that I’ll never feel happy/good again.

I’m currently a sophomore at UW-Milwaukee (USA) and the time has come to declare a major because I’m running out of gen eds to take.

255,EagleAtlas,1617854840,/r/college/comments/mmjnmf/a_message_to_incoming_freshmen_from_a_senior_bio/,"The following is a list of tips that genuinely helped me over the last 4 years in university, and I hope some incoming freshmen can gain something from them as well. (Based on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/mmdid6/what_are_some_dorming_tips_youd_give_incoming/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share))    
    


1. **Go to your professors' office hours!**    

Try to make a habit of going to every one of your professors office hours at least once each week (even if it's on Zoom). This way they can learn who you are both as a student and as a person. That'll make it both easier for them to help you, and be more willing to help you (e.g. they may not take points/as many points away on quizzes and exams for topics they know you've been struggling with [this is not guaranteed, but I've personally experienced this at least one time every semester for the last 4 years]).    

Your professors want you to be interested in and learn the material as best as possible (well at least most of the professors I've had felt this way). If you show them that you're making a conscious effort to work hard and do well in their class, more than likely they'll reciprocate some, if not all, of that effort back into helping you. ""Helping"" could mean anything from spending a little extra time in office hours, to spending non-office hour days trying to help you through problem sets, to not taking points off for parts of assessments that you got incorrect (when other people would get points taken off for the same mistakes).    

(*Tangent*) Prior to COVID, I tried to make sure that I went to each of my professors office hours at least once a week. I started doing this for two reasons 1) because my father recommended it in our father son talk the night before my family took me to school, and 2) I felt awkward asking questions in front of large classes. Since COVID hit, I've personally found it harder to attend Zoom based office hours, even though I know I should.    

College can be incredibly intimidating at first, especially if you get stuck with rigid first year/semester professors. However, from personal experience, as long as you show them you're interested (even if you're not because it's some gen ed., just act like you are) they'll be very willing to help you. As they get to know how you learn and who you are as a person, they'll be able to explain things in ways that make more sense than they did during lectures/while reading the textbooks.    

2. **Try to sit in the front row of your class**, you might get picked to answer questions by the professor more often, but that will be an incentive to learn the material!    

3. **College is exactly what you make of it**    

College will be based on your mindset/outlook, and it will be exactly what you expect it to be, regardless of what your expectations are. 
*If you keep a nonchalant attitude, you'll see that even the most stressful challenges will come to pass. 
*If you came to party and chill, you'll have a great time... But try remember to submit your assignments prior to the night they're due. 
*If you're dedicated to working hard and trying to do the best you possibly can (i.e. me), it's okay to try and cool off every now and again, you don't need to work yourself to death before you even hit the workforce.    
The examples can continue forever.    

(*Tangent/Message to past me*) I can't tell you how many times I've heard this last point over the last 4 years, but it's true; I know that there are countless experiences that I let slip through the cracks because I felt as though I couldn't take a break from my work - do as I say, not as I do. If you're working hard, you'll do fine. So feel free to let loose every now and again, meet new people (literally, if you're given the chance to meet new people, do it; I don't mean just walk up to some random person with your hand outstretched and ask ""what's your name? My name's [name here]!"" that'll get weird looks... or pepper spray...), get out of the library/your dorm a every now and again if for no other reason than to get some sun and fresh air.    

4. **Try something out of your comfort zone!**    

This could mean answering a question in class, speaking to that person you find attractive, joining a club that seems interesting but deals with something you've never tried before, and the list goes on. However, this doesn't mean to try something that you find morally wrong, like if you're against doing drugs and alcohol, don't feel obligated to join in (peer pressure is not like it is in movies, or how high school taught it, but it is still a thing); but also, don't try to tell everyone that they shouldn't be doing it because you don't think it's okay (unless it involves hurting another person, then you have every right to speak up).    

5. **Don't feel shy, ask other people if you can hang with them!**    

If a person's door is open in your hall, and you see people hanging out, feel free to knock and ask if you can hang with them. If that group doesn't turn out to be your crowd, just continue this process until you find the right people. The ""right people"" may not be in your hall, or maybe in your building, just try to open yourself up to talk to people and you'll find your best friends eventually :)    

If it just so happens that you were the only one from your high school to go to your university and your feeling like an outcast, use that as your literal opening line. (Preface, in high school I was very shy, I wasn't against talking to others, but I struggled to initiate conversations with new people) This is how I felt when I first went to school, the last person from my high school that went to this university graduated 12 years prior to me starting. On my first day, I saw a small group of people talking and laughing together outside my building, so with the help of my father's words from the night prior, I mustered up the courage to walk over and just introduce myself. To the best of my recollection this is what I said (or at least something very close to it): ""I'm sorry for interrupting, but my name's Daniel. I don't know anyone so I was wondering if I could hangout with you guys?"" They welcomed me with open arms, stating that they were the exact same. That one interaction has stuck with me more than really any other, because it showed me that it's not that challenging to talk to others, you just need to muster up some confidence (even if, in the back of your mind, you're freaking out).    
    

All in all, good luck. This is a crazy world we're living in, who knows what could happen over the next 4 years. Also, if you read all of this, good job!

I don't know if it'll actually make me feel better, but if anyone else feels the same I'd like to know. Just the feeling of knowing I'm not the only one is enough. I thought I'd just say I'm nonbinary and go by they/them pronouns. 

So I'm 20 years old, almost 21, and a junior in a 4 year university with no plans to go to graduate school. My major is cinema, and lately I've been having trouble with that fact. Now I've always loved my major. I can't see myself doing anything else. I've been so overwhelmed and stressed, I feel like I'm starting to hate my major. I never thought something like this would happen because I only just got into cinema, and I feel like I still haven't found the thing about it that I love the most. Basically, I feel like I haven't loved cinema enough, I was just getting started. It's been my major since freshman year, and I chose it because a professor inspired me and made me feel like I could actually do this. Unfortunately, due to covid and the department director, that professor is no longer teaching at my school. I've lost all contact with them sadly. I think this has greatly affected my love for the major. Since she left, I've felt like my enjoyment of cinema and the classes has been subdued. We were really close (this professor and me), and I really enjoyed our talks about movies and talking in general. I learned most of what I know of cinema from this professor. Sorry for talking so much about this one facet, but this has been very important to me for the years I've spent in college. To believe that I don't care for it anymore has really been messing with my sense of identity.

I was taking 4 4-credit courses until earlier this morning. I dropped a course today because it's been causing me so much mental anguish, stress, and anxiety, I just couldn't do it anymore. I don't think dropping that class is going to solve my issue though. If anything, I'll update on how I'm feeling after dropping that class. Maybe in a week or two, I'll feel better. Regardless, each semester since we've started learning online has felt like more and more of a struggle. I remember having my first panic attack on my birthday last spring semester. That whole day was spent stressing over a paper I had due, and I remember only being able to send it in 5 days later. Worst birthday ever lol. At the time, I was talking to a girl who eventually became my gf for a point in time, and she helped me through it. After that, I had more panic attacks this fall semester. I was dating the same girl I had been talking to, and she helped again, but I think it was too much. My mood was irritable most of the time because of stress, and I would have multiple breakdowns each week. There were times when I would just start crying because I felt overwhelmed. Fast forward to now, I am single, and due to this recent relationship and its abrupt ending, I am having a hard time being vulnerable with my feelings and trusting people. This relationship has changed me as an individual as it has greatly affected me and the way I interact with people. I have been crying practically everyday due to stress and just an overall feeling of being extremely overwhelmed with no escape. I find myself wondering a lot if I will ever be free from this feeling.

The point is, I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to about my feelings of potential burn out, stress, and anxiety. I don't like talking to my friends because I don't want to burden them with the way I feel. They try their best to be positive with me, but when it doesn't work, I just feel worse because I feel bad that they tried and still can't get through to me. When I talk to my parents, I don't feel any better. They tell me that I'm almost done so I can't put all the money they've put into my education, to waste. So I'm unable to drop out or take a semester off. I don't know if time off would even help honestly. Whenever I'm on break, I'm able to start feeling better, but after some time in school, I'm back to where I was before, or worse off. Each semester, the time I had before I would reach my limit would decrease. I lasted about 3 months into the semester last spring, a month and a half this fall semester, and 3 weeks this semester. I haven't felt this semester at all since the beginning, so I feel very far past my limit.

I think I should just say how I'm feeling overall. In general, I feel like shit. I have been severely depressed for a little over a month and a half now. I'm not really sure what exactly triggered it honestly. I hadn't been this depressed since high school. I thought I'd gotten better because I had become more spiritual during the beginning of quarantine up until my breakup. After the breakup, I was very down, but this feeling is somehow 100x worse. I feel so pessimistic, hopeless, worthless. I worry very often that I will amount to nothing in life. I hadn't had suicidal thoughts since my freshman year of high school. I stopped thinking that way so long ago, and this past semester was able to bring it out of me again. It's very demoralizing feeling like all my hard work on myself from over the years was undone in what seems like a second. Before dropping my class, I just felt very overwhelmed with the workload of all my classes. Granted, if I had gotten through this week, the workload would have lessened a lot because it's midterms week. I just couldn't do it. I have so much trouble focusing and thinking in general, nothing is coming to me. When I read for classes, I get nothing out of it, I can't remember anything. Writing essays is a literal nightmare, and it's most of what I've had to do as work. I have no mental or physical energy for it ever. No matter what I do, I just feel like nothing matters at all. I worry about feeling this way all my life, like what if it's not just school making me feel this way and work will eventually do the same. Am I just stuck in this cycle? Anyways, everything I loved to do, I've lost interest in over the past month. I don't do it anymore with passion. Everything feels like I'm wasting time if I'm not doing my schoolwork. I've also been battling with negative self talk, which also started up again for the first time since high school about a month ago. 

I've been trying to get help to solve my problems, but everything has been taking too long. I am very certain I have ADHD and I'm realizing more things every day that can be explained by it. I'm trying to get tested for it so I can get treated, but it's taking such a long time. Firstly, I couldn't afford it for a while since it's a great deal of money to get tested at my school (roughly half a grand, but I saved for a few months). I don't have a primary doctor that I can go to instead because I'm living near my school. My living situation is just really complicated. I don't really have the time to tell you guys my life story, but I'm just not able to get a doctor out here, and I don't know when I can go to a doctor again. I'm also setting up an appointment with my therapist again. I went to therapy for roughly a year, but it yielded very few results. I didn't want to waste my time, but I decided to try it again because if not anything else, I at least know I won't be judged for talking about how I feel. This feels urgent to me, but others quickly tend to invalidate my feelings. Since I'm so used to others invalidating the way I feel, I don't even know if I'm being dramatic or if this is something that is actually serious. This is why seeing if other people feel the same would help. 

Thank you for reading, I really appreciate it. I hope if any of you are going through the same thing, that you're able to get out of this pit soon. Wishing you all the best. I will most likely update this post in the future with how I feel in a few weeks.

TLDR: I've been feeling very overwhelmed and stressed over online school. I might be going through burnout, but I don't see a way to stop it because I'm unable to take a break. I've been trying my best to get help and get back on my feet, but everything feels hopeless. I can't find motivation for the things I love anymore. I just feel numb. Does anyone else feel the same?

College is approaching for me this fall and with that comes a lot of excitement (and worries) about everything to do. One thing I’ve always wanted to do in high school but never had the chance was theatre. I’d like to do it in college especially since the school I’m going to has a whole club for it, but my biggest concern is whether or not college is generally a place where theatre is more accessible, because that’s the reason I didn’t join my high school’s club for it. I have autism, adhd, and crippling social anxiety, which all combine to make a blend of awkwardness, forgetfulness, and a tendency to melt under pressure unfortunately.

The guy friends i do make always try to advance on me physically which makes me feel even more like shit , i’ve been here two weeks and i’ve (halfway bc not exactly sex) hooked up with two dudes already. the one i actually liked a lot basically ghosted. 
I’ve only hung out with my two roommates and her boyfriend , which is great but i still feel like the black sheep just because they’ve had that foundation for their friendship and i’m the new one i guess. i love them but i can just feel it. 
i thought i made a friend the other day but he tried to make advances on me and i had to literally hit his hand away. so there’s that. 

on top of this , i have online school (which i cheat on because teaching myself enough content for 3 quizzes in one day is fucking hard) . i got a job at marshalls and they put me on the schedule for 1-10pm tomorrow but my mental health is deteriorating so badly and calling out before 2 weeks notice is really bad unless you’re sick so I basically have no choice but to stand for 9 hours tomorrow.

i’m just really stressed and lonely , i read a psychology problem and immediately had a mental breakdown panic attack where i was coughing and hyperventilating for an hour .

I'm a sophomore taking a research writing class that's required for my major (civil engineering) and I pretty much have fallen too far behind to catch up. After the trainwreck of last semester, I told myself I would do much better this semester but I guess my mental issues decided to take over again. I tried really hard to keep going in the course (and the other 3 classes that I'm taking) but now I just don't think I have the mental stability to write the 15-20 page single-spaced paper due at the end of the semester. I've already reached out to the counseling services at my university and I'm scheduled to speak to a therapist there once a week. So now that I've secured that, I want to give enough attention to my mental recovery for the rest of the semester.

As for the writing class, I've constantly been submitting poor work which I feel really bad about, but I just don't have the same energy that I used to when the pandemic was just starting (I know many many students are feeling this way). I could withdraw from the class, but the deadline passed last Monday and I unfortunately didn't make this decision on time, which is why I ask you guys if you think it's a good idea for me to just take the F, convert it to NC so that it won't murder my GPA, (my university has offered Pass/NoCredit for this semester) and retake the class in a semester in which I'm more prepared to keep up with the workload. I don't have any plans to go to grad school, and I've already spoken to my advisor who told me that engineering employers won't look down on one bad semester that took place in the middle of the pandemic.

I've also emailed two deans last week about my situation, but they've yet to reply. So what do you guys think I should do? Am I overthinking all of this?",college,Getting an F in a class on purpose?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/mfal2y/getting_an_f_in_a_class_on_purpose/,1616985429.0

A lot of my friends are getting into these great schools like Gonzaga, University of Washington, Columbia, and others. My childhood best friend from when we were 3 years old just committed to University of San Diego. I don’t want to say that I’m “stuck” going to a state school, but that’s definitely how I feel. It’s just a little off putting to see some of my closest friends going to away to sunny beaches, Ivy League, and other really good places, and I’ll be in some town out in BFE. There also weren’t any scholarships I received since my parents make “too much money”, and I don’t excel in any academics or athletics. This still puts a lot of pressure on my family because even though they make their fair share of money, it will be difficult to pay nonetheless. It feels like the only reason I’m even getting the chance to go to school is because of how much they make, which really puts me down.

For some context, I attended and are still attending an Indian art/multimedia school (which has a branch in my country) I signed up for back in 2018. It was the easy but expensive choice, as I was too damn dumb to even dream of being admitted to state colleges. So off I went with my decision.

It consists of 4 semesters (for my Advanced Diploma): Graphics Design, Web UI/UX, Cinematography and 3D Animation. Here is my problem: I fucking hate Web UI/UX with a passion. While I've already done Graphic Design and can't wait until I transitioned to Cinematography and 3D Animation - because those are actually the reasons why I signed up for this school. 

I'll admit, I'm terrible at coding/programming ever since I was a 13, my dad ever had an IT dude came over and did all the homework for me because I was too dumb to figure it out. Programming was never my forte, I can't imagine myself using HTML and CSS when I couldn't and still can't even code 1 line of Pascal. And now it's been two years of me stuggling to pass the second semester. I couldn't get myself to understand UI/UX no matter how hard I tried and had to retake most if not all the courses and still couldn't pass most of them. Out of 11 courses I have only complete one and it tooks me 2 takes to get it right...FOR TWO YEARS, jesus how stupid can I be? I feel like an ancient ape walking amongst a civilized society. I can't understand, why it's always like this? I'm always that one helpless child that got lost behind.

With that amount of time people who used to study at the same rate as I did in the first Semester, they had already complete 4 semester and on their way getting their diploma already(because a semester is only 6 months). WHILE I'M STUCK HERE FOR 2 YEARS JUST BECAUSE OF SOME CODES.

What should I do? Keep on trying or just give up at this point (I'm half my foot into that hole already). I've the option, the option to skip this shit entirely and move on to the next semester, right now. But then I will never get my Advanced Diploma in Multimedia if I haven't complete all the courses. I reckon I'll put it all behind me and try to somehow finish them once I had finished the 3rd and 4th semesters, but given an unintelligent dumbo whom is me, I don't think I'll ever finish those course.",college,I need help.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/m6otfp/i_need_help/,1615962530.0

As a student leader in my volunteer org this semester it became hard to create community amongst our members. We are in the rough situation in which we operate as an essential service nonprofit run by volunteers in our org. This year we saw a large growth in membership of our org but we saw a decrease in activity of members actually volunteering. In the past we had about 1 in person social a month and we have tried to do something similar this year but virtual. Though our member chair seems to have taken a backseat role and has stopped putting effort in. Though this is not about them. Next year I am moving into the head president position our org (I am currently one of the supporting leaders but not the vice or head president).  

I feel like at the root of it people join orgs especially during covid to meet people. And with our dismal effort this year we really dropped the ball and many members have become inactive and thus we have a problem filling volunteer spots for our nonprofit openings. What are some ways that y'all successfully built community this year to show members they're more than just a number and more than just another volunteer? Hopefully with vaccinations apparently said to ramp up in distribution this summer we'll be able to be in person by 2022 but I feel like atleast a portion of the fall will be online only for large groups of people. So as I prepare for the next school year I want to start the year off right and be able to transfer some good ideas to start with for my future member chair. Also I currently lead a committee within the org and I would love to apply some ideas there. All answers will be noted and appreciated.

Some Ideas I can contribute that worked well

\- hangout sessions where members can meet in small groups and talk with no ""social script"" happening. Just genuine conversations. 

\- Game nights: We've played codenames (this is a member favorite), scribblio (depends on the group some really like it others really don't), Among us (worked for 1 or 2 times but after the excitement wore off typically the only people who liked playing were those who played all the time, also I felt like it weird to accuse/lie to complete strangers)

Other things we tried but failed:

Needless to say the pandemic has been hard for everyone, especially those suffering mental health issues. I definitely have not been handling online learning very well, I am diagnosed with ADHD, depression, anxiety and dyslexia. No matter how hard I try I am not able to stay focused or engaged in online learning. When I was going to school on campus I did very well in all my classes and received good grades as well. Since the pandemic started I have retaken this chem class three times now, and still am not getting the material. It has become so bad that this semester I decided to add only this chem class to my schedule and focus all my attention on this one class. I’m still doing horribly in it and I’m feel like shit that at my age, I have made no progress in my academic career. 

To give you a little back story about myself as a student, I started my academic career when I was 18 and pursued a degree in nursing. I did this mainly to make my parents happy and because a nurse’s salary is supposed to be great. I didn’t end up getting into the nursing program and decided to move out to California with my boyfriend at the time to start a new life. I tried again to get into a nursing program out there and still didn’t get in. My grades were decent, but I could tell I did not have motivation and drive to be a nurse. I felt very lost at this point in my life, I was 23 at the time. I was going through a break up and felt like I had nothing going for me. At this low point I decided to do an ayahuasca ceremony and a 500 hour yoga teacher training. I felt like I found my calling. After my ceremony and teacher training, I choose to pursue a degree in nutrition. I ended up moving back to Colorado and the first semester went great at my new school, but then Covid happened.

Fast forward to now, I feel like I’m so behind in my academic career and I’m just throwing money away on these loans I’m having to take out to pay for school. I’m failing all these classes and I’m lying to my friends and family about it. A part of my feels like I need to change to another major that is easier and that I can finish fairly quickly since I’m 25.

I barely tried, especially during senior year and on my SAT; instead of studying and doing homework I was fixated on games and the internet. This culminated in me starting classes at a community college before dropping out because I didn't care. Until very recently I convinced myself I was a lazy POS, but now it's harder for me to discern how much was my fault because I'm coming around to acknowledging likely but undiagnosed depression, ADHD, high functioning autism or some combination of those that probably played a role. Either way, I'm at 3 years since HS graduation, 3 years spent unproductively and wondering what's wrong with me, and am starting to have motivation again. I hope to double down and try again despite all my failings, I guess. The issue now is my tanked GPA from HS + the unfinished term at community college. It's low enough that I've basically no hope in applying via common app for any college. I suppose the next best thing might be to bite the bullet and return to community college but even if I completed my work there and transferred to a senior college it'd be 6+ years by the end of it. But maybe that's the best option? The exception is those programs that allow you to take 2 years of CC then transfer for the last 2 years of another college... which my local CC has but is only for first-time freshmen. Hating myself for not doing that in the first place because now I'm ineligible. I'd assume some other CCs in my area might have similar programs but I'm not sure if the ""first-time"" rule counts any college you attended previously, in which case I'd be out of luck. I'd have to research more but if anyone has advice on this front let me know.  


My head's a bit all over the place when it comes to this stuff if you can't already tell. But I'm weighing any option I can think of, whether it's an accredited online uni that would forgive an awful transcript/doesn't require one (but idk if something like that exists that isn't a total waste), or colleges that offer alternative applications (not requiring a transcript, or if it does it's at least not factored in). Or, of course, going back to CC and figuring it out from there, which I'm kind of hoping it doesn't come down to as I fear that long road would make me feel like even more of a failure. I think I've got a better handle on my mental health though and could commit myself to working hard, and money is also hardly an issue. It's mainly my GPA biting me in the ass. Anyway, thanks for listening to me ramble and any insight into what you'd do in my position is appreciated.

In high school I was in class around 9-10 months out of the year, 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, which is about 40 hours, not counting time spent in after school, studying, or make up/extra classes.

College I have about 15 hours of class total per week. That’s a 25 hour difference. If I studied 25 hours per week in college, Based off how things are going, I’d more than likely be a consistent A student.( I get good grades, but because I don’t have good study habits it’s way more self- stressful). That’s not even counting that college is only 7 months for me. The breaks are way longer. Winter break for me was a month and a half. Working adults barely get that much time off, and add in the fact we get summer break too it beats out high school students.

I think the hard part is forcing yourself to put in the time. Unlike in high school, you don’t have to follow a set schedule. And yea, a lot of people never had to work or put effort in high school, but at least it’s less of a time commitment.

But I have been putting all his hard work and sacrifice to waste and I failed my 2nd 3rd &amp; 4th semester at uni. My 2nd sem at uni was when everything started going downhill. My mental health was deteriorating, I was struggling to stay focused on school, and I felt so lonely with the lack of friends. My daily routine was wake up, go to class, go straight home, play video games/watch anime, then sleep. My lifestyle has been like that since I was a high schooler(I’m 21 now). 

I had terrible grades from 2nd sem thru 4th sem. I kept telling myself every semester that I would redeem myself and get my grades up but I couldn’t get myself to do it. It spiraled down even further when I had to dropout of my 3rd semester because of health problems and I went blind in my right eye. I still haven’t recovered mentally from my vision loss. I was a semester behind and I didn’t feel like going to college anymore. It was just the same thing day in day out. I bombed my grades with all Fs. Tried again on my 4th semester and if I didn’t pass I would be suspended for a year. I’ve wasted so much of my dads money on college and I just kept failing. During 4th sem I just skipped classes midway through and just gave up. Whenever my parents asked for my grades, I would just send them a photoshopped image of A’s and B’s and telling them I was doing fine. Online school became too difficult to focus on when I already had a hard time focusing in classes. Getting a degree wasn’t something I was striving for and I only attended college because my parents wanted me to.

It has been a month since I attended uni and I feel it’s too late to contact any of the staff there. My dad received a letter saying I wouldn’t receive benefits anymore due to not meeting grades and absences. I told him I was still attending classes but I don’t know if I can keep up with so many lies. He’s coming back home in a couple hours and I feel like he wants to ask me about the letter but I don’t know what to do. Help?

274,jalisterj,1613254459,/r/college/comments/ljanlg/advice_needed_on_a_decision_go_back_home_to/,"Hi guys, title says all so I'll jump right into it. Looking for honest opinions, advice, what would you do if it were you, etc.

So I recently moved back into college for the spring semester after almost a year of being home because of Covid. My fall semester was online. I am an upperclassman. About half the student population has come back to campus and half has stayed remote. 

Some background: I usually get homesick when I come here, but it's made better by hanging with friends, jumping into my clubs and organizations, having a break to go home to look forward to, and having my parents visiting to look forward to. 

Covid has taken all that away. My parents aren't allowed to visit. We are allowed to hang out with friends in small groups but, at this level, are kind of discouraged from doing it. Also at this level we are not allowed to go into each other's dorms to hang out. We will be at the later levels but only two visitors are allowed per apartment/suite. My college is taking Covid seriously and believe me, I'm grateful for that. But the restrictions are definitely getting to me. 

(Right now, probably since it's the beginning, they're being cautious. They tested everyone when they got here and only found one Covid case. And yet, we're still at a moderate alert level where we can't hang out in each other's dorms.)

Also, my best friend and roommate from last year is doing classes remotely so they are not here with me. I am living with some really nice people who I kind of know, but some of them are friends. I do hang out with them as much as I can, but I try to balance getting healthy socialization with not crashing their party. (I know how annoying it can be when you just want to hang with your friends and that one other person you don't really know is there.) 

All these things have made it really hard on me. I've cried every day since I've gotten here, which honestly feels ridiculous to me because I'm not a freshman. (I have talked to a counselor about all this as well) Calling my parents is usually the highlight of my day. I obsessively count down the minutes until my next zoom call or short meet-up with my friends. The weather (I'm in the northeast) definitely hasn't been helping. There's a foot of snow on the ground and it's always cloudy, rainy, or snowing. I've been obsessively checking the forecast. 

I have never been really enthusiastic about this school or coming here. What makes it better is hanging out with people and getting to engage in my clubs. I have my clubs, but they're all virtual and it's not the same. 

One of the reasons I came back here is because my good friend is a senior and I felt like I needed to spend her last semester on campus with her. Another reason is that I hoped the workload would be lighter but it really isn't turning out to be, especially with the courses I'm taking.  

I know if things were normal, I wouldn't have the option to go home. However, if things were normal, I probably wouldn't be feeling this way in the first place. 

My parents are definitely open to the idea of me coming home, but they are also fine with me staying. They want me to make whatever decision is best for me. (Even though I know my mom would secretly love it if I came home).

At home, I have my neighbors I can hang out with whenever I want. I can go wherever I want. 

I'm trying not to make a decision based on how I feel at the moment. Because I do have good moments where I think, ""How could I leave?"" 

Here's where I really get caught:  
\-I'd be really embarrassed if I went home in the middle of the semester. My school is small and people talk. I wouldn't want to be the only one doing it. And I'd feel so bad telling my roommates. I do have a plan to tell them that it's because of family issues rather than admitting that it's because of my mental health, that way they won't question it or think it was their fault etc. 

\-If I do go home, I'd feel like I failed. I'd feel really guilty. I'd feel like I gave up. What if I regret it? Although I'd definitely been able to deal with the regret when I'm home. (Once I go home I won't be allowed to come back to campus)

\-If I go home, what if I miss out on things getting better? I'm worried that they actually will start to allow clubs to gather in-person outside once the weather is nicer. I wonder if it is really worth it though. Like, if I don't have that much fun here in the first place why do it? 

\-Beforehand I felt really guilty about leaving my senior friend, but now I realize that I'm not the only person who is important to her. She is living in a suite with some of her good friends. She has said to my friend who is remote that she'd rather see her happy at home than nervous/sad on campus and I know she'd say the same thing for me, at the same time being sad to see me go. 

\-I know I can learn lessons about pushing through, making new friends,  etc. but is it really worth it in the long run? I have the opportunity to learn the same lessons next year, as I'll still be in college then and I plan to have a similar living arrangement as this year. 

All in all, I'm really mad at myself. I wish I'd just made the decision to stay home so I didn't have to come here and leave a mess in my wake if I leave. My parents suggested that I make a decision by this Friday, the 19th, and they'd be here to pick me up. I'm thinking that maybe I should stay until March when this shitty weather lets up. And honestly, my mom and I have made plans for her to visit at the end of the month even though it's technically not allowed. She wouldn't come on campus, I would go to her and we'd probably just hang out in the car all day. But then again I kind of don't want here coming here too much because I'm scared she'll get Covid. I know she'd be safe, but I'd never forgive myself. 

\-I'm afraid that I will feel better and choose to stay. Not really sure why I'm afraid of feeling better, but I guess the thought of staying here a while is really daunting. And if I do stay, it'd probably require visits from my mom, which I'm nervous about for the reasons I mentioned.

I've been obsessing over this decision all week. I wish something would happen to make it for me. It's almost all I can think about. I've tried not to, but I have an obsessive form of anxiety so it's really hard to refrain. I am meeting with the counselor I talked to again this week. And not knowing what we're going to be allowed to do in the future kills me.  

I'm also afraid that I'm too deadset on going home and that I've already made the decision. I know it sounds like i have already. Going home is what I want at my core but like, I always want to go home, you know? 

Heck, I might even feel better and choose to go home anyways. Would that be logical?

I've had this hatred towards school for a long time but I feel like it has been amplified. I've talked to other people about this and they too also have a hatred towards school but no one else is as passionate about this hatred as I am lol. I've tried hard to stay in school but almost every ounce of me wants to drop out and just start a business or work a blue collar job for the rest of my life. Not to say that there is anything bad with either of those, I just feel like I would enjoy it more. I hate the idea of going to school just to be able to compete for a 9-5 corporate job. I hate how no professor is passionate about teaching their subjects and just offer the same mediocre lesson plans. Not to mention my parents are paying an arm and a leg supporting these institutions and unpassionate professors that, in the grand scheme of things, just want your money. All for a piece of paper that says your capable in what ever field you majored in.

Now I understand that this piece of paper does lead to more success financially because I will admit, for someone of a lower socioeconomic class, going to college will almost guarantee you more money in the long run. This post is not to crap on anyone who is going to college but mentally, I just can't. I need to be passionate about something in order to do good, and what good is it when no one is passionate about the things they teach. I want to better myself financially in life, but it just kills me that the majority of my classes for my major are catered to a corporate/office setting. By no means am I taking a hard major either, (business admin in management). I feel like university kills creativity for me. It's hard for me to pay attention in class. I barely study. Everyone says, ""It's just temporary,"" but I've honestly felt this emotion all my years in school and even more so now.

Not to mention I've never really been given or had any sense of direction on what I wanted to do in life. If I were to drop out right now, I have some ideas on what I could do with my life but my parents would be disappointed in me for dropping out. I hate thinking about it because my parents both grew up in a not so nice areas in South America and took a risk to move to North America to give me and my sibling a better future. I just feel like I'm wasting this opportunity they gave me. On the other hand I literally hate school so much. When I'm out of school I feel more creative, happier, and overall a entrepreneurial person. When I'm in school, I just hate every second of it and become angry and frustrated with life.

I was supposed to travel back to school on the 17th (Had to go back to my home country because my student visa expired and I needed to renew it before the next semester), but something came up, and my dad said I couldn't go. My flight was moved to the 31st of January, and I had to do the first two weeks of classes at home.

It was a horrible experience as I didn't have the available resources. This semester, my classes are all maths and stats-based, so I needed notebooks and other calculation materials. There was also an issue with the internet connection that I found it hard to access blackboard and my classes. The time difference was also an issue. Overall the situation was terrible.

I bought a notebook for the classes, but it was so disorganized, I couldn't focus, and my family didn't make anything more manageable for me. They didn't care. I had classes, and I was asked to do many chores, leaving me exhausted before the zoom meetings started. 

I arrived in the U.S yesterday and already bought notebooks and other materials needed for the class, but I feel overwhelmed with the amount of content I have to do.

278,donteatsleep,1612116643,/r/college/comments/l9i0r8/ive_been_placed_on_academic_dismissal_at_a/,"Before I realized I was on academic dismissal I made an appointment with a counselor and came up with an education plan for the next 5 semesters, and I planned on transferring afterwards. When I tried to register for courses I noticed that I was on academic dismissal and I honestly feel like I have no real excuses.

I started attending college right after high school because my parents pushed me to do so. I wasn’t ready for it, and I’ve been failing courses every semester. Now that I feel motivated and confident enough to attend, I’ve been dismissed. I know that I want to attend college for myself now, and not my parents, but they will be so mad if I’m not reinstated. I don’t even know if I’ll be allowed to live here anymore. 

I do suffer from some type of anxiety, which made it hard for me to ask for help and make appointments with my professors and counselors. Depression also runs in my family, but my parents won’t allow me to get diagnosed. I have been trying to get diagnosed and go to therapy ever since I was 13, but my parents have kept my insurance card locked away and they believe that daily exercise and vitamins will fix all of my problems. I feel so isolated in this situation. I have no diagnosis to prove that I go through this stuff, and if I do bring it up in my letter, I doubt they will let me come back because I’m not receiving any help. I have been pushing myself on my own and doing things that make me uncomfortable. 

I should have stood up for myself and told my parents I wasn’t ready. Now that I am, I feel like my appeal letter will not reflect that because I haven’t sat out and proved that I am ready to be reinstated. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to blame my parents in my appeal letter. I know that it’s ultimately my fault that I wasn’t performing well. But I don’t know how else to say that I did so bad because I wasn’t ready and now I am. I don’t know what to put in my letter. I feel so shallow.

Is there any hope for me in this situation? I really want an education at this college and I am ready to take it seriously. I have a list of all the steps I am going to take if I’m reinstated, but I have no excuses besides my lack of motivation and not being ready.

Here is what I have written down so far to ensure my success if I’m reinstated:
- made an education plan with my counselor and will check in with her regularly 
- will make use of recourses offered at the college
- will start managing my time better, and make studying and completing assignments my top priority
- communicate with instructors to make sure I understand what is expected of me
- if I notice myself falling behind I will make use of tutoring resources",college,"I’ve been placed on academic dismissal at a community college and I’m planning on writing an appeal letter, but I feel like I won’t be reinstated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/l9i0r8/ive_been_placed_on_academic_dismissal_at_a/,1612134643.0

Plus i had some social anxiety issues and presentations and stuff are really scary to me. I cant think how it would have been if classes werent online as my social anxiety would be 10 times worse if it was face to face.

i cant function since last wednesday. i cant eat properly, i want to sleep all the time and i am in a extremely bad mood in general. if my mom hadn't tried to support me i would have been even worse. 

I am in a better shape than 99 percent of my generation in terms of future objectively.

I'm wanting to go to college relating to a forest science major, but I have been basically practicing to be an art major since high school. I fear that I may not be ""smart"" enough for my degree of choice.   


Since high school I was set on the path to become an artist, go to school in Florida or Georgia, and that be that with all of the art school debt that comes with it. For a while I was completely fine with that until after I graduated community college and now I am questioning it. I haven't applied to these schools and actually have my education on hold at the moment to help my family out during the pandemic. During this time I have sort of came to mind that I don't really think I want to get an art degree. I enjoy making art, but id rather it as a hobby and maybe do commissions than try to make a full blown career out of it. 

In the last 6 months, I began realizing I have a bigger love for nature than I previously thought and I began looking at degrees around that. I found a degree for Rangeland and Forest Management and after reading through what the degree requires and what careers it could lead me to, I began to really fall in love with it, but also became extremely intimidated due to it being a total 180 of what I was raised to basically do. I'm not the best at science and math, but I'm also not the worse. I may end up struggling a little bit with this program cause I basically was told growing up by friends and by some teachers to not really worry about science or math cause I'm going for the arts so I never tried extremely hard in those classes (I ended up with B's and I think 1 C).

I’m also going through heightened physical and mental health issues right now, so its kinda the perfect time to take a break and focus on me. It just sucks knowing that graduation would be postponed at least a semester (maybe more). I hate this. I also have the pressure of my parents and other family members that donated their time and money for my schooling.

Before this, i was doing fine, ive had some difficulties balancing school and personal time being away from home and living off campus for 2 years, living with not the most compatible roommate (different story), ive had a few failed subjects but generally, i can catch up to my batch’s regular load.

When the pandemic hit, I had to move back home because; 
(1) my parents said so.. there were way more COVID positive in the city compared to the almost 0 cases for much of the rural area where my hometown is, 
(2) it was getting hard sourcing my food in the early weeks of the quarantine, i had limited amout of food stored, a handful of facemask and no where to buy more, basically i was having a hard time “living” i wasnt in talking terms with my roommate at the time.
(3) there was no reason for me to stay. My uni closed gates until further notice and establishments was closed until quarantine restriction eased.
(4) some shit (my brother) will say stuff of how im having a “good life” and shit.
(5) my father had health issues recently.

I continued my second semester with online classes, and passed my classes because of smaller amount of requirements.

I enrolled for online school for my shortterm - was hoping to catch up by the next semester. I kinda did? Its been apparent that i was having trouble with my requirements and stuff. I am distracted easily. And family drama which i wasnt a part of for years is definately weighting in. I dont even know if most of the issues i was told was even true. Buti t got me thinking of it most days. The requirements was extended to december for submittion so it was something.

I was already thinking a year off for my third year, but i thought i could do it. So i enrolled my full course load. On the first month i got bombarded by requirements and i was overwhelmed. I also had a fight with my brother which did not really help either and i had heath issues too, fever and such so i thought i had COVID which also increased my stress level. So it wasnt the best start, i wasnt able to pass anything in the first month. Because paper documents was so hard to get to get a doctor’s appointment and such. Requirements have piled up and ive been having trouble focusing, most time i just watch some videos to relieve stress and some other time im just blank. So yeah 4 months have passed and no requirements passed. And im failing almost all my subjects. Also remember the subjects i took in short term that i forgot to submit? Yeah i didnt fulfill it. So im fucked. Even if i want to enroll this semester, i have no subjects to enroll except re enroll my previous subjects.

I think the biggest factor that lead me here:
(1) no where to buy stuff i need to do my requirements (im an architecture major). I tried using digital stuff to produce my requirements but its time consuming.
(2) family drama keeps coming up - rightnow theres a big fued between my brother and cousin, my mother is making it worse too. 
(3) i didnt get into my friends’ classes so i wasnt having any help since we have different instructors with different requirements.
(4) technical isuues (laptop bugging, internet provider issues, etc)
(5) i dont really know how to balance/ cope up with these issues.

Ive only pulled my shit together this december, and start my requirements, i have 5 days left, and im only about to finish 3 of my 9 subjects. Ive come up with a “good enough” system on how i do stuff. 

Oh also my parents doesnt know about it yet. Im thinking of holding a family meeting (fist it will ever be, my family doesnt have the best communication) telling them all my issues and suggesting a year off or until physical school returns. Hopefully it will go well. Ill update whatever happens.

Do you agree that i should take a year off or should i keep trying?

 Basically I went to community college when I was 18 and graduated a couple years ago, then started at a University. I took a break from school in the spring when covid was just getting started, but I wanted to get back to classes online last fall. Since it was online, I decided to take class from the community college instead of my university to save money. The class I needed wasn't available in the fall, but they suggested I take a couple non-degree courses that offered certifications in a similar field as mine because they can look really good on a resume. I know this is probably something you might think is a bad idea but I looked into it and went ahead and signed up anyway, I thought it would be good practice for me and keep me motivated instead of taking a full year away from school. The courses were TestOut Ethical Hacking and Network Security if anyone was wondering (which I do not recommend unless required). 

Once I started the course, I realized it was really hard to use, the videos would constantly freeze up and made it take over twice as long to get the work done. The labs would also mess up a lot and function poorly. I realized that the certifications they offered were not the main ethical hacking certifications (which costs over $1,000 to even take the test for), but they were just ""certifications"" from TestOut that basically said you completed the course. That is the equivalent of applying for a job as a truck driver and listing your driving school certificate from when you were 15 on your resume. I felt scammed and decided to drop the courses because I work full time and decided it was a waste to get these pointless certifications, but when I went to go drop them I was 2 days late past the drop date. 

I e-mailed my instructor, I talked to admissions, I tried to get removed from the school entirely, but there was no way to remove me at that point. I ended up failing BOTH classes, that I didn't even need for my degree, at a school I graduated from 2 years ago, and it made my GPA drop to hell. So my question is, for transferring to another University, is there anything I can do to NOT include these classes in the transcript?? I definitely did not need them for my degree which is why I'm kicking myself so hard. 

TL;DR, I failed 2 classes that I didn't need and fucked my GPA up. Is there any way I can not have it show up on a transcript?

I’m a sophomore although due to credits I’m technically starting my junior year in the spring. I am a political science and history double major. The classes are hard and can be dry but it’s a slog to get through every semester. The worst part is I’m gonna graduate kinda soon and I have no experience. Zip zilch zero. 

I’ve tried to work with several professors but I always get turned down due to lack of experience. Ironic. The academic counseling at my school sucks every time I meet with someone it always ends with yeah sounds like you have a lot to sort out. I haven’t done any extracurriculars in college and I really feel like I haven’t learned any meaningful skills I also don’t want to switch majors because I’ll essentially have to restart college and can’t really afford any extra years. Just in my current major I see no light at the end of the tunnel I’m just slogging through courses that offer me no skills and when I graduate will have no real direction to go. I’m just so frustrated that I screwed my self so badly. 

On top of that I’m also super burnt out every class for next semester just seems so boring and long and I just can’t take it. I’m doing online again because truthfully my social life sucked on campus.

I have a passion for creating and making things, and i want to live a career where i can pursue creative projects on my own time (ex: writing a book in spring, starting an art shop, freelancing by assisting in a collective film project, etc). 

Now here's the BUT you guys were waiting for.

My parents aren't exactly for that. I'm not upset at them for why, as I understand their point of view. As immigrant parents who studied very hard to get the jobs they have today, success to them is having a stable high financially rewarding career, so of course, they would like me to pursue something in STEM.

I have no problem with STEM, I'm in fact taking computer science classes as of now in high school, but its just not really worth the high check to live a  lifestyle with a predictable schedule and doing something that isn't satisfying nor is it what i really want. My parents see that my creative abilities surpass more than most other traits in me, but i tried mentioning to them once about perhaps getting  a high school endorsement in art and video communications (basically graphic design) and they completely shut me off. They lead it on to saying how being in it would convince me to go to art school, and also explained to me how one of their family friends' children pursued a degree in fine arts and are now 25 and still living with their parents in Florida, and couldn't fathom seeing me in that spot.  But they're still letting me take art classes on the side of the cs ones so thats good. 

I chose to take cs classes not only because it was a STEM class, but because i thought that maybe if i took cs and had a good understanding of art i could potentially be hired as an animator or artist for video game design, which i now realize isn't what I'd really want, because its still essentially art, but I have tight deadlines, and i heard there's quite the competition for video game artists, and its not worth the stress for the lifestyle or the pay.

I'm now thinking about perhaps taking business classes and maybe pursuing an mba or something alongside marketing, hopefully digital marketing, so that with a passion for artistic things and a good understanding of how to market them, I can hopefully build a decent career path for myself. Although going to art school would be good to improve, and can also help me network with other artists with similar passions, i dont think I would learn the business side of things in art school

By reading this, you'd probably think, well duh pursue that mba. I want to, but I'm wondering if business school, or specifically studying marketing in college, is worth it, or if i can develop those skills on my own. Also, right after college i would still need to work here and there for an employer to earn a decent amount to fuel these creative projects, so i dont know if getting a degree in business/marketing would be as reliable as a stem, such as cs.",college,Im a very creative person but dont know if i should go for cs or business,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/kny5kp/im_a_very_creative_person_but_dont_know_if_i/,1609467022.0

I realized that returning to my current university for the long term was not an option because it was way too expensive for me, so I have to transfer. 

I applied to 3 colleges, all public schools, and I can get in-state tuition for each of them.

295,Charming-Patience-22,1608526749,/r/college/comments/khaigo/should_i_transfer_for_my_junior_year/,"The past three semesters have been getting progressively worse. I had good grades my first semester and though it wasn’t the perfect gpa, I figured it was good for what I had been through that semester. It was a total emotional rollercoaster for me due to many hard life events and a worsening mental health. The only real friends I had were my roommate and a girl who had a dorm next to mine (well after my ex broke up with me which cut ties with my high school friends). 

Then the pandemic started for the second semester and of course we went remote which didn’t help anything. Again, my mental was worsening; I felt so alone and I only had two friends that every once and a while would text and check on me, and I just didn’t feel close enough to talk to them about what I was feeling. Since classes were remote, it was getting to the point where I was skipping classes because I just felt so tired which led me to a little bit of a more stressful point in my grades. I thought I was going to get kicked out of the honors college program I was in which I worked so hard to get into my high school years. 

Summer seemed like a good break to me. I took an easy class for a gpa booster. It was honestly a crappy summer. I didn’t do much. I didn’t have anyone to hang out with like once a week and I was basically in a dark room eating hummus everyday. I was texting one of the friends from the spring every once and a while about how it’s going to be a new and fresh semester so I was excited and I put the first two semesters behind me. 

The fall started and I was constantly in a state of stress (mind you, I’m a chemistry major I was taking organic chemistry, analytical chemistry, physics electricity and magnetism and math of bio) and ya again, my mental health fluctuated so bad. I was procrastinating all of my assignments. I’d give up on lectures. I tried so hard to make a cohesive study group, but it took almost halfway through the semester to finally have a consistent one. And I still felt lonely. Because of Covid, I didn’t have a roommate in my dorm. It was so hard to even try to join a club or make new friends because of social distancing. I had one friend and he was actually my best friend this semester. Our personalities crash in a lot of ways, school- and social- wise, but when they do intertwine we have the best time. I’ve been fighting with myself for the past two months about whether or not I should get off my meds because I’m paranoid I’m not smart anymore and I’m shit at school because of my meds or if this is truly who I am. If it weren’t for Covid, my gpa would’ve gotten me immediately kicked out of the honors college, but now I have pass or fail on my report card for all four of my classes. 

I don’t know what to do. I grew up moving around to new states every three years (military child) so maybe it’s just normal for me to have a big change of scenery every few years. So maybe that’s why I want to transfer. I currently live 10 minutes away from my parents’ house, which before I college I had lived in for five years. I have nothing else in my hometown except my volunteer job which promoted me to a salary job, a place I actually really love to work. 

I live in PA and have discounts on my tuition because of in-state and bc one of my parents work at the university. My idea is to go to a small school in Boston. I’ve loved the city since I lived near there before. My university now is huge. I feel like I need a smaller school. I’d have to pay more tuition. I could even play sports at the new school (I LOVED playing volleyball in high school). 

So should I transfer for the Fall 2021 semester?

296,ea0995,1607995762,/r/college/comments/kdbo8f/things_for_high_school_seniors_to_consider/,"Hi All,  
I am now 2 years removed from graduating college and I just wanted to let any 17-18 year olds looking for colleges things to consider  that I wish I could've thought about when I was your age. 

1.) Don't take out loans for the college experience / its okay to go close to home - 

Im not saying loans are bad. You should take out the loans you need for school, I emphasize 'for school'. I lived about 15 minutes away from a really good college with a highly recognized Engineering school, instead I went to an out of state school about an hour away that is just as recognized in Engineering as the in-state school. I enjoyed my time at the out of state school, but I ended up with about 30k in loans (which isnt that bad) while friends I had in the in-state school escaped with about 15k in loans. I would've probably gotten the same job at the same pay regardless of either school I would've gone to, so I could've saved 15k.  Most of the loans were just to live on campus and get the college experience because I didn't want to be so close to home. Trust me, a social life is not worth the loans if you can get a similar social life elsewhere for the same education. If you have a chance to go to Harvard for example, or your local state school, then that's different. Really assess your options if that is the case and see what's best for you. 

2.) Take out a credit card - 

You should ask your parents about building credit now. Have them take out a credit card in your name and let them use it for gas and pay it off every month. Or have them add you as an alternate user to a credit card they rarely use. That is if you think your parents will be responsible enough, there are also horror stories of parents messing up their kids credit. If not then take it out on your own but only use it once a month and spend like 50 bucks and pay it off by the end of the month. Your student loans will give you credit history but if you plan to pay those off quickly then it gets erased from your credit score once its paid off. Im not 100% sure but I think your credit score could go down for paying off your oldest account (its stupid, but that is the way it works). If you have a credit card as old as your oldest student loan, then your credit score won't be affected as much because your credit history is based off your oldest active account. My oldest accounts are my student loans and I didn't get another account till I graduated. So if I pay off my student loans early my history will drop 4 years. Even if you don't use the credit card you should never let credit cards close, because the more money you have in credit cards (the max amount in the credit card) and the less you use the higher your score gets. It's always good to use less than 10% of the credit card, keep it below 5% just in case.

&amp;#x200B;

3.) apply to scholarships even throughout your years in college -   
Scholarships are still given out even if you have been in college for years. Don't stop applying just because you are already in college. Colleges tend to have programs where alumni donate a certain amount to be used as a scholarship. There are scholarships for people online. If you can avoid getting more loans, you should do it. 

4.) you can start at a community college -  
community college doesnt get the credit it deserves. My parents/uncles/aunts saw it as an embarrasment to have me or my cousins go to a community college. If you want to save money and you think you can still graduate in 4 years assuming you get good grades, then go for community college for you first year to get general eds out the way. Check if there is a community college that works closely with a state university to transfer credits easily, usually if you get good grades you can get all your credits transferred if the CC and university have a good transfer program. If you only got accepted to one school but the school is too expensive or they are not giving you enough financial aid, go to community college for a semester or two, get your grades up and you can transfer to a 4 year school even if they rejected you in high school. It's easier to transfer to a school if you have good grades than it is to apply out of college. I get it's not the easy way out but it can save you a ton of money.

5.) College isn't for everyone / there are other options -  
this is for kids who may be in school because of their parents and may not like being in school. This does not apply to me but I do have relatives who went to school only because their parents slammed it into their heads and they didn't dare to tell their parents they didn't want to go. I also knew a few kids who went for the same reason and ended up dropping out. The relatives who didn't want to go stayed for at most a year and have student loans that they never wanted. Trade school (plumbing, electricity, etc) gets disrespected nowadays because nobody wants their kid to be a plumber. Even though you may have to work harder to make good money, there will always be a need for plumbing and other trades. There's no shame in it if you really work hard. You can even get in to real estate or maybe if you're really street smart and dedicated you can work hard at investing in stocks or real estate. It may take years and alot of luck for you to get good money in houses/stocks but it's been done before. Assuming you put in the necessary work. It's not easy and will take alot of learning and failing and you may never get good money but at least you tried. I wish me and my relatives knew of these different options, I would probably had still gone to school still but maybe my relatives would have gotten a good certificate and gotten better jobs. We were basically told its school or working at a factory. You can also sign up for the military if you like it and decide to go to school after your contract is up, which they pay.",college,Things for high school seniors to consider.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/kdbo8f/things_for_high_school_seniors_to_consider/,1608013762.0

I’m terrified for college and with admissions. It’s consuming all my thoughts and has made me toxic. I’m judging myself so harshly and I don’t feel as though I’m intelligent. Honestly, I’m not elitist. I don’t want to be. I’m even pursuing a path that’ll help the less fortunate. However, going to a community college or a safety seems like a fate worse than death. I feel so lost. I think I’m smart but I have adhd. It’s really difficult for me to do my homework or any work outside of class besides group projects. I procrastinate and have tons of missing assignments. I’ve tried to get medication to take after school but my parents are being really difficult. I can’t help but look back and hate myself for all the time I wasted procrastinating and that I didn’t get medication. I wish I tried harder. I didn’t know I needed a all a’s for top schools. Everyone told me that as long as my gpa was above a 4.0 weighted, I could go anywhere. I can’t. My unweighted is a 3.4. Weighted is a 4.07. I wish I actually knew about college admissions before this year. I’ve been trying to work harder to compensate for being years behind others. I haven’t been sleeping. I think that’s normal. I want it to be. Well, I think I do. I want a school with a stress culture. You know, where not sleeping and being in a million extracurriculars is normalized. I feel as though it’d help compensate for all the time I wasted in high school and the low pressure environment. 

I took 8 AP classes and 11 accelerated ones. My counselor told me not to take on such a heavy course load. I thought dropping a class was the worst thing ever. I wanted classes that challenged me. I was always at the same level as others. I got As on my tests but Bs in the end because of assignments. I didn’t care about the grade though. I just wanted to learn and have fun. I thought I was smart until I got a 1480 on my sat. I know that sounds ridiculous. I was disappointed that it was below a 1500. I don’t want to have such toxic standards for myself. I know they’re insane. My score is above the average for the places I’m applying to. I just feel inadequate. I don’t have these standards for others.

Literally no one is pressuring me to go to an elite college. I’m thankful for that but also slightly jealous. I know it’s delusional. I can’t help but wonder if I’d be better off if my parents expected me to attend a prestigious school? If that were the case, I would have known that grades are super important. I know that prestige doesn’t mean success. It feels that way though. The schools with the best programs for my major are prestigious. I didn’t choose that. I wish it wasn’t like that. I can’t get into my top schools. Georgetown and UMich. I’m scared because I have a kinda niche major. I’m also going into research so I obviously want places with amazing undergraduate research and study abroad programs. 

I can try and transfer after a year at my state flagship(T50) or maybe an overpriced private school that happens to accept me. I mean the first year courses for my intended major at georgetown are just generic math and science courses. Would it be worth it? I can’t find a lot of good global health programs and I’m in love with schools I can’t get into. 

Maybe it’s because of the area I live in. I felt as though I could get into great schools without working hard because I’ve seen some kids do that. I’m not talking about T20s, but my state flagship is a T50 and I’ve seen kids fail multiple classes and get in. I’ve also seen incredibly intelligent people attend too though. It doesn’t have a great program fir my major tbh though. It’s incredible for other subjects though. I guess I’ve viewed T50 as a baseline because of this. I guess I thought T50s were for average people and that I should go to something higher. I mean I saw people get in that didn’t care about school at all... I don’t think I’m better than most people; my work ethic certainly isn’t. I don’t think I’m nearly as accomplished as some of the people attending my state flagship. Its just that their average act scores are like a 27 or something. My scores are above the averages of my reaches, but those averages aren’t that low and are similar to my score. I have a really messed up view of standardized testing though. I want to fix that. I just have it in my head that everyone has a 1550 and that I won’t be successful.

I know I’m crazy but idk how to stop with these unrealistic standards. Maybe I should get off college confidential. I’m being so negative wow. I’m honestly usually the most outgoing and positive person. Anyways, I was always viewed as the smart slacker. I couldn’t fix being a slacker though. I tried. In middle school, I had so many missing assignments and I tried to hypnotize myself to do my homework. I literally couldn’t start it. I should have known that was a red flag. For the past 4 years, adhd was a tightly held secret. I was terrified of people finding out because I thought they’d doubt my intelligence. I had to email someone before every standardized test so I wouldn’t be put in the extra time room and never used my extra time for tests or extended homework deadlines. I shouldn’t have been so averse to accommodations but I felt as though my parents would use it to undermine my success and because of pride. 

Overall, I thought ADHD meant I was unintelligent because of the way it was discussed during my childhood and how my parents ridiculed me for it so I wanted to make sure no one knew I had it and that all my accomplishments were “genuine”. I honestly have no clue how to do schoolwork. I’m smart and can work hard in sports and I always participate in class discussions. I just can’t make myself do homework when I’m alone. I want to succeed in college and not make the same mistakes. I’m working on convincing my parents to let me see a psychiatrist that is not shady and I think I can start doing something to help my adhd before college starts. 

I’m just scared it’s too late to have into a “good” school. I feel like I’m so behind and that I should’ve published research already despite what anyone says. I know it’s not to late to have a good career but it feels that way. It feels like I missed my shot. I don’t know if I should mention my adhd on applications.. would it help? I’m at the point where I’m willing to work 24/7 so I can transfer to georgetown as a sophomore. I’m scared of my own standards. I’ve been so relaxed with grades and everything, so optimistic throughout high school. I think I’m becoming overly obsessed to compensate. 

I don’t even want “prestige” in that sense. I want to go to the schools with the best programs for my major; I’d choose the less “prestigious” school depending on the strength of the program. I’m just worried about the opportunities at targets and saftey schools. I’ve taken a class at a cc and loved it so I know that you don’t need to attend a fancy school for classes. Cc is such a smart move and I respect people who chose it. I’m just interested in research and international opportunities and that’s why I want to go somewhere with groundbreaking research. I know I can’t get into T30s but I love umich and Georgetown and would do anything to get in. I want to transfer if I don’t get in but I also want to give other schools a chance. My 3rd choice is a target and I think that’s be a good option instead of my 5th and 6th choices which are reached because strength of the program matters more than prestige obviously. 

I honestly don’t know what to do. Is there a chance to get into T30s or T50s(with a good program obvi)? Would colleges understand if I write about my adhd? It seriously makes it really difficult for me but I don’t want to just make excuses for bad grades. Would it be possible to transfer after a year? How do I become less toxic? I don’t like this version of myself. I just want to be carefree but also have more accomplishments. I have decent extracurriculars but I have had any research published or any fancy leadership titles. Does anyone have adhd tips for until I can get medicine for after school? 

I just feel so behind. I was once “smart.” I was fun and carefree too and wasn’t stressed and didn’t feel so inadequate. I didn’t care enough then and care too much now. I’m terrified.

Some people are apparently upset by this. I get how difficult things are and just wanted to put a disclaimer that my point was to uplift people. I’ve been a horrible student my entire life I have dyscalculia, severe anxiety, have panic attacks every night that keep me awake, loads of trauma, tried to unalive myself many times, and suffer from EDs etc so please hear me out when I say I get it. My circumstances changed considerably this year because I moved in with my SO who feeds loves and cares for me. I am very lucky in this way but it’s the first time it has happened. I have destroyed my credit and allowed myself to be in deep poverty in order to allow myself to do better in school. I have severe OCD surrounding money so this is very difficult for me. In addition to this, I am suffering from a new illness on top of other chronic illnesses. I get not everyone has the opportunity to move in with an SO. If I have to leave then I am literally homeless. But I’m also the first of my siblings of which I have three to be this close to their degree so yes I’m proud. My mom never finished college nor did my grandmother or my aunt or my older brothers who both dropped out. My sister is on a hiatus from school right now as well. I do get the frustration but I also wanted to describe my happiness because no one gets where I’m coming from and most people around me it comes naturally to get good grades. I’m the outlier of everyone around me. I hardly graduated HS and had a 2.2 GPA. I was terribly abused by roommates and my ex gf in college, had a roommate bring her abusive husband around make me terrified to even be there nearly got evicted numerous times, had my first roommate cause me to become suicidal and everything else and she caused my parents to nearly foreclose on their first home (that they had just bought months prior to this in their fifties. The girls mom then continued to treat us horrifically when we took care of her daughter while she was in the hospital etc after a suicide attempt). I lived in my grandparents three bedroom condo with 8 people because my whole family had to move in with my grandparents. I had severe depression in Hs and anxiety. 

Last year I tried to Off myself because my ex drug me through his addictions lying and cheating and I ruined my collegiate career because of it. I sacrificed jobs relationships and my own sanity and happiness for him. I resorted to sex work for the last four years. I only quit this year. And I am also dealing from the consequences of that on my social life personal life and mental state. I also went to jail because my brother beat me and cops don’t really give a shit about women who are abused. I took many semesters off or took very minimal classes because I paid out of pocket from SW. I’m only saying this because while I get it’s hard I don’t get why I should censor myself for being happy. I think I deserve to be happy about something going right in my life for once. There’s a million other issues in my life I could go on about but I won’t but I did work my ass off and I deserve to be happy with things going well for once after a shitty year.

305,GennaroIsGod,1606687633,/r/college/comments/k3igaa/please_dont_go_to_university_if_you_cant_afford_it/,"**FIRST OFF:** This is not a post telling people to not go to universities, please read the post. This post isn't geared at someone who's got the full ride to their dream college, so if thats you, this post likely isn't very relevant. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I know now a day there is a stigma that going straight to university after college is the right thing to do if you want to be successful and get a good job, and I want to say that its simply not true at all.** 

&amp;#x200B;

4 years ago I was in a position like many of you are right now finishing high school and not having a lot of guidance or idea of what I really wanted or what I really needed other than the fact my mother told me ""You can go to college and live at home, or you can not go to college and get kicked out, it's up to you."" 

&amp;#x200B;

That said I was no more than a 2.7GPA in high school and a 2.99GPA finishing off college so I am by no means a top of my class student in any realm, in fact I think that puts me basically at the bottom, basically a C average student at best, even though I felt I really tried (attending multiple hours of after school tutoring sessions, etc.. nothing really clicked), I scored an 18 on my ACT (well below the a good score) and was told to basically stay away from anything STEM related. So I can say with confidence that there are people in a lot better situations (and those in less than or equal to as well) in terms of finances, scholarships, and college advice, and I want to hopefully even help just ONE person with this post. 

&amp;#x200B;

This post isn't geared at someone who's got the full ride to their dream college, its geared towards someone who doesn't know what they want to do with their life, or even someone who just cannot outright afford university whether it be because their family isn't contributing or they don't get any financial aid, or they don't have any scholarships in general. **These are all very real scenarios that the majority of people run into all the time, and it can be crippling to your future if not handled correctly.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to provide some resources and advise for anyone who is considering taking college loans out SHOULD at least consider and review. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- People who still have have 1+ years of high school**

**PLEASE** consider dual enrollment classes, a lot of high schools are offering them now a day, I was able to graduate high school with 47 college credits by simply doing college courses over high school courses (and believe it or not I found them much easier to do, I attended a free ""college prep"" ""private"" high school) and found my classes extremely challenging, so instead I started taking most of my classes at community college through my high school for literally 10$/credit. I realize not all high schools have this option, but if you do, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE take advantage of it. This is an easy and cheap way to get general electives out of the way for college, and finishing high school at the same time, and it quite literally made high school easier for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- People who don't know what they want to major in**

This happens ALL THE TIME, people have no idea what they want to do, so they just attend a university as undeclared or as some random major that they end up switching 5 times in two years, if this is you, GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE, because all you're going to be doing is general electives and classes at your full university for 5x the price. You can do all of this, at community college, probably live at home, work a part time job, and really think about what you want to do before making any major decisions. It truly makes sense. 

(**THE ABOVE ADVICE WORKS THE SAME WAY FOR PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO MAJOR IN, YOU'RE JUST GOING TO BE DOING GENERAL ELECTIVES FOR THE MOST PART OF YOUR FIRST TWO YEARS OF UNIVERSITY, JUST DO THEM AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE)**

&amp;#x200B;

**- DON'T FEEL PRESSURED INTO GOING TO UNIVERSITY**

I have seen this so many times people feel absolutely left out that all their friends are leaving for some university, and they don't want to be the odd man out who doesn't end up going.  DON'T let your emotions get the best of you, this isn't about your friends, or your high school reputation (that no one cares about) this is about you and your financial future, don't get confused why you're going to college. 

Don't get yourself in debt for the sake of feelings, don't worry about anyone else but yourself. Odds are you're not going to know anyone that you went to high school with 3 months after you start college. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- Don't go to community college or university: TRADE SCHOOL**

For some people they feel as though they have no other option, this is simply untrue, trade schools exist for a reason, they're cheap and teach you a skill that can be used in the real world. I was on the fence on going to college simply because I absolutely did NOT like school, and my grades really showed that, but I did have a passion for the subject that I wanted to learn so I decided i'd like it better than the other options for trade school. But trade schools are by no means a bad thing at all. They exist for a reason. If you're going to go to college and get a learn a bunch of stuff that you don't like, you might as well just go learn a trade that you don't like for a fraction of the price and end up without crippling debt and a job! 

&amp;#x200B;

**- RESEARCH YOUR JOB PROSPECTS**

While college and higher education is there to continue your studies on a defined topic of your choice, if you're going into it with no money you MUST look at your job prospects, though I hate to say that you shouldn't go to college with the sole purpose of getting a fancy job, you should at least consider the opportunities you have after college in your field once you finish college. 

Unfortunately we're at a place where we have to treat college as an investment rather than a place to go learn regardless of the outcome, if you have all the money in the world and want to go study some weird obscure topic that has zero job possibility, thats totally fine. But this post is geared towards those who must treat college as an investment and NOT a luxury. 

High education will always be there, you can always go back, but you can't ever undo your college debt once you've signed for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- DO. THE. MATH.  LOOK AT ALL YOUR OPTIONS FOR YOUR UNIVERSITIES AND YOUR OPTIONS**

CONSIDER all your options in every university you can, look at all the data. Everyone wants to go to the school with the best program so they can get the best education, but the reality of the situation is,  its not at all feasible.  Unless you're getting financial aid and scholarships, its best just to choose the cheapest option, seriously. What you put into your education is what you'll get out of it.

We're at a time where we have everything available to us with a single google search. If you want to get the education of an MIT computer science student, you can do that, most of their lectures are posted on YouTube for FREE. THATS A FREE MIT EDUCATION, apply that with your normal classes at your University and you'll be a rockstar. Most companies want COMPETENT employees not fancy degrees. If you can prove your competencies and expertise on a subject in a job interview while someone with a harvard law degree cannot, they'll choose you any day of the week.  

&amp;#x200B;

**- REMEMBER WHY YOU'RE GOING TO COLLEGE**

SO MANY COLLEGES offer all these fancy dorms, gyms, campus coffee bars, etc. It looks awesome, living the american dream! But YOU WILL PAY FOR IT. That stuff doesn't come cheap and schools pass that cost right down to you. Don't fall victim to it, go to school for your education, not the fancy features that they give you. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 As someone who finished school with $20,000 in student loans, there are people who come out with 10x that who will never pay it off, people who will live pay check to pay check for the rest of their lives, don't do that to yourself. 

Be smart, be objective, do your own research. Don't feel pressured, don't be persuaded, do whats best for YOU. 

I know its hard when you're young and you don't think it'll be that big of a deal, and you'll be able to handle it. Even if that is the case, don't put yourself through that stress, its seriously unhealthy. 

No ones going to spoon feed you this information if they haven't already. You have to be ready to make your own decisions that'll affect you for the rest of your life. Do the research that it requires.

306,anonbutterflyrocks,1606328428,/r/college/comments/k0xkv8/how_i_won_an_academic_violation_case_and_how_you/,"**If you want to read the story that began this, I made this post in October:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jcuhw7/professor\_said\_i\_hacked\_into\_his\_computer\_to\_get/](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jcuhw7/professor_said_i_hacked_into_his_computer_to_get/)

Hey everyone. I come bearing good news. I ended up winning an academic dishonesty case against my professor, who claimed that I cheated on an Zoom administered exam because I answered a single question with an something that he didn't teach in class. He claimed I searched up my answer because he saw something similar online. This all started in October, when my professor held a meeting with me and tried getting me to confess to something I did not do: cheat. He then proceeded to report me to the college even after I explained my side of things to him and told him numerous times I didn't cheat and that he's making a mistake.

For all of October and most of November, I was utterly depressed. All of my hair fell out and I lost like 10 pounds, for real. Waking up every day felt horrible. I felt like I had a huge weight on my chest and I wouldn't be able to get it off, ever. I couldn't focus on anything this semester, friends, family, even my other classes. I couldn't even leave my room and talk to my parents, and whenever I did, I would cry because I wished something like this would've happened to me in high school or something, not college, because they would've been able to defend me. But in college, you're pretty much all alone. Parents can't do much but show you sympathy and reassure you. What will be the outcome? What will happen to me? Will I get kicked out of college? These would be the only things I would think about 24/7.

I'm a pre-med student and a cheating accusation could derail my entire track to medical school, my lifelong dream. I thought my life was over. Yeah, I know this sounds dramatic, but it really isn't dramatic when you're living through it. On top of that, I go to a really prestigious and expensive college in NYC, I felt like all of the money my parents worked so hard to save up and spent on tuition for me would've gone to waste if I didn't win this thing. Premed student or not, just being accused of something you didn't do while being completely innocent can ruin you, especially in college, where you're just starting to experience adulthood and independence, stuff like that.

After the professor pursued his case against me, I still didn't back down. I challenged his accusation and wrote out my appeal letter and sent it to the dean. I kept on going to his lectures, taking every single exam and submitting every single assignment and homework. I didn't miss ANY of that, and that's extremely important to do when you're faced with a false accusation like this. My professor stopped grading my work, though, and admitted he couldn't grade me fairly anymore because I was disputing his allegations. I reached out to everyone I could, the deans, my advisors, the department chair, to inform them of this. I was being treated like I was guilty by this professor, even while my case was pending.

After torturous weeks and weeks of waiting, I found out from my college's dean a few days ago that the case against me was dropped completely because my professor's claims were unreliable and his insufficient ""evidence"", which was an assumption, didn't make any sense. I had an incredible support system behind me throughout all of this, and I'm so glad my name was cleared. Just because of a stupid, careless mistake on my professor's side, my entire college career could have been ruined.

**So if you're falsely accused of an academic violation and you're innocent, DO THESE THINGS:**

1. During the initial meeting with your professor (if they offer one) to discuss the violation, make it clear that you didn't cheat, don't apologize for anything, explain your side clearly and calmly, and definitely communicate to the professor that you will be appealing the case if they decide to report you. **Don't let the professor take advantage of you,** because this is what happened to me. Had I defended myself properly, I wouldn't have been in this situation in the first place.
2. **APPEAL, APPEAL, APPEAL!** If the professor does end up reporting you, know that you have the right to appeal by your university. I'm pretty sure this applies to every single institution in the U.S, at least.
3. If you can afford an educational lawyer, definitely hire one. It's not necessary and they won't be able to directly defend your case, but it's nice to have someone who can help you write your appeal letters and come up with any evidence that you need to defend yourself.
4. Reach out to an academic advisor, the department head, the deans, whoever has some sort of power. Don't be embarrassed to inform them. The more people you have on your side from the beginning of the process, the better.
5. If there's an ombudsman/student representative in your university, TALK TO THEM. Set up a meeting and ask them to walk you through the process and what you have to do to protect yourself. They should even help you write your appeal letter. I didn't have an ombudsman at my college (weird, even though my college's law school is well known) but I had my advisor, class dean and the department chair on my side.
6. **Don't stop attending the classes** where you were accused of cheating in. Keep doing everything you would've normally done-- homework, tests, assignments, etc. Don't miss a single thing, seriously. If you do, it can make you look guilty, you'll look like you just gave up and don't care about your academics.
7. **Have patience.** Academic violation cases can unfortunately take a lot of time and you just have to wait to hear from the committee or whoever is going to review the case. Also, during the pandemic, there are a lot of academic integrity cases anyways because students are literally cheating left and right and getting caught red-handed, even over Zoom administered exams. However, there are other innocent students (like me) who didn't cheat and are being accused due to misunderstandings or just sheer negligence on the professor's side.
8. **Trust the process, and GET OFF REDDIT!!!** NO, your life isn't over. Breathe. Unfortunately I was an idiot and came to Reddit seeking help. I posted about my case (linked above) and desperately asked strangers for advice. Some people said that I'm not going to win the case and that my life is over. These comments really made me second-guess myself and my college. I thought that I would be convicted of something I didn't do, and that my college could indeed convict me of a false accusation. Turns out all of those negative comments are wrong.

Sorry for the long post but yeah, this is what happened. I could still sue my professor for defamation and mistreatment, but I don't think I will, because I don't care about him. It's really sad and unfair how some professors can get away with maltreatment and false accusations, ruining a student's life. But if you know didn't cheat, then don't worry, you will be fine. Remember to defend yourself and don't back down. If you did cheat and you got caught, sorry buddy, I don't know what to tell you. Actual cheaters deserve the consequences and that's all I'll say.

I hope this post was helpful. All hope is not lost. If you're convicted of something like this and you need someone to talk to or you need advice, I'd be more than happy to help you and share some of my wise wisdom haha.

**TLDR;** I was falsely accused of cheating by my neurotic professor who pursued an academic violation case against me to my college and I won the case.

I'm currently a senior in college. My GPA is 3.94 and I have research experience under my belt. However, I have a lot of W grades on my transcript and my attendance from semester to semester has been inconsistent. This is due to my struggle with my mental health, specifically depression and anorexia.

I was already struggling before I started college and it just got worse from there. I made it through my freshman year with A's and only one B, though I don't know how I managed to make it through spring semester because I was actively starving myself and sometimes suicidal.

I crashed during sophomore year. My anorexia and depression got so bad that I could not function and made an attempt at my life. I was forced into treatment so I had to withdraw from all 6 of my classes. I missed spring semester of my sophomore year because I was still in treatment. Thankfully, I was able to salvage 2 of the 6 classes because my professors were gracious enough to let me complete the work I had missed.

I made it through fall semester of my junior year with all A's and a place in an honors research program. Unfortunately, my mental health went down the drain again over winter break. I then underwent the worst depression I have ever experienced and relapsed into my anorexia as well. I tried so hard to stay afloat, but I couldn't do it anymore and withdrew from all but 2 of my classes, including the research program (which I hold an immense amount of shame about). I finished the 2, thankfully, but was distraught at the amount of W's that were now on my record.

I ended up entering treatment again for my anorexia this summer and am still in it now. I managed to take 2 online classes this semester and am looking to pass with A's. I didn't plan much for the upcoming spring semester (my treatment team tried to convince me to take the semester off) and missed the deadline for online classes. I'm hoping that I can still get the approval and take at least 2 online courses again.

I'm very, very concerned at how bad my record looks. To me, it seems irredeemable and I'm wondering if there's any point in finishing. I want to go to grad school, but I fear that no place will accept me. I feel that I am incredibly weak and could have pushed myself harder to stay in school despite my struggles, because that is what a truly strong person would do. I'm giving up hope for myself.

309,Bluerasberrytree,1606189879,/r/college/comments/jzxka2/feel_like_im_screwing_up_college_through/,"Since I was a little kid, I’ve always loved everything relating to fossils, dinosaurs, extinct animals, and museums. Because of that, I’ve always felt a clear sense of direction in my life- wanting to work with that kind of thing. Anyways, I’m now finishing up with my 1st semester as a college junior. I’ve been working towards that goal, but it’s honestly feeling harder to attain for me now. A little background

I went to a weird little pseudo-montessori place for high school. This place had good humanities teaching, but STEM? Well, the health teacher was an open and proud antivaxxer if that tells you anything. Basically, I never encountered a science class in high school that wasn’t either easy enough or lenient enough to pass. I was considered one of the “smart kids” there, and graduated with a 93rd percentile ACT score. Yeah, I know- this stuff is always a prelude to bad things.

My Freshman year, I faceplanted hard as a result of not having the study skills needed for a STEM course, or the organization skills needed for any course. I finished my first semester that year with a 2.25 GPA, and I didn’t do much better the second. I was setting out to do either a Bio/English double major, or a bio major and English minor by this point, which is still where I’m at today.

My sophomore year, I started taking microbio classes that were required, like Cell Physiology. Those were really tough for me, because they required a lot of memorization, and I got Cs in them. So I tried to concentrate on the macrobio courses instead, stuff like Animal Behavior and Ornithology. I love those topics, and the profs that teach them at my school are awesome. The thing is, and here’s the crux of my problem- I keep getting “Bs” in those classes, no matter how hard I try. I always make little mistakes, or fuck something up on an organizational level. It’s like, I came into college without organizational skills, and it’s still fucking me over 2+ years later. For my recent Animal Behavior course, I know that over half the class got an A. I’m probably gonna finish the course with an 85-88%, which isn’t bad, but I could have done so much better. As I said, I love my profs, but I don’t know how to look them in the eye when I’m doing worse than a majority of the class.

What’s funny is that I do well in my English classes for the minor. I have a 99% in my current literature course, and I have pulled 3 other English A’s. I’ve only had 2 science A’s. My GPA for the current sem is gonna be 3.3 or 3.4. My overall GPA is 2.94, meaning that I can almost certainly get it up past 3.02 by senior year, which is apparently the average for bio majors upon graduating. But this lack of science A’s, which other people clearly are getting, is now getting to me. I want to be better, and have good relationships with my profs, but I feel like I’m running all out of time, with only 3 semesters left. So I guess I want to know what I should do? How screwed am I? What people should I be talking to?",college,Feel like I'm Screwing Up College Through Mediocrity,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jzxka2/feel_like_im_screwing_up_college_through/,1606207879.0

Lately I have been having wifi issues especially during the night. It becomes very laggy and extremely slow. Sometimes once it does load, not all of the content of the page appears. Any how, towards the end of writing my essay I noticed it started to lagged. I finished my essay at exactly 10:00p.m. All I had to do now is convert it into a word.docx. This where where shit hits the fan because I tried refreshing my page and it would not load. I tried everything from restarting my laptop and router to simply disconnecting my wifi on and off. Nothing. I texted my roomate to see if she was having the same problem and she was but solved it but connecting her phone's hotspot to her laptop. I thought that was brillant and wanted to figure out how to do the same. I emailed my professor 10:27pm to let her know that I was experiencing wifi issues and I having a hard time trying to turn in my paper. To keep it short after I emailed my teacher I wasted another 30mins of researching how to use hotspot on my phone until I found out my phone plan doesn't come with hotspot. At this point I was freaking out and I dashed to my roomates room asking if I could use her hotspot. Which I felt very bad about bc she too was trying to do school work but she agreed and thank you so much Lesile if your reading!! 

I got connected and I jumped in happiness and relieved but I was such a fool to do so because the connection was very slow to the point where to took almost 40mins to convert my essay to a word.docx and then trying to log in to canvas and into the submission page and OH MY GOODNESS it was 11:52 and I sweating bullets because my I was trying to submit my FREAKIN ESSAY AND IT WAS LAGGING!! I kept trying to refresh the page which was a hugee mistakee!! Basically it did not load in time. It was already 11:59p.m and it didn't accept my paper even tho it was in process of sumbitting since 11:52!!! I took a screenshot at 12:00p.m which was another huge mistake and I emailed my teacher once again that I couldn't submit my paper and sent her the screenshot along with my attached essay (to proof that I did it). 

The next morning I get an email from her sayin the reason why my paper didn't go through is because I sent it past 11:59p.m (hence the screenshot) and that according to her either way technical difficulties is not an excuse to turn in a paper late and that I had a week to do it. She also mentioned that she gives plenty of extra credit anyway. I was shock at her response because obviously this isn't the only class that I have (currently taking 5 in total)  and plus I have other obligations aside from school like work. Plus not to mention that were in a GLOBAL PANDEMIC. Im usually the type of student to go study in a library but even with my campus being open I can't afford to expose my self to covid since I don't have health insurance and obviously don't want to catch it!! Sorry at this point im ranting but just very curious to know what you guys think off all this. I have accepted her not grading it.

TLDR: was having wifi issues with the connectoin. Let my teacher know in advance in a email about an hour n half before it was due. Got to use myroomates hotspot but had extreme slow connection. Still couldn't get my paper to load and missed the deadline. Emailed my teacher again with my essay attached (to proof that I did it).

When I graduated high school I went straight into a pretty good state school (I’m 28 now, for a time frame), but I struggled hard. Looking back, my HS didn’t really do a lot of college prep, it was more of just pass the standardized tests, and this district was very rural. 

Anyway, I struggled hard my freshman year, and ended up on first suspension after the first semester of my sophomore year. School was a challenge but I was also working two jobs, family issues, and dealing with a shebang of untreated depression. Tried a bunch of majors, shadowed professionals, nothing really fit. I went back and was suspended again a second time after my 4th semester. I realized I had other things to deal with, took six years, and then last fall tried to go at it once more. I had a lot more thing under control- finances were the big one but I was still working. The long and short of it was I felt I wasn’t getting the help I needed. My school over admitted that semester, and I really feel like my need for help went unheard: some classes where twice the size they normally were, and tutoring sessions were booked as soon as they opened for the week. I also struggled being in a rural community so focused on the university, but I was so much older than my classmates it was hard to connect.  I was put on final suspension at the end of that semester. 

I’ve taken a year to evaluate where I want to go and what I truly want to do, got my depression controlled with pharmaceutical therapy even though I don’t have insurance, and I’m currently enrolled in community college. I’m in an advanced associate’s program that does condensed classes that start every 8 weeks- we just finished our first 8 week semester and I got all As.

I know that my parents expect a certain ""something"" from me and I do not want to let them down, but at the end of the day, I need to figure out what I want to do and do me. 

Option one: Take an Academic LOA (leave of absence).  I would work two jobs (i have one already and two other offers) and realistically make around 30,000-34,000 this coming year. I would be able to pay for my last two years and FAFSA would cover at least a year (I'm a very poor minority. They didn't pay this year because of some technical issue with my grades. My first year i did really bad, had to go to a jc and fix my grades, got a 3.75 average gpa for a year and was told that FAFSA would cover this year but because of COVID, no one in the financial aid dept. answers their emails or phones. I know makes no sense Ive tried to reach them for two months. Anyways, they will pay next year for two more years). During the year where I would slave away, I figure out my passion and see what I want to do with my life. I don't want to be on my death bed regretting my decisions and I want to be happy and do something I love and am passionate about. 

Option 2: Take out loans and/or borrow money from relatives. I really don't want to get in debt. I have outstanding credit for someone who is 20 and I want to keep it that way. I have some friends who offered to pay and I would just have to pay them back but I refuse. I am not that type of person. 

Option 3: Just straight up drop out. My parents would disown me (Like i mentioned before, I am miserable where I am at right now and I do not want to keep feeling this way, but this is something I'm considering). 

Option 4: Online gambling. I turned $100 into $1400 in about 2 weeks and I am not going to brag about this seeing that it is very risky business but its an option. 

I would love if you guys offered any other options or tried to see which one of these seems like the most reasonable. I am really stuck and I have exactly 6 days to decide what I am going to do. Looking at my life and the past 2-3 years, I see that I am really passionate about food and nutrition and real estate and/or buying businesses and renting them out (you have to have money for this one). I am a really good cook for having no prior knowledge and one of the job offers I have is to work at a high end butchery. As for the business and real estate side, I have a buddy who offered me a job to work with his dad, His dad has his own business but he deals with real estate and property management. 

In about 20/30 minutes I have to talk to my parents and decide what I want to do. I will obviously take their input as they have the experience and wisdom, but I do realize that I need to voice my opinions and wants and tell them what I think is best for me. What I end up choosing is going to affect my life and what I do is for my benefit....or downfall. 

I used to think that if you didn't go to college, you were a low life and you were going to get no where, but really you don't have to if you find something that you love. I really want to figure out what I want to do for the rest of my life because these online classes and engineering courses ain't cutting it. I don't want to disappoint my parents and family because I really would be crushing their hopes for me, but at the end of the day, I want to be happy. I want to do me and be me 100000% as opposed to living the life they want me to. I want to look back and have no regrets and have a family and kids and be a able to support them while doing the thing that I love. I know I need to figure that out but I really am done trying to fit in the expectations others have set for me. It's hard and we don't get praised enough for the shit we do or the things we accomplish. I really appreciate anyone who reads this and/or comments.

Throughout my time here, i've had basically no clue on what i wanted to do, so I was feeling the pressure to decide soon. I took some time to think and consult with my advisor and decided that computer science would be the best major for me. Honestly, computer science was the only thing i felt interested in at all, is one of the best degrees you can get, and gives me the highest chance of success which is a big reason why i decided on it. I know this doesn't fit the ""follow your passion"" advice people give, but i honestly don't believe my passion fits into providing my family and I a good living.

The problem is I'm just worried I won't be able to do it. I know it is one of the most strenuous degrees out there, involves a bunch of math, and has one of the highest drop out percentages in most schools. I've never been the best at math. I slacked all of middle and high school. In college, I straightened up and tried my best. I finished with a 98 in the remedial math course i had to take and a 99 in pre-cal. I'm just worried I might be believing in myself more than what is reasonable.

Are there any specific resources i can use to teach and prepare myself before i take the actual classes for comp sci? What should i be expecting and how hard will it be? Is there hope?

323,StarDingo,1602180005,/r/college/comments/j7hzxb/failing_a_graduate_statistics_class_and_the_whole/,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I am in a graduate school and taking a statistics class. Now, this class is a prerequisite for a class that I want to take in the future semesters, so there is no way around it. It's considered very hard, and my advisor warned me that it would be hard. In addition to being already quite complex, it's also very hectic. The professor claims that he wants the best for us, but as a person who graduated with a B.S. Degree in Engineering and went through his fare share of tough classes in different disciplines, I disagree with his methods. Instead of having us take a single midterm and a final, he opted for conducting a proctored quiz every single week up until the final to ""reduce the stress"".  Well, I am actually more stressed than if I had to take a single midterm. Now, every Thursday I have to take a nerve-wrecking 1 hour proctored quiz. You know, it would not be so bad if the quiz went other the stuff that was covered in the lectures and homework, but it's not the case here.

&amp;#x200B;

For the last quiz, the professor gave us two problems that involve a variation of the topic we had covered. I had never seen these two exact types of problems in the homework, in the lectures, or in the additional problem sets from his book. I studied for 2 days straight, just for that quiz, and I still did bad. I had never seen those exact types of problems. The professor claims that going through his lectures, the homework, and the additional problems would be enough to prepare for the quizzes, but it's a lie. Moreover, last time he said, direct quote: ""Well, you asked for this class, and this class is very hard, so I will give it to you."" Whatever that means. What's even more strange is that we consistently have at least a half of the class acing each test. I don't want to be a racist here and poke at people, but we have a lot of Indian and Chinese students in our class. In many US colleges, they are known for being very smart, but also for knowing where to search for the material from which the professors usually take the exam problems. It just feels like I am missing something here.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. The professor claims that he makes up new problems for each quiz, but I think it's a lie. He probably takes the problem sets from one of the reference books. I am not asking for a way to cheat here. I have tried putting in a lot of work and doing exactly what the professor told us to do, but it just does not work. Half of the class aces each quiz every single week, doesn't it sound suspicious to you? What advice can you give me?

In high school I was (and still am) a very extroverted person and I love talking with and getting to know people but I can be a bit shy at first depending on the situation and zoom makes it worse because I get anxious about these things. I’m doing classes online from home and academically I’m doing well but socially I literally have no college friends, I still only talk to my best friends from high school. Some of them stayed home for college too but I can’t hang out with any of them due to covid and I became friends w my roommate but we stopped talking since I stayed home and she went on campus. I’m in several group chats in my college and multiple clubs at college but since everything is over zoom I just feel so awkward and everything feels weird when it’s not in person. This is the incident that really annoyed me though:

I tried to make a small study group a few weeks ago for a test that was coming up and out of the 4-5 people I emailed only two bothered to respond, and when I emailed those two they ignored it and we never ended up meeting. It made me feel pretty shitty because I could have used the help, and I see those people in classes each week so it’s pretty weird that they never responded (some of them talked with me when we were in breakout rooms and acted like it never happened though). If this was real life I’d probably find a joking way to bring it up but since it’s all online and I don’t know any of them well, I can’t without sounding ridiculous. It’s even more awkward since I’m sure they all saw it since literally everything is online and in their school emails. I’ve had somewhat similar things happen where someone else at college will start messaging me to try to be friends and then randomly stop responding or not even open my message?? This never happened to me in high school and I just find it so bizarre and rude. I’m not an annoying person I literally just show up to class and leave so I don’t know why people are being so strange and cold. It’s upsetting because I already feel so alone and I’m stuck at home with my family to save money. I guess I could say I have a few acquaintances but not really anyone I feel comfortable reaching out to with questions and definitely not any friends.

Striaght As with 1 B.  The following year my mom remarried, moved out of state, and suddenly I had to work 30+ hours a week and manage my own household, roommates, etc.  I was homeless for a long stretch as well.

Right now I am struggling to take classes part time online while I work full time.  I wasn't even supposed to be full time, they just need me so often because of covid that I hit 40 hours every week.  I have to pay rent, I can't just leave, and I can't say no.  I'm three weeks behind on my classes and we're only a month into the course.  I have today and tomorrow off so I am going to be catching up and working at it, but right now I'm just plunking away at a degree that might not even fucking do anything for me and that I am no longer interested in due to burnout.

I tried taking a year off, and my first semester back I failed all my classes.  The next semester I took two classes and still failed one.  Then, I passed both my classes the semester after that.  I'm on semester 4 now and feel like I've made virtually no progress.  I have been in school for 4 years and still have not managed to earn a fucking 2 year degree.  It makes me beyond depressed.

This is so fucking hard for no real reason and I hate it.  I hate it *so much*.  I hate my shitty retail job and I want to do something in my arena of interest but it seems impossible at this point because this country is intent on grinding people without an inheritance into dust.  

I wish I could just check out of my life and put a little bookmark in and go to school full time.  Just live on campus like other people, and go full time, but I can't for a whole host of reasons (namely-- I can't even begin to afford the kind of debt that would incur.

This semester rolled around and I was stupidly convinced that classes would only be online for a few weeks. I thought I could push through, but online classes are not for me. I can't keep up with the work and am struggling staying focused during zoom meetings (I put my phone away, take notes, and try to actively participate, but retain nothing). I've tried to schedule an appointment with my advisor to get advice, but she is currently furloughed and unavailable.

I am currently having to fill out SAP appeals because of my previous time in college. I struggled very hard to get back into college due to my past. At this point, I haven't been able to keep up with online classes and am willing to push out graduation for as long as it takes for classes to return to in person. So, is it better that I keep trying as hard as I can and take a failing grade in my classes, or do I take the w? Which looks worse and which is easier to recover from?

Fast forward to two weeks later my roommate and I catch Covid and end up having severe symptoms (fever, horrible body aches, cold sweats and chills all night, migraine from hell, and loss of senses). My school makes you quarantine for ten days then you have to do an interview to determine if you’re ok to go back to campus. Well,  I missed my interview and ended up being out for two week because I couldn’t physically get out of bed but, the kicker is my professors don’t believe the younger generations can get severe symptoms and all my deadlines were concrete.

332,AndyTheHunn,1599582417,/r/college/comments/iowr0i/how_not_to_start_a_club/,"This is a reflection on things I did wrong when starting a new club sport. I really believed that this new team would take off and went to get advice from resources such as club sport captains, similar teams at other colleges, professors, and the general club sport advisor. A common suggestion on the topic is to make something you would want to be a part of, but it is clear to me now that members can want a variety of different things, some of which is easier to achieve than others. Throughout my tenure, I tried to incorporate one on one conversations to make sure I hear the ideas and interests of the less vocal members. I guess what I am trying to say is that I thought I had everything I needed to make this team a reality but in retrospect, I did not. My greatest fear now is that I had created an organization that is essentially defunct with no interest from the general student population and board members that is apathetic to the position. 

Coming off the success of a more informal student organization, the core members of the club were interested in competing more formally. These members had always liked the idea of being a club sport organization whenever it came up, so it felt very possible, especially since a neighboring college had a similar and successful program. Surveying my club, we had eight people that said they would formally join this team when it came together. It was not a wise choice to believed 8 people would join regardless of the structure and responsibilities of the team. Another red flag that should have been extra apparent to me was when I had to go invite my club mates to become board members of this new team. The current board was graduating, and I had to go personally ask for members to come on the board. I should have stopped here as obviously no members were volunteering to be on the board, and I had to persuade my members to take on board positions. This led to a lot of issues with commitment and collaboration which were no one’s fault than my own. I was blind to an obvious indicator of weak interest due to my belief that I can get these members committed if they could help shape rules and regulations on how the team would work. However, the wishes of these members were on opposite ends of the spectrum and their refusal to compromise was damaging. This goes into another aspect of having to pick the board members. I wanted the most passionate members of the sport as I thought this would translate to passion in forming a team. However, the strong-willed nature of the people I collected would ultimately fail to collaborate in every way. 

As I may have alluded to above, of the eight individuals that said they would join, only three would formally join. I went to work on trying to recruit more members by cultivating an inclusive community. We wanted anyone that were interested in learning more about the sport and had open practice sessions and social events. I pushed extra hard at the socialization aspect with team dinners and gatherings (pre-covid) to no avail. However, it seems like most new faces that displayed initial interest were more interested in getting guidance on the training aspect and were not at all interested in competing. On the other hand, we had interest from people that were actively competing but did not want to join the team. This issue befuddled me, especially since I knew I needed to focus our attention to one of these demographics instead of half-assing both. I still can’t determine if this was a bad choice, but I decided to accommodate the newcomers and try to recruit them to the team after they spent more time with the members and coach, compared to recruiting already established athletes, since newcomers were more numerous and were not opposed to the structure of the team. Now you might ask why some athletes were oppose the structure of the team and I also find this question hard to pinpoint. I did have a few individuals that would only join if we would fund them without them participating in fundraising or any other team event, which I felt was unfair for the other members. 

I went ahead trying to recruit students that are new and interested in the sport. I was able to get a few freshmen, but their involvement is solely with the coach and share little camaraderie with the older members of the team, regardless of my attempts to incorporate them. I also tried pushing for a tighter knit community by removing individuals that were not active in our group chats, but whether this was beneficial or detrimental is unknown to me. And of course, advertising the team by word of mouth or social media was ongoing, with word of mouth being more effective. The nail in the coffin was, however, the emergence of Covid-19, which derailed our national competition which was supposed to help establish us as a competitive group. To close out, I think my wishes for a more formal structure did not align with the expectations of the current or would/be members. I believe that due to the current members at my disposal and the school culture focused on professional development, the choice for club sport was ill advised. This is especially apparent when compared to the success of the club’s more informal predecessor. As they say, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. But I cannot blame all my short comings on circumstances as I was the one constant factor. Whatever the reasons, I think I learned some hard lessons on how to put together a team.",college,How Not to Start a Club,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/iowr0i/how_not_to_start_a_club/,1599600417.0

I'm a sophomore in mechanical engineering at a decent state school that is known for engineering. As much as high school I was convinced I was good at math and science it turns out I'm not and I dont even like it. Really I liked tutoring English classes and I connected to my English teachers. Now that I no longer have an english class or gen eds I'm swamped with six classes that are all calc and physics. 

Many mental break downs later I don't know if I should switch, what to, or keep my major and take one less class.

Pros of keeping:
- good paying job
- ability to get a job is high
-  could have more time 
- could retire sooner or switch

Cons of keeping:
- I'm always stressed and it's affecting my mental health and physically 
- I always feel dumb (it's hard getting help which I'll add to the bottom)
- later I don't want to teach math or science if I retired from engineering
- I don't like any of my classes

__________________________

Pros of leaving:
- mentally I'll feel better
- I could like the classes
- I could do better

Cons of leaving:
- if I want to go back to my major: I can't
- I would be behind in all other majors unless it's math or science
- this would take more than 4 years and would be a lot more money
- i dont know anyone else in other majors generally speaking
- less people to study with bc I don't know them and to give me books for free etc.
- English teacher for 8-12grade can be hard to get hired
- English teacher can get no salary, no time, etc
- if I don't teach I don't know what major to do

I don't know what to do. It's super hard reaching out for help because sometimes the Prof doesn't have office hours that can ever work, the tutors or the Prof doesn't speak English as their first language and the barrier can be so strong, I can ask friends but sometimes they don't have the time or don't want to help every step. I don't want to wait forever to get a job if I teach and I don't want to be unhappy with my job and major for all my life. College =/= real life but there can be aspects of college that follow me to my job. And three years to the rest of my life isn't a lot but that doesn't mean I should suffer for three years, right? I just need opinions

As for documentation I honestly do not have any, at the most I could probably get my therapist to write me a letter but I failed my fall semester and I started therapy in the spring so im not sure if a letter from her would make any difference. But please give honest feedback, and any advice is appreciated. Thank you so much! 

To Whom It May Concern:

My name is\_\_\_\_and I have been a student at University of Massachusetts Boston since Fall 2019. I am a Sociology major with a minor in Public Policy, I am writing this letter in great hopes of appealing my financial aid. I understand what has put me in this position and take full responsibility for everything that led up to it. As time has gone by, I have improved my mindset, and I am determined to be much more successful in my academics and my future. None of this is an excuse for not doing well academically but it is why I am in this position now. 

During Fall 2019 I had a positive mentality of starting fresh at this school and doing well. Not that far into the semester I got involved with someone who turned out to be very toxic and abusive. Soon after I started feeling extremely overwhelmed with school and my relationship and felt as if everything was getting out of control. I stopped going to my classes and I stopped speaking to many of my friends and family. I completely isolated myself and fell into a pit of depression. I was only doing the bare necessity of what I had to do and other then that I didn’t do anything. The abuse in the relationship was getting worse, it was more emotional but sometimes it would also include physical abuse which worsened my depression and led to drinking too much. Looking back, I wish I had told someone or had asked for help instead of making it seem like everything was okay, but I was too afraid to at that time. Right before starting Spring semester I finally had the courage to get out of that relationship and I cut off of all ties with that individual. Since then that person has not tried to get in touch with me and I have improved on myself. 

I made a promise to myself that I was going to be better, and that I was going to get through the Spring with passing grades. I started writing more to let my thoughts out of my head, my drinking problem had gotten better and I had the mindset of starting therapy at my University once I was used to my daily schedule. I faced obstacles during Spring semester that would have resulted in me failing again but this time I was able to pick myself back up and do well, I asked for help when I needed it, I worked with people from the Dean of Students office and I worked with people at the counseling center. I emailed back and forth with my professors, and I was able to pass my classes. The spring semester taught me a lot about how I learn and also what tools help me learn, I figured out how to manage my stress by meditating which allowed me to not panic. For example, when I saw I had a ten-page paper to write instead of feeling stressed or overwhelmed, I made a plan and broke the paper down to do it by sections every day. I have learned how to manage my course load, but also to understand and realize when I will not be to. I am not a bad student I have it in me to do well and if given the chance I will be able to prove that to you by continuing to use the tools and resources that are available to me this upcoming semester.

Receiving financial aid is extremely important to me because there is absolutely no way, I can pay for school out of pocket. I rely on the financial aid I get to pay most of my costs, and for the rest my parents and I take out a parent plus loan. I have two younger siblings and my parents already struggle providing them with everything they need, the last thing I would want is for them to be stressed over me. I also rely on financial aid to keep my job which is how I pay for my daily necessities. I work at the Dean of Students office on campus which is a work study position, if I don’t receive aid not only will I have no way to pay for school, but I will not even be able to pay for anything I need such as textbooks since I won’t have a job. I plan on attending law school after I finish undergrad, so financial aid is extremely important to me. My dream is to become a lawyer, it has been ever since I was in elementary school but my dream cannot be financially supported by my parents which is why I would be extremely grateful for another opportunity to show that I am worthy of receiving aid and that it will be put towards a good student with a bright future. I made many mistakes during the fall which I have learned from, I have changed completely as a person since the fall and I want to show that to this University. 

I have and continue planning on making many changes when it comes to my academics for this upcoming semester. The first thing I did was take the advice of my academic advisor and reduce my course load. Since the Fall 2020 semester is online which I feel might be somewhat more difficult than in person classes, I reduced my course load from five classes down to four so that I will not have an abundance of coursework that is unmanageable. I have also spaced out my classes by time and days, I only have one class on Wednesday, and Friday’s, and I have two classes on the remaining days which I will be able to manage. I have already built a small study schedule which just sets time blocks of how much time I will be spending working on one class. Once the semester starts, I will be setting reminders on my phone to alert me when class is going to start in fifteen minutes so that way, I have enough time to get all my materials and be at a place with no distractions where I can fully focus. During the spring semester I used an agenda book and also an app on my laptop called “myhomework” to keep track of my assignments and due dates which I will continue to use this upcoming semester because by using those materials, I noticed myself staying on track with everything, I noticed that if a due date was getting close, I could physically see it in my agenda, and I would also get an alert through my laptop. Along with that I plan on using the resources available to me through my University. If struggling with a paper, or some assignments, I plan on getting in touch with the tutoring and writing center so that someone there can assist me and help me do better. My job is also very flexible, and they put the student’s education first, so if I need to reduce my hours or even have some days off to fully focus on an assignment or class then I will do that. I am willing to make any change that I can in order to succeed. 

With all of that being said I am continuing therapy through UMass, I am open to mandatory advisor meetings, following academic plans, or any resource available that will guide me in completing my future semesters at UMass successfully. I want to be at this school, and I want to succeed at this school, I applied to this school four times before I finally got accepted on my fifth try. I am a fighter and I will work hard and fight hard to get to the place I want to be in. I am an extremely passionate student and I love to learn, and this is the school that I would love to continue my education in. I am not making any excuses or placing any blame for my academic failures because at the end of the day I am the one responsible for my education. I hope this letter shows how I have made positive changes for my academics and that I am serious and prepared for this upcoming semester. I have matured and grown as a student and as an individual and I am dedicated into making my time at this school count and be a positive experience. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my letter.

I found out about this when i was just 6 classes shy from my BS in marketing AFTER my semester started i was waiting on it just for them to hit me out of no where that i cant get aid so i couldnt even get the course materials and fell behind in all my senior level classes.

That massive financial stressed caused me to not do well in my classes and because of that i was dismissed from my major and had to change to a general business degree because it has a lower GPA requirement. I attempted to take my own life after this happened and was put into a psych hospital.

Then a month after that i was arrested by my campus police for skateboarding and had to use all my remaining money for rent and living expenses on legal fees and then had to drop out during the summer term due to all the financial hardship and PTSD i develop from a violent campus officer who was abusing his authority.

Im going back to school next month full time but i feel like because i cant get aid the financial hardship will be too much for me... i just want to graduate but i feel like the education system doesnt want me to succeed. 

Im just so tired of working s**ty minimum wage retail jobs... i want a career and for the past 10 years ive tried so hard to finish my undergrad but now that im almost at the finish line i dont see any hope..

I had to downgrade to a ""dumb major"" and now i have an arrest record so who would want to hire me now anyways... i feel like a complete failure

My student loans with the government are running out CTU told me so they told me to get another loan in the next few months and pay out of pocket on a balance I have in my student acct or they will have to withdraw me. I am a first generation student with no living parents so you would think my EFC is low but it’s not. I’ve had to retake a few classes so that has eaten up aid I could have used but it’s only been a few classes. 
I’ve seen some shady stuff about this “university” charging you for even logging into campus and they fees they charge are crazy high. I think it’s sketchy how all the sudden they have used up all my government aid and grants. 
I have core credits math and such completed at another legitimate university I can transfer once I pay them off. But I think they won’t matter because I have taken these same classes at CTU. So this isn’t the only college I’ve used my aid at. 

The problem is I wasn’t aware and didn’t do my research that CTU is in trouble with the state board of education for false advertising about jobs and screwing over veterans so I can’t get a loan from another source. CTU isn’t in the options list no matter what loan service I try. They might be accredited and this and that but the college itself is on pins and needles with the department of education. 

I read they have to remain open long enough for the current students to graduate and then they will be shut down unless they do a settlement. I’ve seen the settlement in the works and I don’t think I’d qualify to sue them because I don’t remember them explicitly telling me I was promised a job and I’m not a vet. Im just an un educated young person who picked the worst school possible for a IT computer degree. And soon just like those other sketchy universities you used to see on commercials making false promises and luring people in. Will I even be able to go back to it and complete my degree after I scrounge you money. I honestly want a refund!!!

I’m trying to get my credit score up now so I can get a personal loan and I’m so disappointed my school has let me down. I’ve had a long journey trying to complete college I’m now in my late 20s -between loosing family members and being homeless twice it’s been tough. I always have tried to withdraw in a timely manner or take it down to one class a month when it hits the fan so I conserve my aid and stuff. 
It’s just so sketchy how all my aid is used up and between the stuff I have read online and my own experience this school has treated us like a piggy bank. It’s been an expensive waste of my time and I can’t transfer because I owe them 4000$ on my student account too. 

I’m thinking about once again taking break or just stopping all together. I’m due with my first baby in less than a month and a half. I don’t think I have anything done enough to get my associates with what I have completed so far credit wise and if I did have the credits done -I can’t use it or graduate due to the student account balance.

337,leheaux,1597906308,/r/college/comments/id5ebi/im_afraid_i_wont_graduate_with_my_degree_on_time/,"I have never been good at math. As for elementary school I can barley remember much, but I know that I was good in all other classes except math. I remember almost getting left back in the 4th grade because I failed almost every test I had taken. I don’t know what happened, but maybe the whole “no child left behind” thing is what pushed me on to grade 5 even though I knew nothing. I only passed because my home room teacher really liked me and saw that I was excelling in all other courses.

In Jr high I failed math in 6th &amp; 7th grade. In 8th grade I had summer school for it, which didn’t help because summer school was 8 weeks of the teacher not teaching math,but having us do work that was unrelated, like writing paragraphs?

In Highschool I got all pitty passes because my highschool was a really shitty inner city school in Brooklyn. I was in algebra for all four years because I couldn’t grasp anything to get further. I even got a pity pass for chemistry. I never saw anything higher than a 60 on my math tests, And because my teachers saw that I was amazing in all my other classes and behaved well compared to most students, they just wanted me to move on. My math teacher even gave me a 65 my final year because she probably felt bad for me even though I failed every single test. (At one point I did have behavioral issues so idek if that is why they decided to just push me forward? The all had a meeting about me at one point and ever since they weren’t so hard on me I’m still not sure what my mother told them and the principle?)

I feel dumb because my fathers side of the family are all science or engineering majors. My father, and uncles tried to sit down and teach me and I cannot retain or comprehend math. I feel absolutely dumb. The best way to describe it is even though I can sit and learn a concept in math over and over, it doesn’t make any connections for me. I even watched YouTube and Khans academy for most of highschool; it felt like my brain could not grasp nothing. 

It’s ridiculous and sounds insane now that I’m writing this because it shows that I went through life failing math, but those teachers felt bad (or didn’t give a shit) and whenever my mother talked to them they seemed to not bother me in class or for the rest of the school year and passed me anyways. 

Right now I’m 5 classes away from getting my associates of science in addictions counseling. I have not even taken a placement exam or any math classes which is needed In order for me to graduate. I’m having panic attacks just thinking about math. I am an honors student with a great GPA who has no issues with any other courses, I even was an emt for a short time and that was a breeze for me.

I then went to commumity college and finished up my first 2 years. I then applied to transfer to a 4-year university, and STILL couldn't afford any of them, and my parent's credit scores are terrible, so they couldn't cosign my student loan.

I want to do film, but I'm not loaded, I live in hillbilly hell, and my parents think I'm stupid. What do I do??

I was supposed to go to film school in Athens, OH. That's been my plan since June 2019. My parents waited until AFTER I got accepted that winter to tell me it was too expensive. They tried to convince me to go to community college and gave me time to think about it. ""We can't technically force you to not go, [but basically you're doomed if you choose OU.]"" Even with the scholarships I got.

I did some research and chose not to go to college at all. My plan was to work a normal job until I could get an internship or something, get my foot into the door for any job opportunities in film. Film degrees are useless, start as a PA, etc. They essentially said ""okay."" and that was the end of it for a while. 

Then comes July, and my mom tells me I need a backup plan. Because I won't be able to support myself or some shit. She convinces me to go for x-ray technologist at the community college. My aunt did that, makes good money. I say fine. I apply- the program is closed. She tries to get me to waste two extra years taking shit classes so that my in-state scholarship (PROMISE) will cover everything for 4 years. I have to go for Something this year in order for the scholarship to be used. I say fuck no, I'm not spending more time in college for something I have no plans of doing for the next 30 years. I change my major last minute to culinary arts.

I like culinary. It's fun, I'm a good cook, I would be fine working in a restaurant until I can go Elsewhere. I live in BFE, I need to save before I can just head to NY or CA or somewhere with film opportunities. Culinary is fine. 

I get a job in the college town. Moving into apartment here within the next month. I show up to the weird Drive Thru Event to register for classes and they tell me I need to re-send a transcript, oh by the way your scholarship wont cover these expensive knives you need for class and a lot of other shit. Also you missed orientation. Also, the classes are at THE OTHER CAMPUS, an hour away. Also, I can't fucking drive and the DMV is booked beyond October due to COVID.

I'm moving even further away from the college I'm essentially being forced to go to. I thought I was gonna be within walking distance. Mom is trying to blame me for every inconvenience when this all could have been sorted before I even graduated in May, if she hadn't been so busy manipulating me.

So I'm going to have to get a ride from my mom to class every day, at least for whatever isn't online. She's pissed abt that. I'm pissed that my cashed out college fund is now gonna be used for college rather than a safety net. Sure, not all of it, but every little bit helps when you're an 18 year old working at subway.

I have to save up and essentially bust my ass to find a starter job in film, and move to wherever the hell it may be, which will undoubtedly be somewhere expensive. My parents are trying very hard not to tell me my dreams are fucking stupid and they would like me to die so that they can get rid of my roommate (who they dislike) and give my college fund to my 17 year old asshole brother.

But I have had a few student evaluations where students have remarked that I'm not very inspiring.  I'm not too worried about it, but it has made me interested in learning about what makes instructors *inspiring* to students.

I have always found this topic a bit difficult to navigate.  I do not share a lot of personal information about myself because it seems like it might come across as uncomfortable or unnecessary in a classroom setting.   I know some faculty who share some of their personal lives, and students enjoy it and find these stories inspirational.  I do not know how well that would really work, for me....

In my case, I came from an ultra-fundamentalist, evangelical family in Georgia where women were second class citizens, and my family tried everything they could to take me out of school because I'm a woman.  I fought hard to have an education, and I wanted to have a career.  So, I basically ran away from home at 17 with nothing, and I had to cut ties with my family, which was a very difficult thing to do.  I put myself through college and grad school, and I worked my ass off.  I am proud of myself for winning a fairly prestigious award for my graduate research.  My guests had a special seating area at graduation, but my husband was the only person there...none of my family attended.  But, at the end of the day, I still got myself there.  That said, I do not think this story is all that inspiring (and maybe it would end up too sad or too political somehow?).  I don't think there's anything I've necessarily done in my career that is that inspiring (I just study osteology and evolution).  

I tend to be more careful with what I say because it seems like anything could be misconstrued in a negative way.  I am envious of the professors who can speak their mind and not worry...  It seems that if I spoke my mind that freely, it would backfire tremendously.  I don't know...I have shown some documentaries that students found inspiring...but I don't think that really makes *me* inspiring.

However, my parents wanted me to attend a small private school. My top choice, F, rejected me. The private school my parents wanted me to go to, S, accepted me and gave me a good scholarship. I was mostly indifferent towards S (I stretched the truth hard after the tour) but I knew after I toured that I was going to end up there off of their wishes alone. Because they said I could only do fraternity rush at the small school as opposed to another big school I got in at, I relented and went to S. On the drive home from S, mom also informed me that I would be allowed to transfer if I wanted to after 2 years.

Present: Sophomore year starts and my excitement in going back to school is tepid at best. I miss my frat brothers and some other people but I’m just not all that hyped to start sophomore year. My first semester was great, but much of that had to do with the freshman high. My second semester was a totally different story. I was a victim in an incident with the guys on my floor (never told them about it as I didn’t want them to worry) that the HR department never contacted me back on, the deadness of the town on weekends became more apparent to me, and I just really hated my finance class to the point where I wanted to swap my major entirely! During coronacation, I realized that I just didn’t enjoy where I was at, lacked pride in my school and wanted to transfer after sophomore year to F, as they have a major (Sport Business) that I’m interested in and a center dedicated to Supply Chain Management (MBA prep right there). I’ve casually dropped hints over the summer that I want out. My mom, as F is her alma mater, sounded totally okay with it. My dad won’t hear it (He was opposed to me going to F in the first place had I gotten in).

I don’t know how to approach them on transferring. When I tried to bring this up over spring break they mostly brushed it off and told me I was just going through a rough patch (looking back I was, but still). They have a history of contradicting themselves too. When I toured my second choice, my mom said if that’s where I wanted to go (F2) then she’d be okay with it (I got into a higher ranked public school, F3, and she said that I could go to F3 but not F2). She also said after I got my SAT score that I was “too smart” for S and that they weren’t going to force it on me (looks like they walked back on that one too). I just know they’re just going to play stupid and walk back on their words and I have no clue how to convince them to let me transfer, especially into a major they’d consider a waste of time.

If my courses are online do you still suggest taking notes the traditional way (notebooks, binders, etc)? Any advice on how I can make sure I do not fall through the cracks and actually earn my degree with a good job at the end of this? I apologize if my questions sound silly. I am very nervous and want to make sure I am on the right track, and that my son knows when he's older his mother tried.

Some background: I’m about to turn 18 and all my life I’ve been running from challenges or things that were difficult. I also come from a pretty affluent background so everything I’ve ever wanted has been provided &amp; handed to me. 
I’ve moved high schools three times, never really tried in school or anything else for that matter, never had a job, or friends/a social life (a lot of this was due to my severe depression), and i don’t even have my drivers license. I also have a severe learning disability that made school real hard. 
As a result of not trying in school, i didn’t get into the colleges i applied to. (No surprise there). Now I’m going to some random school in the Midwest that I’ve never been to or heard of prior to applying with only 2000 students. I feel really behind, and am terrified of not having friends and being alone like most of my high school life. Most of my peers have their shit together (somewhat) &amp; have a general sense of what they want in life. I have nothing. My only interests are in music, and that will never turn into a career so it’s not worth pursuing professionally. 

I’m declared as an English major only because i don’t suck at writing, I’m not actually interested in reading or writing essays/discussing themes in books ect. Everyone keeps saying I’ll go to college and “figure it out,” but they don’t understand how apathetic i am to most things. What the fuck am i going to do as an adult? How am i going to make a career for myself when i can barley manage life as a teenager? I’m so scared for the future. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",college,Going to college with no life direction or interests - please help,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/i3v70p/going_to_college_with_no_life_direction_or/,1596604989.0

347,Kar1Mark,1596138899,/r/college/comments/i0sx4b/i_screwed_up_summer_classes_am_i_just_screwed/,"So here's the thing. I was an awful student in highschool, up until like senior year was the first point when I cared, but at that point like I couldn't save it. I mean, my grades werent like Failing but like, not something to be proud of. So I was told if I just got good grades in community college my HS grades wouldn't matter

So over the summer taking two classes I was killing one not doing too well in the other but was raising that ones grade, at one point I had a 98% in a class, and would still have around 95% with less effort and was going to use that to raise my grade in the other one cause I could be safe with a 95 and raise the other one. Then off course off all days for the internet to just shut off on me it was the day the midterm was due. I mean, maybe I should've done it a day early or something, but whatever, what, I didn't know it was going to happen, and heck I only even knew the midterm was due that day (it was probably in a sylabus, so yeah, maybe my fault, but like seriously, if the thing that caused the issue is not turning it in a day early, then come on, that just isn't fair) I emailed my teacher with attached a picture of a 98% on that test, and just hoped to get some points. I didn't get any.

My grade just because of that one thing from an 98% to so low that getting above a C was impossible. I got so incredibly frustrated that I just couldn't do it anymore. I ended up picking myself up a few days later and ended with a C. But that became so hard that Instead of being able to use that time to make progress on my other class I instead had to focus more on that class and then it was even harder to catch up, which caused a downhill spiral, which also caused me to get stuck and I ended up focusing so much that some days I wouldn't eat anything except for in the morning, and never left my room, which all came together to me spiraling in every way negatively, and I currently am finishing up a final essay and exam after a few days of just like ""I have a week for the essay and test, I need a few days of a break since this is not healthy"" so now I have until tomorow night to finish both, and Im gonna get a D or C in that class now. 

I just checked some website to see what it would take to raise to a 3.5, and I don't know how many credits a class was work, nor where to check, but if my next 3 classes are 5 points each I physically can't get a 3.5 (requires a average of like 4.3) and a 3.0 required a 3.6

But like in one day I switched from a healthy amount of work, I mean obviously working hard, but like it was healthy, to freaking out and spending every second just trying to get a grade of a C. I was pretty angry because if were being honest I did everything I could've. I mean, maybe I shouldn't have expected myself to go from a pretty bad student to straight A's, but still, I was succeeding, I was accomplishing those goals. It just was nice to see that as ""see, I can do it, if I work hard I can do it"" and then just suddenly it just fell apart, and the goals I had became impossible. I mean some people just said ""maybe it will take longer but if you don't let this screw you up its still possible"" and maybe that's true, but like, it would be nice if I could have time to deal with the frustration too. I mean, im still human, I can't just magically push through everything without ever taking a break, or anything, im not a robot. I mean, it kind of just feels like im doomed to failing. I mean, every time I've tried to do well in a class something happens that screws it up, I never expect it. Maybe I should be dealing with them better, but like I just don't know how to. I spent my whole life with helicopter parents and I never learned how to plan things and do stuff on my own. I was never able to make my own decisions, so now the first chance I get to do it, Im just straight up failing. I mean, im not even that sure why I care about the grades anyway, I mean I don't know what kinds of grades are needed. But its more of, this is the first time I've not been completely controlled in how I do stuff and even now I don't feel that in control. Combine that with just having to deal with trying to figure out a lot of other things, like I was diagnosed with autism, depression and anxiety this year. I graduated high school, I think I want to do film scoring, and I have no idea how to work towards getting into that field. I mean I can practice composing and everything, and I do, but like I need a job. I feel completely unprepared for everything, and this is all when there's a huge pandemic going on. I just feel like I need to figure everything out at once, and it feels like everyone else does. I mean, maybe they don't know everything, but atleast they aren't trying to figure out everything at once. 

I just don't think I can do this, its too much at once. It's just too much all at one time",college,"I screwed up summer classes, am I just screwed?",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/i0sx4b/i_screwed_up_summer_classes_am_i_just_screwed/,1596156899.0

For some background, I graduated undergrad with a 4.0 GPA, in Canada. In my first year, I had a pretty rough transition to the fast pace of college but due to having full-year credits, I managed to slowly devise study methods and patterns that led me to do well in all four years. If you are a freshman or having trouble achieving the grades you desire, then I would definitely read on (or watch on).

# How to Pick Courses

Let’s get this started! Before I talk about how I studied, I think it is best to start talking about how you go about picking a major and different courses. These choices can make or break your grade before you even study! To begin with, your goal should not be to pick bird courses, but rather, enroll in courses that are appealing and genuinely enjoyable (in your mind). This will lead to intrinsic motivation, that is, you will be motivated to study for the course material due to interest in the material rather than the grade. Trust me, it is so much easier to study, no matter how hard the course, when you are genuinely interested in the material being taught. For example, I was very interested in neurology and ended up enrolling in a neuroanatomy course. This course was very dense in material and was one of the hardest courses I took in undergrad, however, my interest in the material kept me motivated to study. Despite this, always consult ratemyprof (can be very inaccurate at times) and get feedback from upper year students regarding the instructors of certain courses. Don’t go picking courses blindly, folks. If the professor is a tough marker or even impossible marker, it doesn’t matter how smart or interested you are in a course, you are just tanking your GPA. So, pick courses that sound interesting and avoid any with bad feedback. This may be simple enough and you may do this, but it is good to reiterate, nonetheless.

# How I Studied for Science Courses

Alright so the course you enrolled in is perfect and the prof is fantastic! So how do you get the mark? For science courses, these are the steps that I took to get the A+

1. Before you even start studying, you need to remove any and all distractions
   - Stay on campus if your house is distracting, go to the library, go to Starbucks, just go wherever there are no friends or distractions. What if this isn’t possible (like now)? If you can’t go somewhere away from distractions, use noise-cancelling headphones, listen to 
                lofi, or listen to white noise so your mind doesn’t wander. I generally listened to rain sounds from “Rainy Mood” whenever this was the case.
   - I also put my phone on do not disturb mode. At the same time, I used an add-on for chrome ([StayFocusd](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en)) that blocked any browsing except for sites that I allowed. This allowed me to stop browsing on social media and losing focus while I was studying.

2. Next, I am someone who loses focus very frequently. To solve this, I eventually learned of the **pomodoro technique** to keep me on track and to allow me to study efficiently.
    - Steps of the technique from Wikipedia:
      - Decide on the task to be done.
      - Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).
      - Work on the task.
      - End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
      - If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes) and then 
             return to step 2; otherwise continue to step 6.
      - After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark 
             count to zero, then go to step 1.
    - This technique allows you to take frequent breaks so you don’t burn out. I tried to eat something or chill during my break. Try not to look at social media during your break as it is difficult to stop browsing after 5 minutes. 
    - Lastly, please reward yourself after any productive studying as this leads to delayed gratification.

3.	Finally, let’s talk about how I actually studied in university. I am going to be completely honest; I did not even know that my studying technique had a name. I eventually learned that it was called Spaced Repetition. I think the easiest way to explain this concept is to talk about my average week during university. For the sake of simplicity, let’s say that you are enrolled in only 3 courses (biology, physiology, and anatomy) where you have a 1-hour lecture for each course every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. To begin with, after my lectures I would take a break and then go to my studying area and do the following: 
     -	**(A)** Memorize powerpoint slides the same day as the lecture. It is very important to study the information the day you were presented the material as it is much easier to memorize and learn. I did not really consult my notes on that day as I was more concerned with first making sure I had the facts memorized (more on this in the next section). For each 1-hour lecture, it will probably take you 30 minutes to 1 hour to study the information presented that day.
       -	A very important point that I have to make is that you MUST actively study at all times. Active studying means that you are testing yourself on the material that you were taught. For example, I would read a line of the powerpoint slide and try to repeat the 
               material by looking away. Other methods include using flash cards (through quizlet or apps like anki), summarizing the information in your own words, or answering problem questions. In my experience, reading &amp; highlighting is only useful for understanding broad 
               concepts, however, when it comes to minute details, reading will not help. For example, biochem is jam packed with lots of facts and small details. The only way to really do well is by memorizing and you would do this by actively studying.
     -	**(B)** On the following day, I would do a quick review of the slides and my notes without rememorizing. Here you are trying to apply your notes to the facts you memorized. That is, this is the day you are trying to understand the broader concepts being taught. At the 
                same time, look up anything you do not understand or ask your professor (this is the day to do this). While memorizing is great, you must connect the information to truly get the top marks. For example, ask yourself what would happen if a specific enzyme in the 
                Kreb’s cycle stopped working.
     -	**(C)** Repeat steps A and B for the next lecture of the week (i.e. the lectures on Wednesday).
             -	A small note here: on Thursday when you are repeating step B for Wednesday’s lectures, I would also repeat step B for Monday’s lectures as well.
     -	**(D)** Once you get to the end of the week, spend early Saturday morning to rememorize the week’s material. At the same time, pull out your notes and connect the week’s material to the broader concept that was trying to be taught. After this week, you will repeat 
                steps A-D for the next week of lectures, however, on Saturdays I would also lightly review all past lectures. By doing this, not only is the information much easier to study and memorize, it is much more efficient as well.
     -	**(E)** 3 days (or 1 week) before the midterm exam, start rememorizing all material up until the midterm. Go through at least 2 cycles of rememorizations (I always did 3), and then spend the remaining time connecting everything with your notes and consulting other 
                resources for things you do not understand. If you have been following the spaced repetition from the very beginning, rememorizations should literally take a few hours MAX. You no longer have to go crazy and cram for 24 hours or 48 hours straight with no 
                breaks. This allows you to be stress free and happier overall.
     -  **(F)** Lastly, for final exams, I would start the same process as step E but this time 2 weeks before your exam date. Once again, spend a few days rememorizing then spend the remaining time going over concepts you do not understand while connecting notes to what 
                you memorized.
     - *A quick note on textbook readings. If you are not being directly tested from textbook (always ask your professor) then do not waste time reading or buying the textbook, powerpoint slides should suffice. However, if you are having trouble understanding certain 
                  concepts, then by all means read the textbooks. However, if your prof is also testing from the textbook, I would do all the steps I mentioned, but spend the weekend to quickly take notes from the textbook. I would then only start memorizing textbook material 1 
                  week before the midterm (as there was less weight put on this material)*
     -	**For a look at a sample timetable for studying in your average week, [click here](https://imgur.com/Zc5sFV6). For a look at a sample timetable for studying for your midterm exam, [click here](https://imgur.com/sGCZYvD).**

# Writing Courses

Alongside my major, I also had to pass some general education courses that were mostly writing. Here is my approach on how to get good grades in any writing course:

For writing courses, I did not memorize. If there were assigned readings, I would do them over the weekend and take notes. My notes acted as a summary of the material. During lecture, I would then take notes from the lecture and try to apply the different themes taught to the summary of the reading.

In terms of writing, the key to any essay is the thesis. A thesis needs to make an argument. It needs to be a controversial topic where both sides can reasonably defend their point of view. If your thesis is not controversial, then the paper you are writing is not arguing for anything, it is just restating facts. For essays always start couple of weeks before and write down a bunch of potential thesis ideas. Show these to your TA and professor and revise as needed. Once you have the go-ahead, write a proper outline slowly and keep editing the outline. Afterwards, start writing your essay. Do not try to write an essay 2 days before it is due, it just doesn’t work out.

Very importantly, you might think what you’ve written is good but these courses are very different and its best to follow your instructor’s feedback. Do not go against their word or else you will get a bad mark. Just because you think you have a good argument doesn’t mean the TA or prof will give you a good mark. It is all about what they think so always use their office hours and write what they think is best, not what you think is best. These courses are subjective so it is best to approach them this way.


---


# Math/Physics/Chemistry:

Generally, the prof makes or breaks these courses. These courses rely heavily on understanding abstract concepts so if not taught properly, it is difficult to do well. If you find that the instructors are difficult to understand, look at the possibility of taking the course in the summer in a different university (if you are really worried). If that is not an option then khan academy, organic chemistry tutor, and others on Youtube have proven to be great resources. Additionally, go to tutoring sessions on campus (if available) and visit the professor during office hours to make sure you are understanding concepts correctly.

Instead of memorizing like before, you want to read over the concepts and spend time after the lecture to do the assigned homework problems.

If you can’t solve a problem, spend as much time as you need and NEVER LOOK AT THE ANSWER! If you cannot solve without looking at the answer, you are not ready for any testing scenario. Do not look at the answers even if it takes you the whole day. Go over your notes and try to see what concepts are being examined by the problem and see if you’re missing something.

Mark any problems you had trouble solving so you can redo them later during the weekend to see if you understood the concepts being taught.

Really, with these courses, you are just grinding textbook problems. The “spaced repetition” for these courses is just making sure you are doing the problems for the sections as they are taught. The week before the exam, redo the problems assigned and try to complete sample practice tests.

---

Hopefully you will all be able to get the A+ in any course and I hope you learned something new! All the best everyone and good luck on your college journey!


TL;DR – Go to step #2",college,How I went from being a clueless freshman to graduating with a 4.0 GPA,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/hzpbw4/how_i_went_from_being_a_clueless_freshman_to/,1595996017.0
349,fgtthrowaway666,1595801042,/r/college/comments/hyftiq/am_i_wrong_to_be_upset_about_a_professor_refusing/,"This happened a couple years ago and I still think about it a lot because I feel it really negatively impacted my life in a big way. 

I was in my 4th semester of my pre-professional track biology degree. Up to this point I was pretty much a straight A student (couple Bs), never missed class, never was late on an assignment. I tried so hard to be a good student because my dream was to go to medical school.
 
So anyway, I was taking biochemistry that semester and was doing pretty good in the class. Sat in literally the first row and never missed a lecture. I say all this because I think it's relevant and why I'm so mad at how this professor handled the situation. 

So basically my body decided to betray me. I had a midterm exam in biochemistry. I didn't stay up late, I didn't drink the night before (I don't think or do any drugs at all) and I set 2 alarms, one of my phone and the one on my nightstand.

Somehow, despite all of this my body decided to just straight up sleep straight through both of my alarms. I woke up at 10 AM, the exam was scheduled for 8 AM and had already concluded. This had never happened before and it has never happened since, it was just this freak thing.

So I immediately e-mail the prof begging him to let me make up the exam. I considered lying about a family emergency or something, but knew I would be doubly fucked if he caught me in a lie so I was just honest and said I slept through my alarm. I thought he would be understanding considering he knows who I am, knows I sit in the front row and never miss a lecture, and was on track to get an A in his class. 

Of course you probably have figured by now, he said no. No make up exam. No extra credit projects. Basically, go fuck myself. Be more responsible in the future. Which I get, yeah it's my responsibility at the end of the day, but I find it hard to believe that everyone doesn't have some kind of 1-time freak accident where they sleep through their alarm at some point in their life.

So this was passed the drop/withdraw date for the class and getting a 0% on the midterm which counts for something like 35% of the final grade meant there's no possible way I could pass even if I got 100% on the final, so I stopped going to class and took the F.

The consequence of failing that class? I now have an F permanently on my record, even if I retake the class. I'm sure, as you guys know medical school is incredibly competitive and I most likely have slim to no chance of getting in with an F on my transcript. 

Also, I was on a scholarship that requires a 3.2 GPA or better. The F caused me to drop below that 3.2 for the semester and so I also lost my scholarship. I think there was some sort of way I could appeal to get it back but it wasn't any kind of guarantee.

So I could have just retaken the class and finished the degree but without the scholarship I would have ended up in a lot of debt and with a mostly useless biology degree with virtually no chance of being accepted to medical school. So I made the decision to just drop out and have been working in a warehouse for the past almost 2 years, barely getting by. I decided to get a 2 year degree at the local community college, which I just started last semester. 

If that professor could have just had an ounce of empathy for me and let me retake that exam I'd probably be in medical school right now. I wonder if he knew how badly this was going to fuck my life up he still would have refused to let me make it up.",college,Am I wrong to be upset about a professor refusing to allow me to take a make up exam?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/hyftiq/am_i_wrong_to_be_upset_about_a_professor_refusing/,1595819042.0

Earlier, I asked my parents if I could take a Leave of Absence for the Full Term Online Classes as I feel like I would only be risking my scholarship if I'm not able to give my best when doing school work and also so I could have more time to work on my final projects (which are due on the first 2 weeks of September). They didn't allow me. Online classes are hard for me, in general. I prefer face-to-face classes and going to school because I can focus on school only.

Long story short, I’m a 1st gen college student, my start to college was horrible &amp; I had no one to help me, I was first accepted in a private university away from my home town, then due to sexual assault within that city I wanted to go back home &amp; be some there closer to home. I moved to another private university in which things fell apart. I’m studying biology &amp; my grades &amp; GPA are screwed up, my advisor put me in upper level classes bc I was a semester ahead of schedule, apparently, I took microbio, human anatomy &amp; medical terminology all within a semester, I had a hard time keeping up that I got 2 D’s and then my next semester (Fall 2019) I retook microbiology and my advisor suggested ochem &amp; then added  English &amp; psychology and let me tell you that was a horrible year as well, I haven’t even finished my basics yet &amp; they threw me into upper level classes. I would walk around &amp; tried to get to know my professors &amp; tried to be involved in groups to be able to get tutoring &amp; as dumb as it sounded, no one texted me back when it came to study groups. 


My GPA dropped dramatically &amp; spring 2020 I brought it back up to a 2.0- I’m currently a junior. I’ve fallen behind and my expected graduation date is in 2022 instead of 2021, I feel like a failure and like an idiot, my dreams of being a Physician assistant/ optometrist have been shattered and now idk what to do with my biology degree.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 30, and I've made up mind to try college again. I failed pretty hard years ago but I think I'm in a place to make it happen this time, although I thought that before as well. I have F grades that would need to be replaced, I'm no longer eligible for gov aid, and I need to be able to work while taking classes. I also need to move to a different state within the next year and I'm afraid (maybe irrationally?) that no school there will take me because of my academic history. I'm already enrolled in online classes at a 2 year school here that I previously attended and they're basically a guaranteed acceptance into the major universities in this state. A big issue I'm running into when trying to decide what to do is the general advice of ""find something you want to do"". There is literally nothing I care to do or have even a moderate desire to do. Bio engineering was the closest to something I felt a ""calling"" to but even that was very general and there was no specific job I had in mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Years ago I tried a STEM degree, I bounced between Chem and Bio Engineering. I still sort of feel the need to go back to that but I don't know if I can handle the in person lectures and labs I would need to attend while also working. I also feel like I struggled with math, I thought about taking a lower level math to refresh and rebuild my skill level there but I really don't even know where to begin. When I was in this program before I remember other students just seemed to know what to do. They knew companies, employers, exact (and I mean EXACT) class and career paths for job titles I'd never even heard of. I felt like I was completely lost at sea without a even a life jacket while everyone else had their own boat and GPS. My interest in this line was very general and I no idea what to do with myself. Additionally, I know I will never be the strongest candidate for any jobs in the future with this degree. I'm so behind because of my age, I can't do unpaid internships, and I have absolutely no idea what my GPA will look like at the end since I already butchered it. Even if I could, I have no specific idea of a job or field I want and I have no idea how to get said clue. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently talked myself into pursuing and accounting degree instead. I don't have any particular desire for this, it was solely based on reliably being able to get a decent paying job and being something I'm pretty sure I wouldn't actively despise. I could also complete this online and wouldn't have to worry about getting into a new school in a different state. I've visited the accounting sub and I continuously see people wishing they'd gone into STEM or just something they enjoy more. The jobs are there but people don't seem to like being stuck in it. So now I feel like the tedious nature of this job is going to kill me in the future. I feel more and more panicked about this decision as times goes by. I only just started and I'm still trying to knock out some gen ed so it's not too late to change what I'm doing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know no one can just tell me what to do and this may not even be an appropriate submission for this sub. How does anyone know what they are doing? Seriously, how do people know what actual job they intend to go for? Am I right to be worried about being accepted into a school in a different state?  Is retrying for STEM after I previous failure a terrible idea? Is STEM at 30 a terrible idea? How can I figure out if I can handle the math and science of it when I can't figure out how to even gauge where I'm at? Is accounting actually great? Am I hitting a midlife crisis a few years early? I just want a job that I can actually live off of and that doesn't make me hate every single day of my life. I'm losing my mind over this, mostly because as a 30 year old with no particular strengths in any field and next to no money this is definitely my last chance to even try something.

I went to Mercer University last year on a full ride scholarship and absolutely hated it for many reasons- I won't waste your time talking about that, but it was really just an incredibly negative experience to the point that I decided that I wanted to transfer to Kennesaw State University, which is super close to my house. I'd be able to live at my 

I decided this early this year, before 2nd semester ended, and told my parents. My mom supported my decision at the time. As of now, though, she has done a complete 180- for months, she has insisted (by screaming violently and insulting me) that transferring is a horrible decision. For like a month and a half, I have tried to convince her this is the right option. I wrote an 11 page presentation that I gave to both my parents about why the transfer would be good for me, and made sure to hear out and respond to all my mom's concerns. 

However, each conversation I've had with her about this (including in group therapy) has literally devolved into her fiercely screaming at me. I have tried damn hard to accommodate her concerns for a really long time, but I have finally stopped trying to convince her and simply continued on with the transfer process. My Dad has been a mediator in the whole situation, and he has told me repeatedly that no matter what, the decision is mine (I'm 18 years old, for reference). However, now that I'm entering the final stages of transferring, my mom has made several threats that she seems to be deadly serious about. 

After hollering at both me and my dad, she said that if I transfer, I will either be kicked out, or she will move out of the house permanently with my dog. She also has made threats of making it as hard as possible to attend KSU for me. So, I'm really worried about what will happen if I complete this transfer, and thinking that it may destroy the family. But I also don't want to go back to a school where I will have an incredibly shitty experience just to appease my mother.  Any ideas on what I should do?

TL;DR- I'm in the process of transferring from Mercer University to Kennesaw State. It's worth mentioning that money is not an issue. Despite my best efforts to convince her that it is the right decision, my mom has made several threats about preventing me from attending school, kicking me out of the house, or moving out, taking my dog with her. My dad has acted as mostly a mediator, and still says the decision is mine, but hasn't actively supported any of my choices here and is taking my mom's threats seriously, which concerns me. Any ideas on what I should do? Is simply completing the transfer process without worrying about my mom's threats the right move?

and im delayed because of my own mental illness. im
bipolar and ive had a few long-lasting manic moments that led me to change majors a few times, because i thought (and thoroughly convinced myself) that i wanted to be a doctor, an astrophysicist, computer scientist. im a pretty good student with a 3.6 gpa as of right now, i think if i had worked really hard and powered through that could have been possible for me, but i lack that drive. those manic episodes are always followed by deep depressions, and have ended in me giving up twice now because i was so disappointed in myself i became suicidal. so basically that extra year and a half is due to 3-4 semesters that i lost from quitting and starting over. 

now im pretty mellowed out and just trying to finish with a ba in psychology but its not an impressive degree. its not something i love, its interesting sure but it feels like a waste of my time and money versus if i had stuck to one good degree. im disappointed in myself and i know i cant blame it all on my mental health because i never sought treatment. and my transcript is a clusterfuck of random courses (physics, biology, 2 years of chemistry, etc, from my degree path changing multiple times) that is over in units.

now im 21, going to be 23 when i graduate with what i feel is a low-effort degree that i “settled” for. but its too late to change it now unless i want to be held back even longer, and lets be realistic its not gonna open many doors (but neither will my networking skills).",college,i feel like ive wasted my college career. i wish i could start over,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/heh4yb/i_feel_like_ive_wasted_my_college_career_i_wish_i/,1592945661.0
357,mokenz,1592489015,/r/college/comments/hbf6fr/lost_in_my_fourth_year_of_undergrad/,"So I’m really in a weird spot and don’t know what to do with my academic career at this point. I’ve been in school for four years already because I went to an expensive private art school on a whim my freshman year (my parents kind of forced me into it). I had a really bad high school GPA because I missed a lot of school for physical and mental health reasons and family issues. Because of that I barely graduated. However I had a lot of volunteer hours, extracurriculars, a strong writing portfolio, and decent test grades. So I got into a private art school near my hometown and ended up using my VA benefits from my dad for the first year which the college then said I didn’t have in my last quarter which caused me to scramble to change my entire path or pay for classes. Turns out I did have it but they took my benefits anyway and forced me to take out loans (through FAFSA at least thank god. They sent me the money they took this year like 8,000 of it). I tried to stay at the school but teaching myself visual arts from the ground up to get a fashion degree was extremely difficult to justify to say the least even with some natural talent so I decided I wanted to switch into fashion merchandising and do product development stuff through that. Well I finally realized I couldn’t fit the bill for the school with other siblings all of college age, (even if I could the school was just full of scamming assholes), and so I went to community college instead so I could have some time to figure out what I wanted to do. I ended up working for a law firm as an administrative assistant and they needed paralegals so I decided to go ahead and get my AA degree so I could help them out, but I ended up quitting instead. I was supposed to transfer to a private college four hours from me and decided not to in the end because I was being dragged down by an ex who lived there and then decided to move to the north east. So I continued at community college and just finished my AA last semester at 21.

I recently decided to get my undergrad degree in advertising because what they did at my art school was really awesome and interesting. market research and branding all seemed right up my alley. I also decided that it’s better to just do what I’m familiar with which is writing and communications even if it’s a little tedious at times and the prospects aren’t good I have enough connections to get a job where I live even coming from my local state university. However the idea of making the same amount I make as an assistant after graduation seems really shitty. Most of my high school friends went away and studied all of these amazing things and graduated this year and basically all of them have decided to go to law school or grad school of some sort which I intend to do also, that or an MBA. 

While I don’t hate that I’m continuing what I did in high school basically I would like to feel more challenged. However I’m not sure if being an expert at communications would be better. I’m at a loss of whether or not to continue my degree in advertising or to go into marketing even though both are similar. My GPA is not bad but I have some struggles with math so the less I take the better. I can do well with statistics and things that interest me but I’m worried about having to take finance classes and graduating even later than I should when my projected graduation is next summer. I’ll be 23 and if I have to be in school longer than that I’m going to crack. 

As hard as I try I am pretty much a B+ average student. I’ve considered switching my major to something more interesting or easy like Psychology or sociology but I really don’t want to be a social worker or work for a school counseling office if I can even get a job in those things. I’m much more business oriented but I worry it’s such a saturated major that business or marketing will pretty much get me nothing unless I go into finance which sounds horrible to say the least. I really enjoy project management etc and I think I could do that with an advertising degree but honestly I’m more concerned with the idea that I won’t enjoy my career or that I won’t make enough to be happy and end up having to do law or get an MBA to make any money at all. I live in a mid sized town and financial success is a concern of mine especially since I want to have a family some day and hopefully I won’t be in school forever. 

I love learning and applying myself but I do worry that the rest of college is going to feel like going to community college again just learning arts or math and not really feeling like I’m gaining as much experience as I did when I went to a studio based art school. I guess that it is what it is but so far my college experience has been shit and the fears I have about getting a communications degree and nothing in stem (even though I know I’d fail miserably) scares me. I only have $7k in loans right now but that might change pretty soon.

I watched about 5-10  new shows during that semester. I was able to pass doing the bare minimum but I didn't feel great. I felt overwhelmed and just over it all. So, I dropped out and switched courses because I thought that was the problem. I tried that course and hated it so I dropped out again. Now I'm thinking of going back to my original course. Looking back now, I was addicted to streaming shows and taking my mind off having to study. I was extremely burnt out ( went straight from high school to university and worked about 30 hours a week). I wasn't in the right headspace to study and having know taken 6 months off I can proudly say taking a break was the best thing I've ever done.

I was one of the fastest and smartest students in kindergarten, learnt to age at age 3 and was the first one in class, etc. All of that changed when my parents couldn't pay for private schooling anymore so I had to attend classes at this horrible elementary school. I got behind maths at age 10 and I couldn't catch up properly ever since. My math teachers were terrible and taught everything mechanically, never explaining the process behind the solutions/train of thought. I felt useless and dumb, some of my peers were extremely good at maths, and that mostly was because their parents taught them at home, mine didn't because they hated maths. Most of my classmates absolutely hated the subject, though. I guess that was because it was horribly taught. They never gave us problems to solve, they just taught us arithmetic and that was it. My brain felt slow and sluggish, I was always behind my peers since then.

Fast forward to high school, it was also a mess (regarding maths). As I couldn't improve my analytical skills, I started getting really good at memorising things, I spoke 5 languages with no hassle in high school (the ones they taught us there). For some reason I had already learnt the ways of teaching maths in high school, which was the mechanical way, so I was, and this is what my teacher said, the best math student in my last year of HS. But here's the catch, I didn't know why the exercises were solved that way, nor why they chose that formula over that one, things like that. I just did it the way my teachers taught me to. And I dragged that until now. I'm at uni, I'm a year behind because I'm taking it easy for my sluggish brain, and I did good at most of my first year classes, but maths is still a problem for me. Everything is harder, and even though I understand most exercises, the ones in exams are really hard and I can't do them without assistance. I hate asking for help in these exercises, just doesn't feel genuine whenever I solve them. I'm scared I won't ever be able to be good at math and drop out because I'm slow. I don't want to, I love computers and everything about them, and engineering is amazing but I don't think I'll ever be able to be as good as the things I see on the net, nor even get to be a mediocre one. I don't want to drop out because of that, and end up taking language teaching classes because languages don't fulfill me, they bore me. 

I tried to go back to the basics in khan academy but I forget everything I learn, and I don't know why that happens.

So I’m most of the way through my first semester of the year but I don’t know if I can continue with classes if they’re going to be online. 

We started online classes about a month ago and I just don’t feel like I am managing in any shape or form! I feel so incapable right now and I have already gone through a rough first two years “learning how to study” (my studies are complicated by dyslexia , ADHD and few other chronic issues.) 

My first year was REALLY tough, m my second year was a lot better - but I still had significant issues because of personal problems. So basically I don’t have a strong academic record to start with. 

I feel like my best option is to defer because I just feel like the content is very inaccessible as it currently is given to us (mostly recorded videos, a copy of the slides, and notes.) but there’s a part of me that feels like I haven’t tried hard enough or worked hard enough. I’m a very ambitious person who has NEVER taken a break from schooling (straight from high school to undergrad) so this would be the first time I stopped studying. 

Any advice would be appreciated

363,Silent_Neighborhood,1591011588,/r/college/comments/guj2ys/wasted_several_years_of_my_life_due_to_poor/,"**TL;DR/Summary**: I've had a very abnormal life full of various obstacles and events that have strongly interfered with my education, resulting in me being a 25 year old (soon to be 26) agoraphobe/shut-in/hikikomori who is significantly uneducated. Neurological disorders like ADHD and Sluggish Cognitive Tempo, mood disorders like depression and anxiety, and abusive events bordering on trauma; along with truancy, are some things that interfered with my academic life. I know that I am somewhat ambitious, mainly because I want to have a career I enjoy, so I'm not willing to settle for something that doesn't stimulate me. The thing is, my experiences with the world have been so crushing to me, I've indulged in escapism after graduating high school. Now in my mid-20s, I've dug myself in a deep hole. I'm not even sure if there's a career out there that I would emotionally thrive in - something that provides flexibility and freedom, stimulates me mentally, and gives me some social status and high enough salary to sustain a life to enjoy hobbies outside of work. There's even a chance I may not be good enough for such a career. The first thing that comes to mind is something related to business. 

I also thought about writing a shorter version of what happened to me in school, but I decided to leave these parts in to give you a sense of how unskilled my writing is, which will further drive the point home that I'm uneducated.

**Long version:** When I was 5, I was diagnosed with Asperger's and ADHD. When I entered Kindergarten that year, I started having emotional difficulties. I hated routine and school felt like prison. I was placed in a specialized education program because I would have sudden outbursts, tease other students, and act like a class clown. One teacher scolded me harshly when I didn't feel like eating lunch, and I took it extremely hard. The experience was nearly traumatizing, and I started associating that experience with being corrected by other authority figures. I became afraid of my teacher, and the situation was so extreme, I was taken out of school until the New Year, when I started going to a new school in the district. I had the same emotional outbursts, and they lasted throughout the year.  


In first grade, I rapidly matured, drastically even, I became almost an entirely different person, was the stereotypical shy, quiet kid. I was able to function fine in class, even had a couple of female friends, was kind of a clique-ish group. Had some ADHD issues, but I was able to function in an academic setting. However, the school district was rigid in how they treated me. My memory isn't very clear on the events that transpired from this point on, so I'm kind of taking a shot in the dark. They insisted that I needed a paraprofessional to follow me around wherever I went, along with being transferred to another room occasionally. Certain people within the district even said that I didn't need these types of accommodations, referring to my significantly improved behavior, and thought that they were wasting resources on someone who didn't really need them. My mother fought for me, but her attempts to persuade people failed. This continued throughout elementary school into 4th grade, when I started going to another school in the same district because the school had overall significantly higher test scores than the one I was going to prior. My 4th grade homeroom teacher resembled my first Kindergarten teacher, was harsher towards me compared to her other students, gave me lower marks than my actual grades, and even made fun of me in front of students. I still had a paraprofessional following me around, even though I was able to function fine in the classroom, aside from being painfully shy. I was having nightmares about my teacher and became terrified of going into school. My mother had the last straw and decided to look for some private schools in the area, so I could have a fairer shake. Given that I had a documented diagnosis of Asperger's, that was essentially a bonafide ticket for enrollment in an approved private school for people with behavioral and emotional difficulties, and autism spectrum disorders.  


I started going there in the middle of the year, at the age of 9. I settled in very smoothly, especially in the next year. However, difficulties persisted, they were different difficulties, though. I had a teacher who was young, coming from a job in the city (around the projects). Looking back, it was apparent that she had some emotional issues of her own that interfered with her job. Ever see that movie School of Rock? Where Jack Black becomes a substitute teacher and decides to say ""screw it"" and lets his students do whatever they want, or things way outside of the standard curriculum? That was essentially my (what was supposed to be fifth grade) teacher. In afternoons, what were supposed to be math, social studies, and science; often we would just play board games or watch movies. On average we spent about 2 days a week doing that. She also had a penchant for acting, and she directed two school plays that starred our homeroom class, so that was also something that took a chunk of time. We probably spent well over 50% of afternoons away from normal academic curriculum. The next year, I had a different homeroom teacher, who wasn't abusive, but far more strict compared to my previous one. Later on that year, we had some communication issues, and I misinterpreted them because of my past experiences. I started become afraid of her, very similar to what happened in 4th grade, and my parents took me out of school until the next year. So, my math levels were still essentially at a fourth grade level, heading into 7th grade. Reading levels were probably impacted somewhat as well, and I had below average understandings of social studies and science. Language arts was the only subject I was competent at.  


Heading into 7th grade, I had a teacher I was far more comfortable with. The year was going smoothly, until events outside of school interfered with my education. Long story short, my father developed an addiction to stimulant prescription drugs a few years prior, and it started escalating to the point where he couldn't function anymore. He started losing jobs, which meant that as the breadwinner, he couldn't pay rent. We moved into my grandmothers house, and she kicked us out 2 weeks later. We became homeless, which led my parents to take me and my six year old sister out of school completely. An act of truancy. It was a very bizarre situation, my psychiatrist (who was not the one who diagnosed me with asperger's way earlier in my life) actually let my family live on the top story of his house for five years while my father received no help at all for his drug abuse. There are many more facets to this story, but as they're not relevant, I'll leave it at that. But during a three year span from the age of 12 to 15, I was out of school completely, spending all day on my computer, malnourished; eating nothing but processed junk food, and witnessing domestic violence. I became not only academically stunted, but socially stunted as well.  


I returned to school at the age of 15 in the middle of the year. It was the same school I went to, enrolling in the high school program. I saw some of my old friends, who were high functioning/asperger's or neurotypical with emotional difficulties/mood disorders like bipolar. I had trouble interacting with them and their friends. I became incredibly shy and withdrawn. In freshman and sophomore year, since I was still technically homeless, I didn't really have access to a shower, which meant I smelled horrible. All of these factors: being enrolled in an approved private school where some students have some form of autism, having a documented diagnosis of Asperger's, being very socially awkward, being behind my peers socially, having untreated ADHD to the point of developing significant executive function problems which surfaced often during hands-on activities (something I excelled at when I was a child) and not being a part of the 'socially elite' meant that various staff members patronized me and talked to me like I was a lower functioning autistic (or a ""moderate"" functioning person with autism). Condescending, overly friendly tone; nicknames like ""buddy"", ""bud"", and ""pal"", It actually took me until junior year for me to recognize this, and when I did, I was completely shaken to my core. There was a significant difference between the way staff members treated me and how they treated the highest functioning autistics (people with aspergers who were able to ""mask"" as NT) and NT students. I was clearly at a lower respect level. I inquired about why teachers were doing this, and it appeared that many didn't know about my family abuse, but some did and proceeded to treat me as lower functioning. I talked to three staff members about it: my guidance counselor (#1), my woodworking teacher (#2), and my language arts/writing and freshman year homeroom teacher (#3).  


When I called out #1 for the way he treated me, he acknowledged what he was doing. (FWIW, he also referred to the school as a dumping ground for students with behavioral issues). He was actually a somewhat nice guy, let me chill in his office when I had social anxiety and didn't feel like participating in activities, but he was somewhat patronizing. He told my mother I had a lot of potential, but he didn't treat me like the person he thought I could be - a recurring theme with other staff members to varying degrees.  


When I talked to #2 about how he talked to me and how he referred to me as ""buddy"" , he seemed to show remorse and apologize. A few months later, he talked to me in the same way with the same tone. He went out of his way to get me a gift, though?  


I talked with #3, since she was one of the very few staff members that actually talked to me like a relatively normal person. When I let her know what was going on about multiple staff members patronizing me, she acknowledged it and said that she didn't agree with that communication style. I remember breaking down crying, grateful of her respect I felt I didn't deserve.  


I started re-evaluating my life, found out what Asperger's was (I was completely ignorant of what autism was prior), asked my mother if I had it, found out I was diagnosed with it, and became terrified of my life and my future. I strongly considered for a while that they were right about me, and still do. I thought I was ""relatively retarded"", or incapable of functioning like a normal person; living independently and being able to communicate with my peers.  


The biggest problem is how I functioned academically. High school was a VERY loose ship, so to speak, which meant that academic issues stemming from poor concentration and social anxiety were able to fly under the radar. This is the most critical part of my high school experience. I graduate high school with what I estimate based on public school academic standards, poor grades, along with very low retention, completely uneducated because of the precedent that was set during freshman year; how I fixated and perseverated on why I just couldn't fit in, just withdrew into myself, didn't focus in class at all, just exclusively fixated on my self-consciousness, disassociated from everything very much like with the family abuse. I developed clinical depression and anxiety, which made it hard to grow as a person and figure out what I was really interested in, and what I wanted to do or follow through with. 

During this time I was in technical school, studying computer networking, but the combination of education gaps (reading comprehension) and poorly treated ADHD (tried nearly every single stimulant prescribed for it: Adderall, Abilify, Strattera, Concerta - none of them worked well) made it nearly impossible to focus. This was a huge missed opportunity in hindsight. Getting a CCNA at age 18/19 would have let me finance my student loans and possibly pay most of them off by age 25. I didn't want to be in a computer field long-term, but I found the salary enticing since it would have helped me afford college. Due to my lack of focus, I had to drop out of tech school right before graduating.  


After senior year I became extremely anxious, depressed, and started considering suicide. I became a hikikomori (not participating in society) that fall, and I haven't resolved my situation since. One of the few times I did leave my house, was when I participated in outpatient partial programs for mental health. I talked about my feelings on what happened in high school, autism, and potential limitations. I got along well with many of the people there, and one person who claimed to be the mother of someone with an ASD said that she didn't believe I was treated fairly based on how I expressed myself. I talked to a therapist about this stuff, and he said something to a similar effect, and also said ""I had a right to be angry about how I was treated by the people in my life"", which was interesting because I didn't directly state that I was mad, I was too busy questioning the validity of it to even notice if I was angry about it. I still am, because I was showing a select side of myself to others, so to speak.  


I've developed Sluggish Cognitive Tempo symptoms, which is currently recognized as a ""subtype of ADHD"", it's essentially a more severe version of attention deficit with symptoms similar to maladaptive daydreaming and poor executive dysfunction. I've taken an interest in many things such as sociology, psychology, politics, existential philosophy, but I lack the focus, energy, and knowledge base to grasp concepts which can allow me to learn about these subjects. I have so many holes in my overall understanding of the world, I only rely on a very vague idea spurred by my intuition. My vocabulary is limited and spotty and I frequently mix up definitions of words. My memory recall and processing speed are terrible. I'm completely unskilled and behind in life. When I was younger, I wanted to go to college so I could study meteorology, now I'm not even sure if college is a realistic option, given that I don't think I can juggle that and a social life. But it's still something to consider. However, I have multiple barriers preventing me from even attempting something like that.  


Now, I'm assuming that a lot of people would say that I should take advantage of services catered towards people with autism, like getting a case manager, job coach, and/or move into a group home, but 1) I've had severely untreated ADHD which has likely led to executive dysfunction. I am clumsy and forgetful and often make retarded mistakes doing basic things, but I wasn't like this at all when I was 12 or younger. Something caused this, whether it was my untreated disorder, developing coping mechanisms during family abuse (complex PTSD), poor diet and malnourishment. Why should I put myself into a box that may not even fit who I am naturally, if these are problems that can be fixed through therapy, prescription drugs, better diet, exercise, and other things. Also, it's likely that I will receive similar treatment to what I experienced in high school, given that they have training on how to communicate with various people and would probably be assume that I'm significantly different, functionally, and adjust communication. That wouldn't be good for my mental health at all, and reinforce intrusive thoughts and worries that I'm not good enough, that I am intrinsically broken. Doing things generally independently with traditional methods of help will be far better for my confidence and self-esteem.  


**The bottom line:** 

I'm trying to improve myself by catching up in the subjects I missed in school over a period of essentially 8 years. I'd estimate I'm at a 3rd or 4th grade level in math, 4th or 5th grade in reading, probably below 1st grade in science, with the only efficient area being writing, probably around 11th grade, maybe 12th grade at best, which would probably be somewhat below average at 25 years old. But besides a GED, I'm not entirely sure how to go about this. I've struggled to find any resources that could help me catch up to the point where I'm ready to enroll in college or near college education (online community college courses, to get credits to transfer to university are something I've considered)  
1) I'm worried that I may never be able to get a proper education because of the circumstances that interfered with my trajectory. I'm basing this off of something a therapist said to me once, something to the effect of ""it's going to be harder for you catch up at this point"" and suggested that I look into blue collar trades, which is something I could never see myself doing long-term. I wouldn't be happy working with my hands, stuff like that isn't mentally stimulating to me. 

2) I'm really not sure what I want to do with my life career wise. I'm very intrigued by sociology, despite knowing barely anything about it. The best idea I can come up with is: ideally, being a part of a team that spearheads something in society. A career focusing on problem solving, related to social sciences, maybe even political issues. It could even be a business endeavor. But also something that provides me enough salary to finance other things in my life. Being autistic could prevent me from succeeding in such a field though, depending on how it affects my social skills, I still don't have a clear enough idea due to being isolated for a long time. Also, I'm not even sure if I'm being realistic about this.",college,"Wasted several years of my life due to poor mental health and agorophobia. Completely uneducated.

I just finished my first year at college and I decided I needed to take a while off to really figure out what I want in life. School has never been for me, I tried to do my hardest but I feel like my un-enthusiasm and lack of true interest has always held me back from being a perfect student. I feel like needing a college degree has been drilled into our heads as necessary to be successful, when in reality a bunch of people get degrees and are stuck in jobs they hate or are still unemployed. I want to take the time away from school to see if I can become successful in something I’m passionate about (owning my own business) and not feel like I need to waste four years and a fortune for an education that won’t guarantee anything. However, if that does not work out and I do become passionate about something I’d need an education in (law, teaching, etc) I would want to return to school. My GPA was not the best this school year (2.7 first semester and 2.3 second), there’s no excuse for it and it is what it is, so my question is: if I take two or three years away from university to find something I’m truly passionate about and decide to re apply to another school, will they take my GPA less into consideration and more where I am in life and my experiences? I am a hard worker and got into college purely based on a test score and an essay, I have passion and motivation to do things right when I’m doing something I love. That’s why I felt college wasn’t for me, I hated it and therefor I let that bring me and my gpa down.

I graduated with my BA this semester. While I am glad I was able to finish and do fairly well, part of me is sad looking at my time in school because I didn't really make any real friends that lasted for longer than a semester. 

I tried to join some clubs at my school, but never went to more than a few meetings because I just felt disinterested and/or awkward going by myself. I had roommates though most of the time we barely talked and the few conversations we had were pretty superficial. I also have never been in a real romantic relationship, or even kissed anyone. I guess it's because I'm pretty introverted with some slight social anxiety, and I find it hard to connect with others. 

I know it's possible to make friends and form relationships after college, but from what I've been told it gets a lot harder.

371,College_Student12345,1588309772,/r/college/comments/gbc34h/quarantine_has_made_me_realize_that_i_hate_my/,"My major is Chemistry. I am one month away from graduating from community college and transferring to a university. Tomorrow morning, I have to pick my summer classes. I am finishing my general Chemistry classes this semester, so I should be starting Organic Chemistry this summer, as well as continuing with Calculus.

&amp;#x200B;

But I just can’t do it anymore. I never cared about Chemistry in the first place. The only reason I picked it as my major is because I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do after graduation, and a Chemistry degree opes you up to a lot of opportunities. Honestly, the only thing that was powering me through my classes was the social aspect. I enjoyed my professor, doing the labs, and had lots of friends in my class. Because of that, I was able to push through and force myself to study. But now, with everything being online, all of that is gone — besides the studying. All I do all day long is study for quiz after quiz, test after test, and do homework assignments after homework assignment. And it’s made me realize that I just. Don’t. Care. If I did get my degree in Chemistry, my plan was to become a Medical Laboratory Scientist. But if I can’t even finish my bachelor’s, is that really the path for me?

&amp;#x200B;

My original major before Chemistry was Environmental Science. I was actually somewhat excited about that, and I could study the material and not be bored out of my mind. But the reason why I changed my major was the job market. While climate change is slowly killing the planet and everything on it, getting a job with an environmental science degree is next to impossible. You’d be hard-pressed to get a job that pays your bills. The only reasonable jobs are working for the government, but those are hard to get and they also require a lot of travel, which I don’t like. Come to think of it, pretty much any job in environmental science requires traveling, so I’m not sure how that would work out for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Part of me wants to get my degree in Environmental Science and then create a start-up. It’s always been a dream of mine to be self-employed. But how would that even work? There just isn’t a lot of money to be made here. Another thing is that I’ve only ever taken one Environmental Science class. While I enjoyed it, I have no clue how much I would enjoy the upper-division stuff. Also, as a transfer student, changing my major would be difficult, especially if I do it later on. My school requires you get approval from the head of your current major’s department, the new major’s department, and if you’re changing colleges within the university (which I would be), you need approval from the head of the college. That’s why it’s so important that I make this decision now; I only have lower-division classes right now, and changing my major later on would be nearly impossible. Which leads me to my next point — 

&amp;#x200B;

On top of everything else, I just want to work. I’m tired of studying, I’ve spent years and years trying to find a major that I truly enjoy, and there’s just nothing there. Environmental Science is the closest I’ve come to that, but like I said, there isn’t much earning potential and I can’t guarantee that I actually would enjoy it. I really want to drop out and just get some ordinary job. But I can’t bring myself to do that, because

&amp;#x200B;

1. I feel like I would regret it later on
2. I got accepted into my dream school, which is one of the top schools in the country. Even if I don’t have a major that I like, I know for certain that I love this school and want to attend here

&amp;#x200B;

I am also an extremely fidgety person because of my anxiety. Even just sitting down to write this is difficult for me. Studying takes a lot of energy out of me. Part of me wants to drop out and just go into a trade where I can work with my hands all day, like welding or carpentry or something. But I’m hesitant to do that for the reasons I mentioned above.

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize for the abundance of info, but all of this has been consuming my thoughts and I need someone to give me some clarity. I’ve tried my absolute best to decide what’s right for me, but it doesn’t seem like there’s a clear choice.

Then in junior year I got really serious (mostly As and Bs and tried my best, and same thing for senior year. I am about to graduate, and I realized I am going to get a B in one of my classes which frustrates me. When I started getting serious about school, I started using the grad school approach to grades. I know this isn’t necessarily a hard and fast rule, but you know how in grad school, the rule of thumb is that you *should* getting A’s in you coursework? I started really applying that to undergrad, and B’s started really disappointing me. Whereas in freshman/sophomore year I would have been content with a B.....now they bother me. B’s bother me mostly because I feel like they could have been A’s with just a little more effort. And they also bother me now because sometimes it means that I had an A in that class all semester, but then as the work progressively got harder towards the end (or I slipped up and turned an assignment in late due to other schoolwork), my grade would inevitably drop to a B. B’s just really frustrate me now because (with the exception of a few courses), honestly I should be doing A level work. I am a poly sci major, and I just feel like for the most part if I turn in assignments on time and do a relatively decent job on them and I should be able to maintain A’s - the coursework itself isn’t hard. It is when I slip up and turn something in late that messes up my grade. Basically, to me, B’s feel very average. It feels like what good students (who do good work), but have other life circumstances (long hours at work, a family to take care of, mental/physical limitations, etc.) at play receive.

373,KojaCola,1588138383,/r/college/comments/ga3mjc/in_need_of_advice/,"Hello all,

I’m a freshman at a small liberal arts college and I’m getting anxious about my future endeavors. My first semester went well except for one class. I decided to take economics based on my advisor’s recommendation. The first half of the course went well, but then things went downhill real fast. I ended the course with a D and it made my GPA 2.68. I’m not used to being in this kind of situation. I did well in high school and had a 3.8 GPA (non weighted). 

I was completely distraught after this because I tried really hard to understand the material (late night studying sessions, going to the professor) but I couldn’t get it together for the final exam. The class was not fun and none of the students talked to each other nor did they like the professor. I’m not blaming it on the circumstances, but it definitely didn’t help.

Anyway, my dream would be to go to a good graduate school and study international relations. My question is; will this one grade affect my chances of getting into a good graduate school? (I’m looking at probably GW or American for graduate). 

Thanks for your advice!",college,In need of advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ga3mjc/in_need_of_advice/,1588156383.0
374,wauturmeluns,1587987371,/r/college/comments/g8z31t/overthinking_my_choice_of_postsecondary/,"To sum it up, the title is basically my problem. Don’t know if it means anything but I’m in Canada. I’m a senior in highschool and the acceptance due date is May 1st for both the schools I applied/was accepted into. The thing is that I have already accepted one of the my options thinking it was the right choice and was tired of juggling which one I wanted to go to. 

Growing up, I’ve never been able to stick to one interest and would constantly switch what I wanted to be when I grew up or simply had no idea. I still have no idea. I think I’m intelligent enough to do well in things if I put my mind on it. I would be promoted at jobs, had 95% average, am more naturally-artistically incline so I enjoy drawing and stuff. Not going to school isn’t an option due to my parents and trust me, i won’t defy their wishes. They aren’t forcing careers or paths onto me but they just want me in school or I’m kicked out.

So I settled for applying to UBC’s faculty of arts, and SFU’s interactive arts and technology program. Kind of a big difference I guess. To summarize why I chose the programs:

UBC: faculty of arts, undeclared, basically I can test the waters in a bunch of areas and see what I like and give myself time and options. I’ve been interested in business and psychology but never really got to delve into it in highschool so this option allows me to take courses in those areas as well so I can kind of flip-flop everywhere—don’t know if that’s good or not. I do prefer the campus and the student life looks more ideal here. Don’t know what jobs I would look for on this path but was considering switching into business.

SFU: iat program, I’ve always been interested in computers but could never understand them no matter how hard I tried. Took 2 programming courses, my mind just isn’t able to function in that area haha. This program is pretty interesting but I didn’t want to minimize my future options. I know you can transfer and such but Im just scared of the idea of dedicating myself within a certain area if you know what I mean. The program is pretty unique and not well-known but has pretty interesting and well-paid career options afterwords(UX design, UI design)—that’s only if I stay interested in the program.

Both options are about 1-1.5 hours away from where I live so either way I’ll be transiting 2-3hours a day. Anyway, I chose UBC because in the moment I thought it was the best option for me; however, NOW I’m overthinking and maybe SFU would be better. It’s a really small program—like ~70 students per year enter it due to it not being well-known. It’s like an artistic computer programming major? They have 3 focus areas and the most eye-catching one was design to me. The school also offers international co-op which is really cool. Omg now that I’m going on and on, I’m being totally biased towards this program. 

The biggest reasons I didn’t choose SFU was because I’m absolutely terrible with computers, can’t code to save my life or figure out the proper tools for adobe illustrator after 2 years. As said before, I constantly switch my interests and wants. The student life doesn’t appeal to me as much as it kind of seems like highschool 2.0 with small classes and no school spirit. I can also take similar classes like graphic design at UBC. And I already paid the $500 admission to UBC so I don’t think my parents want to pay for SFU. Honestly I don’t know what I want to do. Now that I’m looking over my mini overthinking speech, SFU sounds really fun. UBC sounds fun too though, just a way looser grasp on what future I’d have. I sound like the worst kid ever lol I feel bad for my parents. Maybe because I keep comparing myself to majority of my friends heading into sciences and having paths prepared, I just hate feeling like I’m going nowhere.",college,Overthinking my choice of post-secondary,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/g8z31t/overthinking_my_choice_of_postsecondary/,1588005371.0
375,ambitiouslearner123,1587235512,/r/college/comments/g3sngn/need_some_perspective_on_this_one_professor_who/,"Let me preface by saying this: I used to think that when little kids get bad grades and then they blame their teacher by saying things like ""he/she doesn't like me"", I think no. We need to look at the bigger picture here. There are cases where the student didn't study enough and got bad grades and now the student refuses to except responsibility so the student blames everyone else.

However, there are also cases where the student is correct in assessing that the teacher genuinely does not like the student and purposefully gives bad grades. This scenario requires proof. Also the student needs to mentally reflect why the teacher does not like him, what events lead to this, and what he can do in the future, and/or how to build better relationships with people.

This is a story about Professor Aly (not real name). Professor Aly got a biology lecturer position at a top tier uni in the USA. She can't make tenure position yet because she is still studying for PhD at uni ABC. She also does not have speculator research, high research index, or enormous funding from the NIH/NSF/DoD or whatever government agency. Usually all these things are looked at whenever the dean selects a professor to be on the tenure track. Also, masters and PhD candidates can be adjuncts and supplement their own tuition by teaching intro-undergrad classes. Or they can be TAs at intro to upper level classes. This is normal.

Over the years, Professor Aly has shown her true colors of being a sham, a con, and overall nut job. While she was a PhD candidate at Uni ABC, along the way she must have left or been fired from her lab because the PI removed her from the lab's official website. \[More details below\].

Her PhD is something along the lines of computational neuroscience. It sounds fancy and hard. It is. I don't doubt or look down at some people who either fail out of a tough PhD or they leave because they are no longer interested in academia. *I don't judge. STEM PhD is hard.*

However, what is odd by me is the sheer number of unrelated classes taught by Professor Aly. I said I was fine with her teaching introduction to bio since that is a very basic class. I myself had 2 years of biology before entering college so introduction to bio was a breeze. Since she was a Computational Neuroscience PhD, she also taught a Computational Neuroscience class.

But Professor Aly was teaching other classes such as Genetics, Biostatistics, Molecular and Cell Biology, Advanced Molecular and Cell Biology, and Nutrition. None of those classes seem related to her field of study, and in class she demonstrated that she had no level of mastery. She would make a lot of mistakes. She would also teach outdated information especially in the field of Molecular and Cell Biology. Even in the advanced fields which were approaching graduate level work and recent research papers, Professor Aly showed that she did not have the slightest clue what was going on in the field, in research, or what the paper was about.

**She would even read a retracted paper and not know what retracted was, and that the information was garbage**.

Her teaching style was poorly executed too. She often spoke too fast. Even when students tried to ask her to slow down, she refused. She wanted to get out of class 30 minutes early every day because it was clear she did not know the material enough to teach. Eventually she stopped trying to read and summarize research papers for us. **She moved onto reading the Huffington post, and other popsci content**. She approached psuedoscience territory by promoting vitamins as cures for cancer and diabetes.

Only in 2 classes did she grade the material. As the University policy dictated that most midterms and finals needed to be short answers and long answers to prove knowledge: *having exams be written left the door open to subjectivity and interpretation.*

If exams were all multiple choice, then it's either right or wrong. Either you selected the correct bubble or not. This also leaves the students grade to chance or luck as random circles can determine your fate.

Anyway Professor Aly abused that written exam policy to her advantage. If she didn't like a student, she would give students straight C's and B-'s, which are straight killers especially for Biology majors who are Pre-meds and want a 3.8 GPA (or A- in all of undergrad classes) to apply to medical school).

If you tried to politely ask why you got a bad grade, **she would say the answer is wrong. When you show her Google or the textbook, she would say your answer wasn't detailed enough**.

***\^That is how she abused the written exam policy.***

But students that she did like: their exams could be filled with garbage or the wrong answers and they would still get full credit. Students have pushed pseudoscience and homeopathy on genetics exams and still got credit. Or students wrote completely wrong information, as debunked by Google and fact checked by established and qualified biology PhD professors.

Professor Aly only graded 2 classes herself. The other classes, she allowed an undergrad TA grade everything. Since the TA was an undergraduate student, and the same age as the rest of the class, you can already see the shear favoritism and corruption in this grading. Also many of the TAs were not qualified to grade. Yes MANY TAs. I have had *TAs who were finance engineers* who took only 2 biology classes and they were grading exams. There is also the potential FERPA violations of letting your peers see your entire exam and homework and university login credentials.

One TA even accidentally leaked everyone's grades on Snapchat. This actually happened.

Behind the backdoors of the TAs, they talked about how much they hated Professor Aly because they got abused, she blackmailed them, **she made them do stupid things like count ketchup packets in the cafeteria and write a report about it.**

She and another biology professor were eventually caught because they stole money and used that money to pay their TAs in University XYZ. Yes, she stole money from this uni to pay for her TAs in another uni.

Many wanted to report Professor Aly but they knew they couldn't because they would jeopardize themselves. In addition to teaching core classes required to graduate, and thus your fate was sealed by her discretion,

Professor Aly was also an advisor and a pre-health committee member. So in order to get a biology degree, you needed to kiss her ass for 4 years straight. If you wanted to go to medical or dental school, you need a health committee member's letter. She has denied this letter to at least 10 students who all left crying and confused as they were ineligible to apply. Some had decent GPA of 3.5 \[not super competitive, but semi-competitive\] yet she still would not let them apply. She forced students to take SMPs or Post-bacs or masters.

Why was she even on the health committee when she had no relevant experience or degrees to prove herself? She never been to medical school nor had a MD, PhD, or DO.

So now imagine having 6 Cs on your transcript and being in lecture with a complete nutjob who didn't even teach real science and who wasn't a PhD scientist herself.

Eventually a lot of the alumni with nothing left to lose, reported her. But they didn't report her to Director of the program. The director of the program would never have done anything as he was complicit in the money embezzlement to some extent.

I have seen so many tears and even possible suicide attempts in this program and many attribute it to Professor Aly and the way she treated people. At least 4 of my friends expressed concerns for their own mental health over Professor Aly.

Before taking Professor Aly's classes, I had a 3.8 GPA. When I was in the rollercoaster, it went to a 2.8 GPA. Before I blame anyone, I asked myself so many questions and how to improve myself. Also transferring out of the program would have hard and impose a financial burden that would set me back $100,000.

It never mattered to me how hard I studied or how long. Professor Aly told me she never liked me because she and I disagreed on politics. That's very unprofessional and that does not give her the right to mess up my grades and future. Again, I even had to fact checked by exams by Google and by other biology professors at other universities.

What is weird is that as a 20 year old, I had more research experience and papers than her. I had 1 research paper and she had 0. She also spent 7 years in a PhD and still managed to come out with 0 papers. No wonder she was fired.

Since the director was not going to do anything, there was perfect timing when the university appointed a new incoming department chair. This department chair was going to replace the old department chair who was too involved in research and not in the dramas. Once the alumni started to report her to the new department chair, soon the current students from freshman to seniors reported her. Eventually she was fired and everyone had a celebration with cake in the lounge and so much profanity was used to describe her. By then, I was a senior and about to graduate.

My undergrad GPA is still tanked from all the bad grades she gave me. I still have video and audio lecture recordings of her pseudoscience. I still have copies of her poorly graded exams. I submitted them all to the university to thoroughly investigate.",college,Need some perspective on this: One professor who ruined many students' lives and careers,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/g3sngn/need_some_perspective_on_this_one_professor_who/,1587253512.0

I went into college as an Environmental Science major taking Bio 1 first semester and planning to take chemistry sophomore year. I ended up not doing well in Bio 1 and dropped it in November so it wouldn’t hurt my GPA but i finished the lab. I feel like if i really tried at the end of the semester i might have been able to get better than a C- but i can’t change that now. Since i wanted to be a bio major all throughout high school i don’t want to give up on it so easily. However, dropping it has definitely affected my passion and confidence in the biology field. I am currently taking a psychology course and a stats course and took AP stats in high school. I am also going to be retaking Bio 1 over the summer at a community college. 
       Fall semester 2020 i will be taking Bio 3 and some other courses including psy and stats. The question is if I should take chemistry or not. I don’t have much interest in chemistry but it is a requirement for bio majors. with the lab it is 5 credits, so if i don’t take it I could take both another stats and another psy course. 
      The major dilemma here is that i just don’t really know what to do. I used to be passionate about biology but not really anymore and the lab assignments were always very hard for me. I don’t want to give up on it that easily but it was a pretty hard class for me and thinking about taking those labs again is not a good thought. However, the thought of giving up on my biology path because i was not smart enough or was too lazy is not good either. I don’t mind data science but i’m really only perusing it because i could get a good job in it not because i enjoy it. I have liked my psy class this semester but it is only psy 101 so it’s pretty easy and i don’t really know what higher up psy could be like. Also with all of these i don’t know what kind of job i would really be able to get or be interested in while also making a decent wage.

379,PM_ME_YOUR_TUTURUS,1585397036,/r/college/comments/fqixqf/switching_from_a_us_university_to_a_uk_university/,"Long post sorry! I graduated high school as an 18 year old almost 3 years ago and have been fumbling at university here in America ever since. I went to a very rural, underfunded HS where no one received a good education- state government was on the verge of stepping in due to high illiteracy and fail rates- and so I did not get any guidance on college either. I have several conditions such as Autism, PTSD, ADHD, and anxiety, and I did not get an IEP plan in high school. Some of my teachers would even mark me down for no eye contact. I have grown up with no parents, hardly any family, and no support network. Needless to say, I did not have a good foundation to begin university, and there were no community colleges nearby.

I have transferred colleges twice, as I originally had to go to a 4-year commuter college that did not offer my major. I transferred to a big state school, and realized it was not feasible due to the high cost of living, not being able to get into needed classes, commuting, fees for being selected for the honors program, etc. Also I did not fit in socially with the culture of my school.

 I applied to over a dozen schools to transfer here in the US, with a 32 ACT and an almost 3.8 GPA at the time as a computer science major, I got denied everywhere except a smaller private school where I got good aid. This school was not a good fit for me, but I wanted to switch to Neuroscience and this was one of the few schools that offered my program.

I can honestly say that I'm absolutely miserable at my school. Even with documentation, I could not really get any disability accommodations. I've tried very hard to put myself out there throughout college- I did an AI research internship, I used to have a part time job, I do volunteer biology research, I was in student council, I am in several competitive debate clubs and even won awards, I joined a sorority that sucked money from me, but I simply do not fit in with the upper-class greek dominated party culture of my school.

 I was told others are bullying me and I didn't even notice I guess because I am so autistic. I have tried medication and it hasn't helped, the loneliness and depression is crushing, and the counseling center at my school said my case was too complex. I feel like if I stayed at my school, despite the great financial aid, I'd end up hurting myself.

My school has so many random general education classes that have impeded me a lot. Originally I was trying to do a double major, but it simply isn't feasible due to the enormous amounts of gen ed classes I have to take. I struggle so much in these classes that have nothing to do with my major, like Physics, as well as the fact that nothing is standardized. One professor will say only 10% can get an A while if you luck out and get another professor no one will fail. 

 I have had disorganized professors throughout college, including one last semester who accidentally gave me a failing grade when I had actually scored a 90 something on my exam, and just sort of said oops when I told him about it. I had a professor curse in my face because I asked her office hours, who I reported to the dean, and nothing was done. My classes are so scattered, unorganized, and the expectations are never clearly laid out which is what someone like me with autism needs.

On a whim, I applied to UK schools after my partner told me about their experience in the UK with a degree. To my surprise, I was accepted to the University of Exeter, a very good university in England. It would be a hefty investment and take every bit of savings and assets I have, maybe a little debt, but it seems like the UK system of specialization is a much better fit for me than what we have here.

My new school has specific services for autistic students, has every class I will take over the next 3 years laid out, has better on campus housing options so I am not forced to live in the same room with someone who screeches and plays loud music 2 ft away from me everyday like I have been the past year, and has a very good reputation for my program. 

Also, I feel like I have missed out every chance to have 'the college experience' as I have made no friends. I think starting from 0 alongside everyone else would give me a better chance to finally have friends, because I went to a commuter school we never really had any social events for freshman.

I see a lot of kids being forced by their parents into fields they're not passionate and it concerns me. I absolutely love my major, the career prospects, and feel very lucky that I am driven with a passion for doing what I love. I don't know if it's just my school with a high acceptance rate, but I've been seeing a trend. 

It breaks my heart how many people in my classes are being forced into nursing by their parents. They  aren't given a license and opportunity to explore what they enjoy. They're expected to just attend classes and never question their parent's judgement. Or, they're forcing to double major and deal with a ridiculous amount of stress. My friend is trying to double major in music (demanding major with ten classes) and balance his parents' desire for him to go into speech pathology, and it's a lot for him to handle. 

I had to counsel a friend in my psychology class about his parents wanting him to go into nursing. His real passion was computer science or business, and I had to tell him that at the end of the day, his parents are just people with a certain opinion about what career he should go into. If he did become a nurse to please them but never followed his true passion, that wouldn't have been good for anyone. I dunno about you guys but I can't serve people well when I'm not happy. I can't be there, be present, if I don't love what I'm doing.

I realize not everyone has the ability to pursue a career they're passionate about. Sometimes familial financial stressors are real and a healthcare profession can help a lot. For a lot of people, college is a number's game to get a better life, and I wholly respect that. I'm just saying that parents don't have to be the end-all be all in deciding where a child's life will go. There's other fields and disciplines, and allowing exploration is healthy, even beneficial. Everything will go smoother if the student is studying something they actually enjoy. 

Forcing a child to pursue a career in one discipline while ignoring the profitability of others is my main concern. Especially when forcing someone into a healthcare field, this can have real consequences. Those who pursued a college education to please their parents who find themselves stuck in a career serving others that they do not enjoy does not serve anyone well. 

I also see an alarming number of students go straight into college without doing any market research. Lots of kids have ideas of going to grad school, but there are other ways to get into fields like physical therapy that are a lot more immediate and therefore provide more experience faster. Having all the information you can about a field you're going into is important, having a realistic view before commuting tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars into something that might not be a true passion is important.  

I feel like associate's degrees are underrated. I know loads of kinesiology majors wanting to go into physical therapy, and while getting a bachelor's degree can be great, getting an associate's could make more sense. I've seen physical therapy assistant salaries are pretty great, you get your hands into the field sooner, better return on investment, and if PT does end up not being the right choice, they can always get a bachelor's degree. I've seen loads of openings for this kind of position, there is market demand, and it doesn't make sense to me to major in something you've never really tried out in the real world. 

I read somewhere that the average amount of times people change their careers throughout their lifespan is five to seven times. That's a lot of career changes. Doing market research is also important to make sure that what you're majoring in will pay off. Loads of popular majors like Biology, English, Social sciences, and others have a pretty high percentage of people that regret their major decision. While there are some advantages to these fields and there's nothing wrong with absolutely loving them, having a realistic idea of what life will be like after graduation is important.

Throughout several ""draw my life"" videos I've watched, the darkest time people mention is usually when they graduate college and face the real world. In my local area there is actually a support group for such people on how much reality can bite. It's hard when you had a great time studying anthropology, but can only get a job as a dental receptionist. My friend actually had to move to another state for better cost of living.

Going to grad school doesn't have to be right after college. My mom got her master's degree in her fifties, and her world experience gave her advantages as an applicant. I feel like lots of people say they want to pursue a PhD, and that's great. However, there are some issues with oversaturated fields and limited tenured job opportunities. Things are different in today's world than they were for our professors. 

I see lots of psychology majors who intend to go to graduate school, and that's great. We always need more healthcare professionals. However, a psychology degree on its own has limited applications (my mom said the only job you could get is being a caseworker). Grad school is hard to get into, and I feel like we should be more honest about that. Having career field experience can be extremely valuable, and it should not be undermined.

382,InquisitorLavellan,1584499489,/r/college/comments/fkibil/should_i_switch_schoolsmajors_when_im_close_to/,"Hey,

To make a long story short, fall semester this school year I failed all my classes due to a mix of serious, snowballing mental health issues along with my father having cancer. I know I should have been more proactive about taking action/reaching but I pretty much just shut down completely, I was and am so ashamed of needing help and being so pathetic, so I just kinda let things go. Most days I couldn't even get out of bed, unless it was to go to work or take my dad to appointments. Just as a note, before this I was a 3.7 student, regularly made Dean's list, tried so hard and I completely feel like I failed myself but I was just....not doing well and was just trying to survive. I haven't looked at my GPA since, I have been so scared and disappointed in myself.

This semester all my classes were dropped by admin, not me, without my approval or knowledge until after the fact, after I told them I was having surgery and would not be able to attend classes for two weeks. The thing is, I'm very close to graduation. If I had attended this semester I would have graduated this spring. I only have two more requirements to meet. The thing is, one of the classes that is MANDATORY for my one major is only offered in the spring, so if I go back I will have to wait a whole year to go back and graduate, just for that one class. 

However, after much consideration, I have decided that my two majors aren't actually things that I will pursue career wise after I graduate. I am majoring in English and History. The only reason I have not already switched schools is because I am so close to graduation, even if I m not actually going to use them. I instead have made up my mind to pursue psychology/counselling. So I have been looking into colleges for that, if I can even get in anywhere after having such a bad semester on my transcripts. I'm just wondering if I should wait the year and get my two degrees before starting on this new path. I really don't relish the thought of basically putting my whole life on hold for a year for something I'm not even going to use, but I also don't want to quit when I am SO close. I'm just at such a loss on what to do, so I thought I'd reach out and see what others thought.

384,Encrypted_Heart,1583120448,/r/college/comments/fc61kg/im_self_destructing/,"Cross posting to try to find an answer.

Hey guys. I'm posting this as I sit in my bed crying. I am completely out of ideas and completely hopeless.

In middle school I got a 4.0 GPA. I was in advanced classes and I was the teacher's pet and I did all sorts of extracurricular activities. I found my friends in middle school and I did really well. I procrastinated a bit but not much.

In high school I earned a 3.75 GPA. I procrastinated chronically but I always got things in on time even if it meant pulling three all nighters in a row (I do *not* recommend this). I always started things last second and turned them in right as I finished them at the latest possible moment. As time went on, this habit got worse and worse until I was emailing my teachers begging for an extension on my projects. I'm a teacher's pet, I'm extremely good at communicating, and I'm pretty convincing. These things all led to my teachers usually allowing me extra time to turn things in. And when I got my work in, it was exceptional and above and beyond expectations. I overacheived to compensate for my lateness. By my senior year it was pretty bad and I started not asking for extensions because I was so afraid to ask for too many. I did not want to risk coming across as lying or lazy. But it didn't ruin my GPA because I had a 4.0 all the way until junior year and I got decent grades in my junior year.

My freshman year of college left me with an abysmal 2.75 GPA. I didn't ask for extensions anymore because by then I became unable to get things turned in even if I had a large extension. I became incredibly depressed and nihilistic during my freshman year. I never left my dorm and all I did was sleep and watch YouTube to distract myself from the pain in my heart. Many a night saw me sobbing into my pillow and wishing I could just die. I failed my English class because I was so afraid of the final paper that I never even touched it.

My first semester of my sophomore year went pretty much the same way. I retook English and did extremely well up until the final paper, where I got farther along than last year but eventually became too terrified of it to continue, and I failed the class again. I had to pursue medical hardship withdrawal from philosophy because I missed so much class due to being so depressed and hopeless that I could never make it to class. I was surprisingly happy for the first half of that semester. I just detached myself from the pain I felt over not being able to do anything right. It caught up with me when finals week came along and I couldn't do anything to save my grades anymore. I got a 1.67 GPA.

I'm now in my second semester of my sophomore year. I'm on academic probation, which just means I have to meet with my academic advisor every other week and I'm not allowed to get more than one grade below a C. Unfortunately my advisor is extremely unhelpful and sometimes actually harmful. She has advised me incorrectly many times now. She doesn't really understand me either. I told myself this semester would be different. But then again, I also told myself that before every other semester. I'm about 8 weeks in and it's time for midterms. I've missed countless classes and I have done absolutely none of my work.

I'm going to fail again. I have a phobia of my work that neither I nor anyone else in this entire earth seems to understand. I have a job in IT (my major is CIS) and I do perfectly well in that job. I have no issues getting things done on time and I have kept the job for over a year now. One would think that how you do in school is predictive of how you will do in the ""real world"", but clearly that's not true in my case. I am not stupid. I got very high SAT scores and I have a great scholarship. As I hope you can tell from this post, I am also not bad at writing. That is why it pains me so much to fail classes like English and get such a low GPA. All I want to do is learn. I love to learn more than anything. My issues are not due not wanting to learn.

My college is unbelievably expensive and my parents are only paying for part of it (that is, if I graduate). The pressure from this is incredibly hard to bear the weight of. My parents don't understand me and only make me feel more worthless when I say anything about my schoolwork to them so I end up having to hide everything until it finally comes out at the end of the year that ""surprise, your daughter is a complete failure again!"".

To make matters worse, I have medical problems that make life even harder (IBS, hemochromatosis, chronic migraines, and narcolepsy). When I start to do well, I am punched down by one of these issues and it takes me a while to get back up again so I miss things while I'm down that make my grades drop all over again.

I have pursued medical treatment for all of my issues. I have gone through many counselors, none of which could help me. I have tried  (and am continuing to try) many medications for my mental health (I have severe ADHD and social anxiety). 

I'm in an endless cycle. I feel like I just want to curl up into a ball and cry forever. No one understands me, no one can help me. It feels like I've been given everything (intelligence, a somewhat wealthy family that loves me, and people who want to help me) but I can do nothing with what has been given to me. I wish I could just ""take one step at a time"" or ""be less hard on"" myself. I wish I could believe that ""everything's gonna be okay"". But I can't. I am useless and self destructive. I have no where to turn. I have tried everything I know of. I am so alone and so angry at myself that I hate myself more than anything in this earth.

Is there anyone who has been in a similar situation? Is there anything else I can try?",college,I'm self destructing,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/fc61kg/im_self_destructing/,1583138448.0

I somehow didn't inherit their intelligence but I went to a competitive high school and was able to pull off a decent ACT score and get into BU (after my parents proofread everything on my common app). But now here I am, a sophomore STEM major, and I don't really think I can handle it. My GPA is just hovering right around a 3.0 and I don't want to give up on my classes. But I keep getting Ds in classes everyone says are the easier ones and I just feel like I really can't do it. Some people have to be weeded out. The issue is that if I tried to switch now there's no way I'd be able to graduate in two years like I planned and I can't afford to go here longer than I have to. I'm not a hard worker but my major is decently interesting and there's no other major I'd rather do here anyway. I've also lived in the Boston area for my entire life and most of my friends and family live here or pretty nearby, but none of my family is from here and I deeply feel like an outsider. I'm dying to move somewhere else, but I have no idea how I'd afford it or where I'd go because I have no idea what career I want or could get after college (I'm not premed). I barely know anyone who lives in other cities so I'm terrified of being lonely and I have no experience with moving, but I just feel like I'm deeply not a New Englander. Honestly I don't really have much faith in getting a job after college. BU seems to be decently hard to get a good GPA, but still. I feel like it's hard to compete with people who have a better GPA. Also, my younger sister has dyslexia and my family might move so we can afford for her to go to private school. I know I'm so immature and selfish to be sad about this and this is what she needs, but secretly I've been fearing it so much since I've lived in the same town for almost my whole life and a lot of my best friends are still from my high school and it'd be hard to see them much again (I go home for breaks). I'm also in my first relationship and my boyfriend is way more into it than me which really freaks me out, but I can't bring myself to end it even if honestly some of the reason I'm still dating him is just to finally have a boyfriend and not be my stupid self people have looked down on my whole life (I do like him in the ways I should to some extent, which complicates things further). I'm worried long term I'll never be able to commit to someone and legitimately want to spend all my time with them more than anyone else since I like hanging out with a group of friends the most, but at the same time I want to get married and not be alone my whole life. I'm doing way too much stuff- balancing schoolwork with three clubs (no leadership), exercise, a volunteer position, an on campus job I can choose my hours for, trying to apply for summer internships I likely won't get, my relationship, seeing a bunch of friends that aren't all friends with each other, and still seeing my family semi-regularly/helping with my ten year old sister since I'm not very far from home. And I have terrible time management skills so I waste half the day away when it's incredibly important. I know I need to quit something, but there's nothing I can really quit. Here it is, almost 2 AM, I'm trying to make up the hours I said I did for my job last week, I flaked on my boyfriend today, and I have an 8AM chem lab tomorrow I haven't done the prelab for or last week's postlab. I just failed my orgo exam I crammed for and I'll have to lie to all my smart friends in the class as usual so they don't know how stupid I really am. I don't even know what I'll tell my parents. The worst part is that I know these are all such first world problems and I was given so much opportunity that I don't deserve when a lot of people don't get to go to college (I sound like such a shitty person in this but I really do care about other people and I see myself as worse than the average person), and I'm going to throw this expensive tuition away my parents are killing themselves to pay for away and never get a job and live with them until they die and then who even knows. I might seem like I have low self esteem, but I think I have reason to. I was born without any real talents in an area of success and I don't belong here at all. I don't know what to do. I'm sorry for going on and on and this is probably normal for a 19 year old to be unsure of their future, but I just feel like I'll be a total failure (you can probably tell by now interviews aren't going to save me). If anyone has any idea of how I could possibly turn any aspect of my life around, that would be much appreciated.

Let me tell you about my college experience so far. My first two years of college I attended at a small community school. The classroom sizes were small and the major I was studying was fine arts/visual communication. I loved it there. I made a small group of friends while I was there and everyone was really nice. I had a GPA of  3.5 when I let that school. Then I transferred to the school I’m attending at right now. I also changed my major and I changed it to psychology. I changed it, because I was feeling burned out with art. I still love art, but I wanted to try something new. So far I love psych and I’m looking to go into forensic psych. The problem is I’m not happy we’re I’m at. I tried making friends on campus. I joined a few clubs to get myself out there and I’ve had no luck. I’m alone all the time and my bf and I go to the same school as well. We hangout a lot. Don’t get me wrong I love my bf, but I would like to make some friends of my own. I feel like the classroom sizes are really big too. There are over a hundred kids in most of my classes. I feel like I don’t really fit in anywhere. When I was in high school I felt like I could make friends pretty easily and at my old work I made a bunch of friends there as well. I haven’t been making the best grades while I’ve been here. I was making As and Bs now to Cs and Ds. I go home every weekend, because I’ve been feeling pretty home stick. Also my job is back at home too. I tried getting a job were my school is at, but it’s in a small town. Jobs are hard to come by. I feel so sad and depressed while I’ve been here. I haven’t been this sad in such a long time. I really wanna get a degree in psych. I thought about taking a gap year then going back to school at the University that I’m at right now. I also thought about going back to the community college I use to attend. I also thought about going transferring to another college that is closer to my house. I don’t know what to do. I was so excited to go to this school and I’m having the worst time since I’ve been here. I feel like a failure. What should I do?

391,daybydaydoingmybest,1581465596,/r/college/comments/f2hpzx/college_is_making_me_feel_worthless/,"Okay so I feel like a total failure.

The trope is typical: I was a really smart, extroverted and charismatic kid and teen. Teachers loved me, always great grades, kinda studied but never too much. People were always complimenting my achievements, seeked me for help with homework and tests, you know the drill.



Then college came around in march and oh boy was it a shock. Life got HARD, suddenly I was not that special or good at anything at all. I had to start studying and applying myself for real this time, and falling from that high was hard. The first exam I failed had me in tears for a few days. But I pulled through. A friend and I would always go to the library together and pull long study sessions and help eachother out. It was super nice and helpful, and it was the thing that helped me adapt. 



But relying on one person is never a good idea. She suddenly stopped talking to me. Actually, she talks to me as if we were not close, as if I'm bothering her. Never wants to meet up to study or just hang out. Is always annoyed or angry at anything I say and I don't know what happened, and she won't talk to me. We got super close and now I feel I don't have anyone to talk to in the same way. I just feel super alone. She is always with this other friend of ours, and I honestly feel replaced. It's not even jealousy, I'm just hurt. Instead of having us both as friends, they got really close as we used to be, and she pushed me away. She is also taking her to our spots, our special tables, our coffee shop, our favourite park... It just hurts a lot. I know I don't ""own"" those places but it's just weird thinking of going there with someone else.



Loosing that closeness really hit me mentally, I'm an extrovert, I really rely on my friends and even though I do have more people, I'm not as comfortable with anyone else to that degree. Life in general has also being hard and it sucks that when I tried to talk to her about it, she shrugged it off, called me dramatic and to ""man up"", and that she is the one dealing with the real shit. I'm not denying she is going through a hard time herself, but I don't think you can compare struggles that easily. An example would be that she is always telling me how lucky I am that my family has money and I don't have to work yet, but on the flip side, I have a lot of issues with rejection and violence with my family, and her parents are both sweethearts. I'm not saying I have it harder than her, just that it's different types of having it hard. Whatever.



The thing is, my study routine also got totally off the hook. I truly needed her to be accountable and able to get out of bed and go do shit. I had this really important exam tomorrow, and I'm not going to show up. It's shameful how little I actually got to study. I think my younger self would be so disappointed in me. All the people that have high expectations will be crushed. And all the people who wanted to see me fail will be right.



 I never realised how hard it is to do things when no one is there to congratulate or reprimand you when you succeed or fail. It's just so much easier to never get out of bed and just lurk around. No one worrying about you. It's summer, right now we're in am exam period before the school year starts and I decided I wanted to pass one of my pending subjects (a really hard one). It's the only one I was going to attempt and I didn't even get to the point of actually showing up. I'm so disappointed in myself.  For now, it's just one subject but I really don't know how to get back on track. March is coming, and with it the begging of classes, and I am utterly terrified of what's going to happen.

392,fierce_firefly,1580584417,/r/college/comments/exb0l7/need_advice_my_poor_english_speaking_and_writing/,"I immigrated to the US about four years ago and I am 21 years old now. I was so naive at that time, and I had a misconception that I would be fluent in English right after coming to the US. But I was wrong and what I would expect actually never happened. I went and graduated from one of the high schools in the US in one and a half years to finish all the course requirements to graduate. I was so afraid that I would not get accepted into any college because of my low GPA, so I studied hard in high school. I spent almost all my time to study for the SAT and other classes I took during the semester. Apparently, my fear consumed me and I was so stressed out all the time about grades. I regularly checked on my grades and it gave me so much anxiety when I didn't get perfect scores on the particular section because I need to make A's on every class I took to bring up my 3.0 GPA. 

I was too ambitious and focus too much on grades and goals, and I didn't realize it actually destroyed my life. By the time I graduated from high school, I succeeded to make all A's, even make 100 on most of the classes, and boost my GPA to 3.5, but I didn't make a long last friendship with anyone. I sometimes get in touch with two of my old high school friends by texting, but that's about it we never really hangout. I regretted spent most of my time just study and I even didn't do that well on the SAT. I only got 1060 out of 1600. I didn't really do much in my first Summer, I only studied to prepare for the SAT and watched movies or played video games in my free time. During my second summer, I started work part-time at a restaurant to gain experience and money, I was a front desk and I messed up so many orders and took me so long when taking order from customers because of my English and also my poor communication skills. I was so useless at that time and I didn't know what to do anymore. 

I started my first year at college immediately right after high school. Then, I found another part-time job that is more flexible with my schedule, so I quitted my part-time job at the restaurant. Again, I made the same stupid mistakes and I am even still regretting as I'm writing this post. My perfectionist is killing me. I was so scared that what happened in high school reoccur in college. In my first semester at college, I didn't know what I want to major in and I would like to transfer to another prestigious school in-state I live in, so I decided to take five general education classes, including Calc 1. I was too dumb and focused too much on grades again. I didn't have that much fun and only cares about my goals. My goals at that time were to get an internship/co-op during my second year, graduate as soon as possible, and get a good job that pays well. I was so scared to interact with anyone at that time because I was not confident with my English, I always have fear of what would happen if they don't understand, what if they look me down, what if I'm not good enough, what if they laugh at me, what if... I was such a stupid nerd and didn't make a lot of friends in my first semester because of social anxiety. Apparently what people said about speaking a different language will change your personality is definitely true. I was definitely more confident in the past and surrounded by a lot of people. This semester, I worked part-time at a juice company only at the weekend and I was glad my boss let me work there because I only work roughly 8 hours per week. When my first semester ended, I only made one friend and a few acquaintances and achieved my 4.0 GPA. 

I decided to stay at the same university and majoring in Industrial Engineering in my second semester. I actually wasn't sure what I want to major in, but Industrial Engineering seems a good fit for me because I heard a lot of good things about it. I took 17 credit hours this semester and managed to keep my 4.0, but again I was too focused on grades. This second semester, I joined a club to improve my communication skills and turned out I met someone who becomes one of my best friends now. I was actually joined this club because I was rejected from a job interview for a position at college and the interviewer told me I was not engaging on-campus enough. 

During my second year, I was still focused on grades because I would like to secure a co-op/internship position to gain real-world experiences. I was also more involved on campus during my third semester as I volunteered as a peer leader for one of the freshman seminar classes to help first-year students success by connecting peers with opportunities and events on campus and help students bridge the gap between the curricular (in-class) and co-curricular (out-of-class) for a more cohesive and meaningful education. I also worked as a student assistant. I took 14 credit hours in my third semester and 16 credit hours in my fourth semester and managed to keep my 4.0. I think the reason I still have 4.0 because I am a hardworking person who avoids procrastinating and trying to get ahead of everything and with the help from an ESL professor who is constantly reviewing my paper and essays. One of my biggest regrets is I was focused too much on grades and I didn't intend to use all the assignments or tests as one of the ways to improve my communication and writing skills. I often depend on my ESL prof. to help me review my essay and my writing skills don't improve significantly. During this second year, I was offered an internship as an estimator intern, one of my responsibilities is to analyze the mechanical and electrical drawings and figure out things we can quote for our clients. I was also supposed to answer any incoming calls if needed, but I was so scared that I couldn't pick up the phone. I was not confident at all, I feel useless, I don't know how to write or speak well. My life is so miserable and tearing apart because of this. I often beat myself up for not doing enough in the last two years at college. 

Now, I am in the fifth semester and taking 18 credit hours and working part-time as a student assistant. I feel so useless the fact I have 4.0 but not capable of doing what I'm supposed to be doing at the workplace. Even to write 3-5 pages paper took me forever which in contrast only took 4-5 hours for others to finish. I also still need to ask my ESL prof. a favor to help me to review it. I feel useless and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm a junior at college, has a 4.0 GPA, but not capable to write or speak well. I have tried to apply for another internship or co-op for this Summer, but I feel my English speaking and writing skills continue to hold me back to afford one. I literally had a phone call interview (informal one) with a recruiter two weeks ago and they decided not to move forward with me. I believe it's because of my inability to answer the question properly. I don't know anymore. I wish English is my first language and I don't need to work this hard and still not able to do well. I feel all my hard work is in vain and destroyed by communication and writing abilities. I am so scared of unable to find a job right out of college. I really need to find a way to overcome this. 

In case some of you wondering why I don't try to communicate this with my family, the answer is I don't really get along with my family. They don't understand what I have been through and even my older brother didn't bother to help me out to overcome my challenges.

393,OllieChem-Chem,1580507151,/r/college/comments/ewvjve/what_was_it_like_getting_your_first_b/,"So, not to sound boastful or anything, but, ever since I started school, I have been a straight-A student. My parents always threatened to punish and shame me, though, if I got a B or below so it was less of a choice and more of an ultimatum. That being said, I always did strive to get good grades because I found it fun and would compete with other students to see who could get the best grades (I never won). Going into college, I was aware of the phenomenon of the scholar student in high school becoming the struggling student in college. I never tried that hard in high school and had an easy time with my classes. Once I started college, however, I made sure to force myself to become a more invested and responsible student. I did work ahead of time, I went to tutoring, I constantly took advantage of office hours, I practiced outside of class, and always made sure to leave time for myself to relax and rest so that I would not get too stressed. That helped me maintain high A's for the last 3 semesters.

Enter this semester, though, and where I am taking PreCalc and Trig at the same time. Both classes are made up of 4 homework assignments and 4 tests with only 4 possible points of extra-credit throughout the semester. The homework is worth 20% of the grade while the tests make up the other 80%. I just took my first test for both of those classes and it did not go so hot. For PreCalc, I barely got an, but it's an A nonetheless, so I'll take it. For Trig, though, my grade ended up dropping to a C and, now, the only way I could get an A in the class is if I got a 90 on all the other tests, which I have no faith in my ability to do.

So I've been trying to come to terms with the fact that I'll probably end this semester with my first B. I don't plan on giving up on these classes and I'll keep working hard in them, but I feel devastated knowing that I already screwed the pooch. I expected to not be able to get an A in all of my classes in college, but I thought I would at least be able to get through my AA in General Studies before this became a problem. I feel extremely dejected now and I'm starting to get scared about my upcoming math and science classes because they're harder and, by that logic, I'll probably do worse in them. This hopelessness along with my depression and anxiety is really getting to me. My mental health is already bad because I have to live with my toxic parents and this is only adding fuel to the fire.

I know this whole thing is really dumb and that I'm just overreacting over nothing. Failure is something we all have to overcome at some point in our lives. Growing up, though, I was always told to never fail because people would judge me, I would never get anywhere in life, and because I would become a nobody. My parents have also told since I was little that if I didn't have all As they would consider me a failure and kick me out and hope the next child is better (in this case my little sister). They basically did this to my older brother when they forced him into the IB program. They haven't kicked him out yet for struggling in that program, but my dad has stated that he has given up on him already and that I'm his current child of focus. Overall, I was never prepared for this type of thing, but I want to get over this hurdle in order to grow as a person. Since I've started, I've tried to better myself and I don't want it to stop just because I probably will get a B.

So what was it like for you guys to get your first B or even fail a class for the first time? Is there any advice you can give me because I know this is dumb, but I can't shake the devastation I feel. Also, sorry for the long post.",college,What was it like getting your first B?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ewvjve/what_was_it_like_getting_your_first_b/,1580525151.0

After taking general education requirements my first 3 semesters, I'm now starting to officially take the undergraduate business  courses (intro to finance, intro to MIS, management, etc), and I'm feeling really fucking underwhelmed with these classes to be honest. My intro to finance professor just starts giving us definitions and then moves onto examples without even telling us what problem we're doing next and then goes off on tangents. The rest of them just read off slides, which is honestly just super boring. In my management class, all we've done is read articles about human resources in the workplace, just a bunch of theories I could be fine reading on my own. To be completely honest, I felt way more challenged in my gen-ed requirements than in these ""business classes"" and I'm not liking this too much. I'd totally double major but that would take 5 years at this point and my scholarship only covers me for 4. We don't get any on campus recruiting from any IBs/BBs or consulting firms like MBB, which sucks for those who are interested in these fields. Going here just feels so average, and I desperately wish I could go back in time and change it all so I wouldn't be coming here.   

Reading about smaller schools like Williams, Bowdoin, Dartmouth, etc and the close relationships/experiences students have with their professors and what student life like is there honestly sounds amazing and like a freaking dream, not to mention they have all of these resources/recruiting for students to get their dream jobs. 

If I could go back to high school, I would do whatever it would have taken  to get into  a top 30 school. In high school, sure I had a high unweighted gpa of 3.8 but only took 2 AP courses even though my school offered so many, and only got a 29 on the ACT and had weak extracurriculars. I was no competitive student. I was average, and wanted to be average back then, but now I regret it so hard. I've debated transferring out but I don't have professor to give me a recommendation letter and probably would barely get any financial aid (I don't think transfers get much and my family is middle class).  I'm just stuck here, and the quality of academics/life just seems so low.

395,camohorse,1580376833,/r/college/comments/ew2uz6/well_i_dropped_out/,"You may remember me from a week ago, asking about what to do about the professor being late to the party and not answering emails. 

Well, that was red flag number one. Being the naive freshmen that I was, I thought it was normal for professors to be a couple days late. I also didn't sense trouble when in the first syllabus my prof put up, he had a lengthy paragraph explaining that he was still a student and was a new professor who has never instructed an online course before. 

But, then, two days later, after I'd submitted all of the assignments that I was told to do that week, my prof posted another syllabus, replacing the old one, explaining that he was building the course as we went along and he decided that instead of the assignments I'd already completed, we'd do something else, and get the grades for those assignments Monday morning. So, I got those assignments turned in too. 

Come Monday morning, there were no grades to be found, and then there was a third syllabus that replaced the other two. I read through it, and it was basically the same shit. New prof. Unfamiliar with the course. Try this for a change. Etc. 

I started to get really worried, and began having daily panic attacks because of the constant change in the course, and reached out to my parents and therapist asking if this was normal. My parents graduated college in the late 1990s/early 2000's. They didn't attend any online courses. So, they had no idea. My therapist, however, was a professor before she decided to use her psychology PhD to help people. My therapist told me that was very abnormal, and suggested that if things didn't improve, to drop the class. 

So, I got home, checked the course, noticed that there was a fourth syllabus posted, and decided I was done. I let my parents know what I was doing, and dropped out this afternoon, with a day to spare before refunds were cut off. 

I honestly feel like shit. I keep thinking if I just stuck with the class, I would've done just fine. The assignments weren't very hard. It was just the lack of consistency and my anxiety that got in the way. Everyone I've told about this has told me not to be so hard on myself, but I can't help it. I'm in therapy trying to bring my anxiety to heel, and develop a more positive and merciful attitude towards life and myself. But, at the moment, I feel just like a total loser. 

All of my relatives went to college. All of my friends went to college, or are in college right now. Many of those friends were/are college professors. Hell, one friend is even a dean of a medical school. Yet, here I am, 18 years old, not doing much other than working on keeping my health above water (I have Cystic Fibrosis, so that shit's kinda serious, and it turns out my anxiety is largely genetic), and I feel like garbage for not being able to keep up with a single online course in writing, which is something I'm good at and really enjoy doing. I worked so hard and tried so many things to successfully graduate high school on time, despite multiple near-death-experiences caused by CF. I did it, and I took the fall semester off with the plan of starting college after Christmas, so I could begin working towards getting my associate's degree. 

But, that obviously didn't work out. I was doing so well until now, and to say I feel defeated is an understatement. 

I know it's not a race. If it was, I'd be well ahead of the game considering my health and circumstances. But, I am extremely competitive. Everything to me is a potential competition. I'm aware that is a very toxic and detrimental mindset, and I am trying to break it. It's just extremely difficult, especially when I look around and see just how successful everyone else has been compared to myself, even though nobody else was born into suffering like I was. Thankfully, those people have tried to assure me that dropping out was the best idea, and a few of them have humorously told me they would've given me a boot to the head if I stuck with that course long enough to pay a thousand bucks to fail.

My mother, God bless her heart, works so damn hard at 62 years old and basically lives paycheck to paycheck. I've been trying so damn hard to finish my education and the past 3 years I really tried to buckle down and finish. Last semester I found out last minute that all my financial aid would be taken away because in my state (Florida) if you have too many college credits they punish you by taking your funds away and doubling the cost of your tuition.

Because of this, I had no way to purchase my textbooks or pay my rent, I was even having to resort to stealing food and going thru the garbage at fast food places to reduce my spending.

Music was literally my life, but somewhere around sophomore/junior year I started burning out. I was a pretty good player, but I started to develop a toxic attitude towards music. If I had a bad audition and didn’t make a certain band, in my mind that meant I was a shit player who didn’t deserve to make it. Obviously, this attitude led to me getting much worse at my instrument. 

I made an effort to fix my attitude, but I couldn’t help but constantly compare myself to those who were better than me, especially since it seemed like they were so effortlessly good. Playing music used to be my stress relief, but it became the main source of stress in my life. So I knew I had to quit once I got to college. 

Now I’m at a great school, but I’m kind of bored with life at the moment. I’ve tried to get involved with multiple clubs/orgs but nothing ever worked out. 

• I joined the video section of my school’s news team. I constantly forgot simple things like renting cameras, SD cards, and I was also pretty bad at making videos. It just didn’t feel right and I didn’t enjoy it at all, so I stopped going to meetings. 

• although I hated playing music, I took music theory as a gen ed last semester. I liked the class and the professor, so I tried to join my school’s music theory club. Tried going a couple times, but the doors were locked. I double checked that I had the right time/place, and I did, so after I went a couple more times and it was still locked, I just stopped trying. 

• I applied for a research position on campus, and actually got it (pretty hard to do as a freshman at my school). The professor changed his mind 2 days later saying he needed a senior. 

I want to find something to do with my free time because other than studying, I usually just watch Hulu or play video games. I’ve gotten into music production, and I plan on learning how to code, but I want to be a part of something. One thing I loved about band was the community. I still keep in touch with my friends from band, even though they all go to different schools. I want to find another “family.”

398,FUNKYDUX,1580114677,/r/college/comments/eulbig/roommate_is_going_through_really_hard_time_and/,"I'm a freshman at a relatively large school. I returned from winter break to find out that my roommate's break had gone very badly. Firstly, a close family member had been unexpectedly hospitalized and was ""on his way out."" Secondly, his girlfriend he had met first semester broke up with him as he was moving back in. When he told me this I tried my hardest to console him but I knew that he was going through some difficult stuff that ultimately he had to sort through. One night while we were studying with a group in the lounge, we decided (jokingly) that we would write all our stress-related problems up on the board (once again, this was more a joke than anything, one or two people wrote about how mad they were at teachers but it was more of a comedic suggestion). My roommate took this opportunity literally however, and took 15 minutes to write a list of problems that took up most of the whiteboard we were using. These ranged from the obvious (academic related stress, family member about to pass, break up with gf) to stuff we had never heard of (chronic bullying in high school, difficulty with home life, ect.). Of course everyone expressed their concern and sympathy, but he seemed to react indifferently. Later, I talked to him about maybe visiting the school's counseling center to receive professional mental health counseling, and offered my assistance if he needed help doing so, which he said he might consider. 

After a few weeks, a few notable concerning things happened. The first occurred when we were talking with a group of mutual friends. The subject of fights in high school came up, to which my roommate had said ""I've never been in a fight, but there are a few people I'd like to see 6 feet under."" When asked if he was actually saying what we all thought he was saying, he responded with ""Maybe. I've got a few knives."" (referencing the small collection of multi-tool knives he had in the dorm \[none of which really seemed beefy enough to actually fatally harm anyone\]). When talking to him about this later, he said that he had meant his bullies from high school, and that he never meant to give the impression that he'd hurt anyone from college. Nonetheless the comment came across as pretty disturbing. Once again I pressed him to visit a counselor so he'd have a better input for his difficult thoughts.

A few days later we were once again in the lounge in our dorm. A few female friends jokingly began dragging him out of the room because he refused to turn his music down. At first, he went along with it, but as soon as he reached the door he violently started kicking and punching. One of the girls got kicked pretty hard, and the other one got scratched by a pencil he was holding. When they backed away and everyone had a chance to ask ""what the fuck, dude?"", he looked extremely angry and distressed and said, ""That's what happens when you fuck with me, you get stabbed."" He left the room immediately after. Everyone in the room knew about the problems he was going through, but were still pretty scared and uncomfortable with the whole situation. Once I got back to the dorm, I confronted him and said that his behavior was unacceptable, and he was starting to scare me and the people around him. I then asked him if he felt bad that he hurt someone who really cared for him (If he had said no, I would have gone immediately to our RA). He said yes, and started getting emotional. He then told me that all the trouble he was facing now had made it hard to cope with some difficult issues from his past (i.e. the bullying at school as well as at home) and how he was feeling more frustrated and violent because of it. He really opened up and seemed sad and scared, and we had a good hour long talk about it. At the end, I told him that it seemed like he had a lot to talk about, and that the best way to express it would be (you guessed it) a mental health professional. This time he seemed more open to the idea, but was still not 100% on board. He ended up going back to the lounge and apologizing, sincerely, to both people he hurt. 

Now I'm left with two options. A, I can report him to my RA, or B, I can keep waiting for him to figure it out himself. Although I'm nervous about some of the comments and actions he's made, I feel like he's not the type of kid who'd ever seriously hurt anyone. He has to be one of the most unconditionally friendly kids I've ever met, and he offers his help to almost everyone he sees. On top of this, I don't want him to have to return to a place he has such bad memories of, especially not as ""that crazy kid who got kicked out of college."" I don't want to put anyone in danger by allowing someone who's in such a bad state to continue living unsupervised, but I also don't want to prematurely label him as someone who can'e be helped.

I had AP classes throughout highschool, but only took test for 4, the APUSH, which I got a 5 on, the AP English, which I got a 4 on, The AP BC Calculus, which I got a 2 on with a subscore of 3 for the AB test (so I failed the main one but just passed the part of the test that was graded on AB content, which didn't include series and sequences and polar functions), and a 2 in the AP chem test. Technically, I did get the best scores in my grade on the calculus and chem, because I was the only one in my graduating class who took them that year. Needless to say the teachers for those classes didn't prepare as well for just one kid. 

My point is, I worked hard in high school and I thought I did pretty okay. I got into a nice school and at like 20% of the cost. I went for physics, and had a pretty good first semester, a couple A's, a few B's, and a D, in my one physics course. I had a 3.2 gpa I think

Then it started to go downhill. There was a whole mix of problems, my home life with an alcoholic, my lack of interest in my major, constant personal money issues that I had to work two part time jobs over for a while, and ultimately my gf breaking up with me during finals of my second semester. My second semester I got a B in one class, a C in another, then all F's. My third semester I got all F's, didn't show up to a single final. Eventually I just stopped coming to classes. 


Here's a bit of back story about my mental state at the time and the impact it had on my performance in school, skip this paragraph to get to my question:

My mental state at the time was wrecked. A bit on my situation, I grew up from 10 years old until I moved out with an verbally and sometimes physically abusive step dad, who isolated me emotionally from my family, and my mother who had let it go on so long I didn't really trust or love her anymore. I had no love in the world except my girlfriend at the time, who I dated for a year and a half. Still, I wanted a family connection, so much went to live with my dad, who made more than enough money to pay the remainder of my tuition ($15k at a $60k school), but was a mean, vindictive, and mentally unstable alcoholic. I knew he was bad, I lived with him on weekends before, but living in the same house permanently was hell. He drunkenly accused me of taking his pain meds during my first semester mid terms. He called me vile names I won't type out. Anyways, he was as bad as my stepfather, I was crushed and depressed. Eventually, my girlfriend broke up with me. It was my fault, I had cheated on her at some point early in our relationship, and then lied a lot after that about partying. I loved her, I really did, cheating on her was a disgusting thing I did in a drunken blackout that I just can't live with myself for doing.She stayed with me for a year after that, I didn't cheat again, but she didn't want me out partying, and even tho I didn't often, every once in a while I'd sneak off and lie. Eventually sheeft and that was it, I had no contact with her anymore and when I tried to establish a friendship I could feel her lack of love or care towards what I had to say. Watching her face light up when I talked about something was the one thing of any worth I had left and I really didn't realize how bad depression could be until she was gone. I went into my third semester destroyed and unmotivated, and I just stopped showing up, got literal straight F's.  I spent the entirety of 2019 on academic suspension, getting high and working odd jobs. 



Anyways, my question is, will college's give a fuck. If I have high school scores from 2016-2017 that show I'm not a fuck up, will they give my troubles any merit, or will they just see the two awful semesters and turn me down?I want to apply to film school, even if everything was emotionally fine with me I still would have not liked physics, it was just work I wasn't interested in doing, not so much that it was hard and I struggled. But I've also had a passion for film and have recently been writing a screenplay and exploring photography. I even have an A in an intro to film class from my college first semester, which may be my best evidence of being able to do well in a film corriculum. 

My goal for now is to apply to a school I could get at like $10-$15k a year, which I think I could do for a lot of SUNY schools, I'm back living with my mom and her husband, who make less than $90k a year combined, my mom is actually unemployed, so I'd probably get a lot of financial aid benefits. I also want to go live on campus housing, I can't take it living here anymore, even if I have to pay a lot more a year for a dorm or something I'm fine with it. I want to get my gpa back up and get to 60 credits, I have 30 now at most, then apply to a nicer school I know won't accept me now, like a school in LA or NYC (I live in upstate), if I was freshly graduating I think I may have had a decent shot, but I'll be more realistic about my situation until I get my GPA up.

since then, i’ve been paying monthly on my tuition balance (ended up having to pay all of the money back from financial aid) and saving up to return to school. i have adhd and i’m a huge self-sufficiency person, so i hadn’t taken any prescribed medications for it since i was a child, but i recently started taking my medicine in around september and i’ve seen a huge improvement in my productivity and focus. i feel like i’ve never been more prepped to go back into school and kill it. only issue, i still have no idea how to study. any advice for me on learning how to study? i also have to work my job as a server and bartender in order to pay for my school. i’m currently a full time employee; hoping to go down to part time once i’m back but if i have to work full time to afford it i’ll have to. any advice for balancing that? also any general advice for returning to school? thanks in advance, everyone!

tl;dr: tried school out for a couple years, did not do well at all. finally got my shit together and did pretty well, but ended up getting screwed by the universe and losing all of my financial aid and scholarships. finally ready to return, need tips for studying effectively, advice about balancing work and school, and general advice about going back to school.",college,need life advice for returning to school!,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/eqqq39/need_life_advice_for_returning_to_school/,1579420204.0

Our problem is the kid's girlfriend (who is supposed to live in a different dorm) lives with us. She sleeps in with him in our shared bedroom, they both use our couch and living room to play games all day, she does her homework at our dining room table, cooks in our kitchen, etc. They order food all day long and leave trash everywhere that we clean up (we have to before it stinks). He doesn't sign her in, they break all of the guest policies, and break all of the fire code. Me and my other roommate have tried talking to him about it several times and his response was always along the lines of ""We don't get in your way so just leave us be."" We escelated it to residential life. We had a 3-hour long mediation that only ended because we had to go to class. It was so long because the problematic roommate kept telling the residence director that he didnt see a problem and that ""the rules don't matter because nobody enforces them."" Because it was only a mediation, the residence director tried to make us come up with an agreement. We tried explaining that at this point, because of the tension in the room (problematic roommate and his gf won't talk to us) we thought it would be best for him to be moved to a vacant room and for us to get a new roommate. Residence Director said that was not possible. Time ran out and no agreement was made other than the RD telling the problematic roommate that he needed to follow guest policy and fire code. We were not satisfied with this. I personaly went to res life to complain, they told me to talk to the RD about it. My other roommate personally went to res life, they told him the same. Then we both went to res life together, they told us the same. Eventually, we get the RD on the phone with the problematic gone (very hard, he and his gf purposely take most online classes). The RD tells us they can't move him because he pays for the room too, but to send them every instance of him breaking rules and fire code. They leave thursdays to go home and come back mondays at 4am, drop their stuff off and go to sleep. She can only stay 3 nights a week, 10 nights a month. Considering I wake up on monday with them in the bed next to me, I consider sunday to monday a night she spent there. Either way, they continued to break the rules (4 nights a week if you side with me, but definately over 10 nights a month), and they act like nothing happened but leave more trash (they even left perishable food in our fridge over winter break). We reported all of this, along with picture proof (Like res life asked) and they did absolutely NOTHING. At this point We don't know what to do. I'm not leaving my room, this was the suite I was excited to get because I got a great lottery number to pick rooms early. Also, I can't get work done at my desk because they are constantly blaring the TV next to me. Nobody talks to eachother so I don't want to speak to him to ask him to turn it down, I mentioned it in mediation and that should have been enough. Am I wrong to want him moved to another room?

405,oceaniye,1578776059,/r/college/comments/end42a/feeling_like_ive_failed_at_life/,"This is really long, and I apologize for that, but please bare with me as I am really in need of support.

I'm a 3rd year (out of 5) undergrad in biology. I began college majoring in Vocal Performance in the College of Music. I had never considered my future in terms of providing for myself or any type of financial or job security until my first semester of college and the harsh reality of it all led me to decide that I needed to explore other avenues. 

I took a semester to examine other fields of study and eventually decided on biology. My school has two different paths to take with biology, one being Molecular and Cellular, the other being Integrative, or organismal biology. Although I much prefer the MCB topics, I chose the IB route as MCB has a very strict path to follow in terms of sequence of classes and I saw pretty quickly that it would take me many years to complete the degree in that sequence with the extra foundational work I needed to get myself up to speed (I prepared myself in high school to continue with music and therefore very much lacked the math and science background I needed to begin biology) with other biology students. 

Anyway, I'm almost two years into my new major and I feel stuck and desperate. I love biology, with my whole heart. Music really was (and is) my dream but biology is my passion. I've thoroughly enjoyed most of the bio heavy classes I've taken and I know I chose the right major, but I'm not getting the grades I want nor the grades I think I deserve. 

Like most other college freshmen, I didn't know how to study. I graduated high school with a 3.85, having worked, what I thought at the time, was pretty hard. Looking back, however, I never studied but a few handful of times. Even still, I did very well. That level of work today would be earning me Fs though so I had to figure out how to be successful in college-level courses. I think I have done a pretty decent job and I've determined that on the metric of how well I feel I understand the content. I thoroughly enjoy reading my textbooks and diving deep into content, even supplemental content to help me better understand concepts at large and how they interact with each other rather than the general overview that is mostly presented in classes. By the time I am finished studying a concept, I can coherently explain pathways and mechanisms in great detail and I do so enthusiastically. When I practice, I turn to worksheets from class and sometimes problems from the text book. When studying for exams I turn to practice exams if offered and other material from class if they are not. Although I love biology and I want to learn more than just strictly the scope of the classes I'm taking, my time is very limited and grades are important so I try not to spend too much time on content beyond my classes and when practicing I focus on exercises given to me by instructors to limit any diversion away from course goals. 

Even still, I have a 3.1 GPA. I wanted to go to med school. My hardest classes are still yet to come (calc, physics 1&amp;2, 3 chem classes including orgo) and I have no background that will support me in these classes. I have been trying to practice and prepare my math skills as that is mostly where I falter, but I haven't been successful and I'm running out of time. I've taken precalc, finished with a C. I took a prepatory chem class, had a 90% in the class and a 91% exam average, then bombed the final despite studying and really understanding the content, ending with an 85%. I attempted physics last fall and after two panic attacks in the first couple weeks stemming from not being able to wrap my head around the concepts, I had to drop the class

I put everything I have into my classes, I really do, but, somehow, I can't prove it. I have ADD and bad anxiety and for these reasons I am registered with my school's disability resource department and I get testing accommodations through them. Without my accommodation I would be doing much, much worse and I can be thankful for that. I go to therapy regularly as well and I am putting in the work to better myself and become the person I want to be. Still, sometimes I have to use the portion of my accommodation that I have for anxiety because I am too anxious to leave the house or my panic surrounding an exam is so great that I cannot take it that day. Typically this is no issue and my professors are supposed to excuse me from attendance and other assignments for that day, as well as give me the opportunity to take the exam the following day, but I had a professor this last semester that absolutely would not give me that chance and due to loop hole in her course policies and syllabus, she didn't have to. I ended with a C in that class.   

I've had to start considering other options after college because I know my chances of getting into a medical school are pretty slim and quite honestly I don't think I have the room in my schedule anymore to take the supplemental classes I need  (biochem, a 2nd semester of orgo, psych, sociology) in addition to my major. 

I've been considering research, PA/NP school, and nursing school. 

PA/NP school seems unlikely being that they also require a higher GPA and supplemental classes, but mostly,  I don't think my heart is going to be in it. I've watched some YouTube videos about PA/NP school and done a little bit of looking around online and it seems that a big thing in PA/NP interview is the \*why\* you want to be a PA/NP and not a MD. Although I could maybe bullshit this, I know my heart won't be into it as much as it would be in an MD and knowing myself, it will show. 

Nursing seems like a good option but I fear that I will always feel, or at least will have to dedicate a good portion of my life to overcoming, the sense that I am living in the shadow of doctors; Why couldn't I have tried just a little harder and gotten the MD? No disrespect to other nurses, they are incredibly important, but ever since I changed my path, I dreamed of myself in other shoes. Additionally, I have really bad feet and seeing how nurses run around for hours upon hours, I don't think I could withstand the physical demand. 

And research, it just doesn't seem like anything I'm interested in, although I'm starting to feel that it is my best option. I have no background in research whatsoever outside of the lab portion of my classes. I will be looking for a lab to get into this semester as it is an important part of the curriculum for bio at my school. Again the only experience I have is in the lab for class and although I understand that they are not the same, I have hated every minute of the labs I have been forced to endure. Collecting samples is mind numbing, figuring out what tools to use and for what purpose for an experiment is honestly way above my head in difficulty and analyzing data is the absolute last thing I ever want to do. 

I took the time last semester to get my EMT license in addition to my normal classes, just because I really like medicine and I wanted a little taste of what it was like. Now, I really have a hard time accepting the idea of a future without a medical career. The notion of being presented with a problem, investigating in order to diagnose and then dividing a plan to treat, all under the premise of not only helping and supporting someone, but providing them with a better life, is exactly the piece of me that I want to give to the world. But, due to the poor metric used measure the capability and understanding of students, I don't think I ever can. Additionally, due to my poor grades, I feel that even if I do put myself into research job, I'll never make the money I need, especially not the money I want, to support myself, a partner, a family, and my mother who needs great financial help.

What can I do?

Edit: I also want to add that the idea of ""starting over"" at a community college is something I have considered but not really an option for me as I pay for school entirely unassisted by my family, through a $15,000 scholarship that ends next year and loans for all the rest. Financial security is extremely important to me and being $100,000 in debt seems to override financial security of any kind unless I somehow become a millionaire.",college,Feeling like I've failed at Life,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/end42a/feeling_like_ive_failed_at_life/,1578794059.0
406,Roger_B01,1577594112,/r/college/comments/eh1k9g/failed_general_chemistry_as_computer_science/,"Man this really sucks to fail in the most simplest Chemistry course but I had many stupid things that came up always that effected from doing good in that class. Like I find it embarrassing because I have token classes way harder like (programming 2 and Calculus 1)and passed them with excellent grade. First I was doing good in the first days in class but ridiculous things happened way after. It was mostly caused by combination of problems but it was mostly transportation. In that class I was doing my homework all the time and my lab as well. Before I explain the next part I have to tell you I live like  2 hours away from the university I go to everyday so it's tuff.  But when I took the first examination of Chemistry, I had weeks of study preparation I was prepared for the exam. But when I bored the train that I was supposed to go on never came. It turned out that schedules were messed in the MTA website in that particular day for that branch I was on. I basically had to wait 1 hour for the next train from there I got to next train but I super late to class. I only had about like 15 minutes left in the test and the test was super long so I didn't have enough time to finish answering some of the questions. I failed that test with 48%. I was not so discourage though I never failed class in my life previously than this I was saying if I keep on doing my homework and do my labs I will pass. But unlucky me had another stupid situation happened to me and that was that in that very same day I had the next second test some body in the train had heart attack the train had to stop for for almost like 30 minutes and the worst part I went in train that barely going to make it in time if it was on time. So I missed like an hour of time in the test and the worst part I wasn't so prepared for the second test because I was so busy with the other midterms I had for the other classes. I took the test and I failed that one as well and almost got every wrong. Than the night before the third test I had was massive dirrehea that I had from food poisoning of Wendy's had that night. The dirrehea was still presiting even the next morning in the the exam. I could concerted as well as I could but I had everything studied so I did the exam even with having nasty lower bowel movements.  I don't know if I ever passed that exam(I'll explained later). 

Anyways all these stupid situation is what caused me to fail this class. A lot of people don't believe me that all of this actually happened to me but it did and the only one that knows the truth is my parents and my brother.  

But what really made me angry though is not even failing the class it was the chemistry proffesor. Like this Chemistry teacher I had was treating different from the rest of the students I didn't started to noticed until like the last few weeks of general Chemistry. But long story short when I tried to ask for the results of the third exam mines she said she didn't have it. I was like saying what do you mean you don't have it? Than she to me email her for it. I did and she never responded back. I went to advisor and report her that she never gave my third exam. They sent a email to her she didn't gave me the grade with their email. I knew at this point this proffessor was taking personally with me. I guess she mad I was put actual effort and failing her test. I bet she probably threw out my test in the trash because to give grades of test doesn't take even a minute to do through email. I never seen such nasty and horrible proffessor ever before. Even the worst proffesors in other classes I had before at least gave my tests and exams back even it is zero the grade. So even after the fact I was dealing with stupid situation I had to deal with during the several tests now this asshole proffessor ruins all of my chances even to get a D. I don't know if I passed that exam because she never gave my 3rd test grade  but most likely might have because I did study hard for that specific test. 

I will most likely never get that test grade back ever. But I find it hard to believe that something like this could happen in a University. Like this is High School? No. In University I expected everything to be well documented even it is zero the test or exam. Like all the proffessor I have except her gave my grade back for everything I did even exams and test. I just can't understand University can let some asshole proffessor do this to student. Like isn't this supposed to be against policies? I seriously don't what to do because the semester of when I took that class ended.

Also another thing though is that I don't why she would be mad at me for failing her test. Like life happens sometimes I couldn't anything about what happened in those three specific days. I don't think she understands like the energy and time student puts to pass class especially a class that isn't something you're not that interested in. It take a lot of energy and sacrifice of time. Her not giving 3rd exam is because like giving like F curse word to student or equivalent because that show that you don't care about that student as student, and also showing that you wanted that student to fail. I'm just really mad because like I don't know if she was intentionally trying to fail me as well. Because I had the experience in the passed with other proffessor but I always had evidence to back my claims up. This proffessor basically made sure I was going to fail because didn't gave my third test back. And now I can't know if she did something wrong in the grading or the failing was intentional. 

All I know is that I'm not going to general chemistry until like the very last semester of university and I will take it with another proffessor. Because the amount of sufferment and sacarfice I did was no joke.

1. Keep the F on my transcript, change my major to Finance and move on, make great grades for the rest of my career...which I am capable of. Im very intelligent... 30 ACT....biology is just NOT for me....ive grown to hate it fully
2. (This is what my parents want me to do, I find it absolutely ridiculous) Withdraw from all my Finance classes that I've already scheduled and retake this 4 credit biology course alone. Meaning I would be taking 1 class in 1 semester. I find this a gigantic waste of time, I don't think that one F will hinder me so severely as they say.

I’m in my 6th (and last) year of university and approaching my Master thesis. I am still not entirely sure what I want to do and where I want to work. It puts a lot of pressure on me that I have to start applying for jobs next month already. To me, it feels like this is just hitting me all of a sudden. Suddenly I have to become a “real adult” with huge responsibilities and go back to life similar to high school again. Having to wake up early, a day schedule similar to school, and nothing but stress and pressure. I do not look forward to those things. 

I’ve always hated getting up early, since I am more of a night person. I can focus better at night and get my best ideas at that time, but I am not a morning person at all. For this reason, I write my uni papers and projects at night most of the time. I never got used to getting up early in school for 12 years, so I don’t think I will get used to it now. I tried to be a morning person (really, I tried), but it just doesn’t work. No matter what I do, I still cannot focus properly in the morning and my brain remains in sleep mode until at least 11 am. In college, I even considered 11 am my early classes. However, it  it's impossible to get a job when you're not a morning person. Almost every job is 9 to 5 and designed for morning people. Also, I find it hard to concentrate for multiple hours straight. I'm used to taking breaks after studying for half an hour or an hour. I don't know how I will handle this in the workplace.

With my degree, I have a lot of career possibilities and it is pretty versatile. I’m also pretty much open for everything. But this whole uncertainty is scary. 

Also, I love being a student and I’m not looking forward to the difficulties that come with work life. I’m worried that I may not be dealing well with the stress, especially since I am already struggling now), . I am scared of the “safety” of college/university going away if you know what I mean. I love college life and I don't want it to end. I'm scared that I may not be able to cope with the stress at work, since everybody tells me it's going to be 100 times worse than university stress. Even now, I'm struggling. How will I handle it in the workplace?

411,80sGamerGirl,1576739188,/r/college/comments/ecpqju/advice_requested_how_to_return_to_college_after/,"Thought about using a throwaway for this but screw it. I’ve tried to try to keep this concise but I am a verbose writer. Still, if any clarification is needed, I’ll answer and edit the post if needed. 

TLDR: Depression, general life, and my inability to cope with it all wrecked my college career. I was suspended after my 8th semester (out of 10, since I was doing a double major). It’s been a year and a half now, and I’m about to attend community college to try getting my feet wet again and help my GPA. I don’t want to stay at a community college long, but I don’t know how much it’ll help my GPA. Is it at all possible to transfer to a university a GPA below 2.0, or would I need to wait? What about doing an associates? Any advice on how to hold myself upright this time around?

Background: I’ve had depression since I was about 11. My mental health worsened in high school and I got on medication when I was 16. About a year and a half later, I graduated from high school. I wasn’t top of my class, but I did do well (despite rough patches and honestly sometimes not even trying that hard), and I like to think I had good prospects. I had vague plans to go as far as grad school. I started at SUNY Binghamton in fall 2014. My first semester was alright for about a month...and then I ran out of medication. I wound up being off of it for a month and that wrecked me. Even after I obtained it again, I wasn’t able to catch up, and I had to medically withdraw for the semester. 

Spring semester was still rough and I only passed half of my classes, so I had to go into fall on probation. That summer, my parents split up and that was a mess to grapple with. The 2015-2016 school year had difficult spots, but I was able to make myself catch up on my work when needed, and I passed ALL of my classes--even made the dean’s list that fall while on probation! Sweet victories. 

At this point, my GPA was 2.67 going into fall 2016. And then, I don’t know what happened. Maybe it’s because I was suddenly taking 3 upper level courses at once and having to deal with family shit (being an intermediary for my parents who needed to communicate but only wanted trickles of information to flow through me) and trying to figure out my own mental health and grappling with other personal issues. I fell behind on work and took Incompletes in my courses so that I could catch up over winter break. Then I pushed them into spring...while already taking a maxed out semester course load. I made stupid choices thinking I could do it all. Then the Incompletes got pushed further and further forward while my life continued to crumble around me. My mental state looked brighter later in the semester, but it wasn’t enough. Surprise surprise, I wasn’t able to catch up on all that work, and all the Incompletes I had accumulated turned into F’s. And there went my GPA. Down to 1.52. Thus came suspension after spring 2018. 

I decided to move to Texas to live with my dad and step-family so I could try getting on my feet with the support of my dad and his resources. He pushed me to get a job so I’d have something to do with my time, so I’ve been working at a grocery store since early this year. I have had vague, on and off plans about how to move forward--getting my drivers license and a car, planning for school, staying on top of self care, returning to therapy.

Thing is...I’ve been stagnating. Self care is hard as fuck, and I have zero discipline to stick to anything that actually helps me, instead losing focus and just ignoring everything around me. My head often feels foggy; I feel like my sense of time is wonky, and I lose focus and get distracted and disinterested even with things I’m doing for fun. I feel restless and I don’t like where I am, but I can barely bring myself to do anything about it. I’m frozen in place by fear of the unknown and anxiety about what will happen. I’m scared that I’ll just fail again and waste even more money and time and continue to feel like an utter failure. 

Current Plan: I took on too much before. I was drowning, but I told myself that I could breathe underwater. I’m trying to be realistic now. I’m trying to resist the impatient and ambitious part of me that wants to DO ALL THE THINGS and do them NOW. I plan on focusing on just finishing a single major and getting my bachelors degree (History). Maybe I’ll do a minor if I can swing it. I hope that starting somewhere new will help as well since I won’t have as much baggage. 

I’m enrolling in a local community college for this spring to take a class or two, but I don’t think that will push my GPA above 2.0 after one semester. However, there is only so much I can do at a community college at this point since I’ve got a lot of my general education requirements out of the way already, and so I would prefer to transfer to a university soon (preferably back in New York since I don’t want to stay in Texas). Alternatively, maybe I could do an associates, and then transfer to a university with that on my transcript? This is terrain that no one I know has charted, so I don’t know how some of these things work. I’ve tried looking through reddit but haven’t found anything specific to my needs, of course.

Questions: 
1. Is it possible to transfer to a university with a cumulative GPA below 2.0 but recent coursework showing improvement? (In general; I know every school is different)
2. When transferring to a new university, how are credits and GPA applied? Are only grades above F accepted, and it’s effectively like the fails never happened to your gpa?
3. If I can’t transfer to a university yet, would it be best to take more classes at a CC until my GPA improves, or get an associates and then go for a bachelors?",college,Advice Requested: How to Return to College after Flunking out,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ecpqju/advice_requested_how_to_return_to_college_after/,1576757188.0
412,nanotech23,1576441910,/r/college/comments/eb47x1/i_hate_myself_am_mad_at_being_lazy_crazy_and_i/,"The last 4 years i was a neckbeard dropout. I dropped out because i knew by the then last semester that my mental health was awful and attending class was too stressful for me because i couldn't pay attention in class and couldn't be motivated to be consistently hard working and on task. 

by then i tried every adhd treatment and nothing really changed things without making the stress and anxiety in my life, which was already very bad, even worse. 

so i dropped out and in the 4 years i very aggressively worked with a psych trying literally everything you can take for GAD, depression, OCD, and ADHD all together. Because despite my track record, i do have goals and dreams i want to achieve. 

Nothing really changed my nature - which is having distracting thoughts and anger and emotional instability and no willingness to leave my mom's apartment - but my parents, my dad especially, kept on pestering me to go back to school. i knew i still wasn't ready but i also felt it had been too long since attending class that i needed to start doing something with my life again to feel better about myself. i hadn't been working either because my last job killed my self esteem because i was awful at everything and i couldn't even emotionally handle responsibility when i was working just 6 hours a week. 

This semester i have been taking 1 attendance-based class and 1 online class. The online class I am passing but the attendence class i might fail. It's an art class and i accidentally missed 1 project already (and there are only 4 projects) and this last project i can't understand the instructions even though they are written down in a handout. I have also missed a lot of class because i opted to stay home a lot because staying in my room is the only measure i can take that comforts my intense anxiety and depression and whatever else i have. when i'm outside i just hate everything and i'm constantly stressed out and exhausted that i'm not home.

So i don't know if i should even bother signing up for next semester. I'm starting to accept that i'm simply a loser, and while that isn't a productive thought, it's just starting to make sense because emotionally i am so messed up. 

like for the project that determines whether i pass or fail that i still need to do, my teacher has shown us a few videos of instructions, an in-class demonstration of the project process, and passed out a comprehensive write-up documenting the instructions of what we're trying to do, and i still have no fucking idea what i am doing. i literally can't comprehend or remember information that i want to remember, whether its written down or communicated verbally or demonstrated visually, and my problems solving skills....well, they don't exist at all. 

-------

so im at a loss at where my life turns to next because none of the medications im currently on, or have tried, work to make things different, and there are no medications left to try. the only psych medications that are left are for conditions i dont have. 

if i accept that im just an idiot loser that doesn't have the capability to even work towards my dreams, then i'll never be satisifed and i'd rather kill myself soon (as in the next few years, not right now) than see myself being in my current predicament and being 35 or 45 (im 26)",college,"I hate myself &amp; am mad at being lazy &amp; crazy, and i don't know if i should bother registering for classes next semester",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/eb47x1/i_hate_myself_am_mad_at_being_lazy_crazy_and_i/,1576459910.0

I'll try to keep it short, basically, I've always had super bad luck with college. I graduated high school 2years ago and ever since I've been trying to start but ALWAYS run into crap to prevent that from happening. I've seriously never seen the stuff I've had to happen to me, happen to anyone else, college from what I hear is hard enough, trying to get in is unbelievably frustrating. This is the 3rd school I'm trying and I can't because of a pending fee I have from the previous school.

Well, my MIL loves to talk college bc she just went back and for a short while she and I attended the same online school and thought that was the best thing ever. Well, IDK what to talk about, I've never really attended and I'm just stuck and stressed. Christmas is coming up and I know I'm going to get flooded with ""How's college? What are you doing? How is it?"" And whatever else. If anyone could tell me the basic responses to questions you get asked by family about your college life, I'd really appreciate it. And anyone taking psychology (what I'm going to major in) could you tell me what you learn you're first year studying (I'm going for associates but anything would help) and I'll read up on it, I've tried looking it up and nothing helps. I'm too ashamed to tell anyone for multiple reasons. I'd appreciate any relative advice!

414,khaleesi_onthatbeat,1576218502,/r/college/comments/ea0cd1/im_29_about_to_graduate_and_i_am_terrified_about/,"I graduated high school in 2008 in the USA. I busted my ass off then, was in all AP classes (except for math, my weakest subject. Looking back i think its because i didnt have the right kind of teachers or environment for my learning style, nor did i have the discipline and motivation or study skills at the time). 

My SATs slayed pretty well. I got into my dream school  and i pursued a design and tech degree in Theatre Arts. But the program and school I was in was more competitive than I thought, the community was toxic and superficial, i struggled living on my own, making meaningful friendships, and giving up all of my other hobbies to pursue a career in one. 

Turns out I wasnt disciplined or focused enough. I got warned and demoted from a BFA to a BA, and so had to take other required general classes that I had no interest in and was also separated and isolated from a lot of my peers. I felt ashamed. My family made sure to remind me how disappointed they were. All my scholarships and loans and hard work they put to get me into college felt wasted. I slipped into severe depression and it only got worse. I took a semester off. Which turned into dropping out completely because I felt ashamed and scared and my pride was hurt badly. 

I spent the next year living at home, working 2 part-time jobs and paying rent to stay with my parents and cover my phone and car insurance. I tried taking a couple community college courses. At the time, I felt so ashamed and like that this “demotion” was beneath me. From my perspective, only people from my high school who didnt have any direction or were high school duds went to community college. Very few of the people i knew who went there straightened themselves up to transfer to bigger schools or find a good career. A lot of them dropped out and still even now never finished or are on some path with little progression. Even some of the smartest and talented people i knew who messed up and ended up as pizza delivery guys or constantly working in temp jobs. At that time, I judged them, and felt like i didnt belong there. So i flunked community college too. 

I moved out of my home, across country, and started living on my own after some traumatic family events. I started working part-time in food service job and did just that. All i did was work and wander around my new city. I had few friends whom i rarely had time or energy to hang out with, but i did learn some new things. I learned depression management, i learned to keep my space clean and organized (the first time my parents visited me they were in disbelief at how clean my apartment was!), i began exercising again and lost all the weight i gained during college after stopping sports, and being on antidepressants and binge drinking and having poor eating habits. I taught myself how to cook and be more diverse and experimental with eating on a budget. I learned how to dress nicely and wear skirts and dresses and gained some more self-confidence. I got promoted twice until 3 years later i was in a high management position. 

After that I had an opportunity to move abroad with my work. Once my project ended, i decided to stick around and do language study for a year. I also discovered that I could attend University once i passed a certain level of language fluency, for almost 10x cheaper than in the USA. So i applied and was accepted as an international student and restarted college studies with a new major in 2014. 

I was working part time, struggling a lot to pay for school AND living expenses on my own. I experienced racism and stereotyping, neglect towards the international student body and preference towards exchange students from my school’s administration and faculty. I missed out on a lot of the “fun” parts of being a college student. I never explored or traveled around or near the country I was studying in. I had some other traumatic experiences - severe illness. I failed my first semester because i got pneumonia during final exams. I almost died the year after from a heart infection that turned out to be due to me developing an autoimmune disorder and it set me back financially and gave me a lot of stress. But, i started to pay more attention to taking care of my health, eating better, exercising more. I quit a toxic job even though it paid more. I found a lesser-paying, more physically demanding job, but it was close to home and school and my management and coworkers became my family for over 4 years. I got back into sport again. I started really exercising again and my health improved. I made more friends. Despite everything, despite my anxieties and stresses and bouts of depressive episodes, the overall quality of my life did improve a lot. 

I struggled with my grades, managing study and work and having a social life and did not successfully avoid burning myself out. Taking courses bilingually is HARD. 

I dealt with some fuckboys and fake friends and manipulative and self-centered employers. I met the love of my life and also have my own chosen family around me. I was injured and needed surgery and had to quit my team. Only recently, a year later am i becoming active again and overcoming that psychological hurdle. The people in my life who really mattered showed up and helped me through a lot and are by my side still to this day. I rediscovered my faith in God and became more religious which has helped me develop more self-love and patience, manage anxiety, and make even more new friends and discover new things about life and people. 

I finished my last lecture of undergraduate studies today. I have only one final exam and two reports due next week and it’s all finished. Come February I will be matriculating and getting that damn diploma, with a BA in Linguistics and double major in Cognitive Neuroscience and a minor in English Language and Literature. It took me 5 1/2 years to finish this degree. I am almost 8 years later than most of my peers. I have friends and family who are married, getting married and have kids and bought their own homes and even finishing masters and phDs. 

Its so hard not to compare myself. Or minimize my struggles because there are people who have it worse or didn’t even have the opportunity to get a college education. I feel ashamed to celebrate this achievement and feel like its mediocre and nothing special. have been a student and struggling to survive on a minimum wage for so many years, to imagine that I will have a job that pays me every month consistently more than enough that i need to barely survive, have health insurance, a regulated schedule, moving beyond student life...it feels unreal and its terrifying. I still have no idea if what i’m doing next is the right thing or where it will take me. I’m trying to focus on the fact that its out of my hands. I can do my best to sway towards my goals but only God knows where i’m going to go and where i’m supposed to be. I hope grad school, marriage, my own family, an established and forward progressing career, and opportunities to do good for the world are in my future. 

Sorry for the long post. But i just wanted to share. Everyone is on their own path, and their own timelines and not all people do things in the same way as people expect you to. S*** happens and life sometimes sucks a lot most of the time lol. Appreciate the good things as best as you can and focus on the lessons and realizations you can learn from the bad things. Question everything but TRY not to question yourself. (Ugh, i know, easier said than done) Usually your heart is always telling you what’s right. 

Get organized. Use a planner or calendar or whatever method helps keeps you on track of your life. Eat more protein and vegetables. Be active. Cut out toxic people from your life even if it means you have no friends at all for a while. Revisit old friendships that sizzled out. Stay in touch with your family.  It is possible to work and be in school. Part time jobs are not beneath you and teach you valuable social and work ethic skills. Change your major or do a double major or take general ed classes in things that interest you or may teach you something useful and supplementary. Manage your budget. Do things you like that aren’t harmful to you or other people. Practice empathy and kindness as much as possible. To others, and yourself.

It started bad but in the end I just barely managed to pull off a C. Summer rolled around and I took anatomy which scared me since it's hard too and I was taking it over the short summer semester.

Im happily accepted into my major's program regardless of if I finish this chem class and get credit this semester or next so that's not a concern at all. 

I was hospitalized 4 times for many times, was under general anesthesia 3 times, seen by many, places on a tricyclic antidepressants which spiraled me into radical anxiety and in the meantime am battling mysterious gastroenteritis, several peptic ulcers that as of the last week have been seen to be healing finally and symptoms that ended up getting in the way of me being successful in a challenging course. 

I'm passing all my other classes no problem, because the professors communicate, understand, and genuinely ensure that I'm not left behind as long as I still forge ahead when I'm able. However this Professor, mind you this is no flagship university at all, former community college that's now a 4-year college, no dorms nothing like that, doesn't put effort into responding to emails and has ignored 3 within 2 weeks and responded with asking me to instead talk before class when I couldn't because I would be going under for a procedure ordered by my doctor. I explained in length, which embarrasses me but has to be said for him to ascertain the situation. No response, nearing last couple weeks of semester. 

I have only been absent from his class two weeks or four total sessions to this date and once from early in the semester for a hospital stay so 5 times all I have documents for and he has 1 document for the first absence. My issue isn't me getting thr C so I can move ahead here though, it's that I'm struggling hard between a bout with mental illness and several GI issues some thst haven't even been diagnosed as biopsies from polyps in my colon are being send to check for cancer, and the fact that I'm bad at chemistry. 

I'm bad at chemistry, I'm sure I could take the exam I missed and take the final which I was not in class for a good chunk of material nor the review but I would most definitely fail the class with flying colors because of the grade scale no matter how you slice it. It has me stressed out because although my illness has kept me homebound for only this short time I've been living with it since a couple weeks before the semester and fighting it all the way. I dont want an F, and I dont want a passing grade I dont deserve, I want to be able to retake the course, next semester, without the increase in tutition for retake and maybe not show up on otherwise very good transcript? It would follow me everywhere if I had a WF or F in this important course. I want to earn the grade and am on a plan to be healthy and ready by the spring semester. 

My school has no online info about this subject, although because of an incident (student bringing a gun on campus and cocking in next to me in his jacket) two semesters ago I had an academic appeal filed and won when I had four classes (two spring two summer) dropped completely from all records because I dropped them due to weeks of victim silencing and questioning of me, the victim, and had to fight up the chain to the board of trustees to have that happen so I know the school won't be doing me any favors. Do I have to show them all my medical documents, even if i dont wish that the school sees my personal diagnosis for privacy concerns? (The counselor on campus believes that because I had a panic attack when the student had the gun that I'm cookoo and that because I pursued a security officer getting successfully fired for criminal negligence I'm a ""petty paranoid little boy).

Last fight was a nightmare, what channel should I take first as this issue will be handled these next couple days. Do I go to the provost who tried to silence the gun issue from all of my classmates via intimidation? Do I just see an advisor and tell her what's happened and see her deal? Do I bother trying to see the professor during office hours, or like I'm thinking will he just send me off to find someone else that manages this type of issue and be a way more stressful situation then needs be?

I'm not so sure what I want to major in anymore. It started as me wanting to get something in graphic design since I've always been interested in art. I was in graphic design back in high school except for my last year, where the school I moved to didn't have that class, so I chose art 2 drawing. I'm not so good at drawing. To be honest, I'm not that creative at all. I always had a really hard time coming up with designs unless it was something I wanted to do, but man did I love sitting down and making art.   
When I started ACC I put my self down for general studies, and then business management, and then I switched to Construction Management &amp; Science. I rode that wave for a couple weeks, I always thought I'd be a good manager. But I need Pre Cal and General Physics to transfer and I am not so good in math. I can sit down and do my homework and I'll learn the material within a couple hours and do okay on a test, maybe a 70 or an 80 at most, but it's not my forte. Maybe I am not studying hard enough.   
I feel so lost, I've always wanted to do something related to art, and I'm reading that the portfolio reviews are hard and only a small amount of people get in. I don't have enough money to try and then get rejected, and then be a couple of thousands short.   
I've tried multiple career finding quizzes and tests, but nothing ever appeals to me, or it involves a lot of math, I have never even taken physics in high school. I have no idea how I passed algebra!  


Can someone please help me out? How do I find what I can do? I already embarrassed my self in front of my advisor 4 times. I want to go to a four-year college and make something of my self, but I feel so lost.

420,Calligraphee,1574489795,/r/college/comments/e0e2af/advice_on_this_situation_please_grade/,"I defended my (undergraduate) senior thesis this week and I basically failed (given an indeterminate grade lower than a C- and told that I must change some things in order to pass). Okay, I understand that my project wasn't clear enough in some aspects, and I can fix that. I was aware of these shortcomings and tried to address them in my defense, although I struggle to do so due to me nerves. I met with my advisor to go over the changes I need to make in order to bring by grade up (to ""potentially a B-"") and they're incredibly simple; I have to define 3 terms and add a paragraph of background information, adding less than a page to my final paper. I feel as though this is an incredibly small amount of work for such a significant grade increase, and I don't understand why I did not pass initially if that's all I have to do. I fear that either this is not truly enough work to improve my grade or that I was graded unfairly based on my initial submission.

When I met with my advisor to debrief after my defense, she told me, ""now you *actually* have to start doing the work needed for this project."" I feel incredibly insulted and disheartened by this comment: not only did I follow her instructions to the letter throughout the entire process (yet still received no higher than a C on any assignment), I contacted foreign governments and organizations during my research and generally worked harder on this project than I ever have before. I would do exactly as she told me, meeting with her weekly to discuss my project, and she would seem very supportive and tell me I was doing a great job, but then when I would turn in the assignment, I would nearly fail. I would ask her to explain what I did wrong, but even when I would take her comments and apply them to my paper, my grades would never improve, and in fact have been slowly decreasing over the course of the semester. I'm not one of those students who feels entitled to their grade point average, but I do feel that my historic performance is a better indication of the level of work I produce than this class has been. I do plan on going to graduate school in the future and I am concerned that this grade will impact my chances of getting in. Before this class, I have never received a grade on any assignment or class below a B.

Due to guidance given to me by a senior member of the administration with whom I share a professional relationship (who has read my thesis and informed me that he agrees that I was graded very unfairly), I have decided to email the head of my department to try to discuss what's been happening. However, this professor was on my defense committee, and therefore had some say in the tentative grade I have received. This is the email I'm planning on sending:

&gt;I was wondering if we may be able to meet sometime before Thanksgiving break begins to discuss the grade given to me on the committee draft of my senior thesis. I know that I have some important changes to make, but I do not believe that the work I produced was deserving of an initial grade equivalent to lower than a C-, especially if the changes I have left to make are as straightforward as they seem. I may have done a poor job of defending myself on \[Day\] \[Note: I panicked and failed to explain some of the lengths to which I went in my data collection\], but I have worked incredibly hard on this project; however, despite closely following the instructions given to me by Professor \[Redacted\] at every step of this process, my grades in Senior Seminar are dramatically lower than in any class I have ever taken, and I am concerned that even if I make the edits as required my grade will not significantly improve. I would appreciate the chance to explain myself before you in your role as the head of the \[My\] Department to see if there are any steps that could be taken to rectify my final grade in the course. I will, of course, continue to refine my thesis as Professor \[Redacted\] has instructed. 

Is this appropriate? I know that she may be the one responsible for my non-pass, in which case I hope to learn more about what exactly I need to do to improve my grade. The grade I was told is not the absolute final grade for the assignment, which will be granted after I pass in the edited version, but since throughout this course my advisor has told me one set of instructions and then has graded me on additional, unmentioned things, I am very concerned about what will happen at this point.

I feel like I'm overreacting, but the person I spoke with was adamant that I should contact the department head for the above reasons. I just want to know if my email comes across as too whiney or entitled.

Man, that comment about needed to ""actually work"" was really disheartening. I've been pouring my heart and soul into this, and I thought that was coming across in my weekly meetings. I guess not.

Coding is like reading a foreign alien language to me. 

I was looking at graphic design, but told the market is overly saturated and job outlook is estimated to only grow 3% from 2018-2028 (I have the source but don’t know if I’m allowed to post links here).

Apparently web design/development (same thing? I don’t know) is much better pay and demand, but that requires coding, right? 

I already know I’m going to need remedial math in community college, and that’s fine, but I know some majors start with different paths.

I am closer to being ready to take the TSI, and even if I tried to major in something that wouldn’t require starting with the basics (Associate of Arts) I would need to understand advanced math from the beginning going in, which I don’t.

I am having a very hard time, not just with this, but my entire life is reliant on learning education and skills for good job prospects.

I just want to climb up and move forward, and be who I want to be and live how I want to live, not be stuck living with my parents or homeless as a hopeless virgin who doesn’t believe hard work will actually pay off and reap rewards.

I’m 24, I barely graduated high school, I can’t just wait around any longer, without getting into the horrible specifics, I’ve basically waited doing nothing sitting at home for the past 6 years. Now I just have a low paying, low skill dead end job that’s primarily for teenagers and special needs adults, (but remember, I didn’t even get to get my first job until 21) that doesn’t even pay $10 an hour or guarantee hours, and no consistency in when my shifts are.

I do not even have desire to even try to move up in the company, I absolutely hate retail/grocery jobs, I hate a lot of the customers and I hate the physical atmosphere/environment, and I don’t relate to anyone, which mostly consists of younger teenagers and elderly people who are grumpy about where they ended up in life (I rather die young than end up old and regretful and miserable).

I’m miserable everyday, but at the same time comfortable, like some contradictory paradox. I desperately want a life, but I’m also comfortable not having to starve or sleep on the street. 

I contribute a little to some small bills, (in place of actual rent) but my parents pay for the majority of everything (I also buy a lot of my own food and stuff).

I’m not comfortable with the idea of having friends or a girlfriend while living with my parents. Insecure how it looks, and fearful of my parents judgement.

I’m also working on getting my driver license because I just recently got over the fear of driving enough to seriously put effort into learning. Getting better at it, can’t be rushed though. I do have savings to buy a cheap used car when I get it though, my parents also have claimed that they will help me buy a car, but if not, I’m sure I can find a decent one for $2-$3K or less?

Maybe my next step is to go to the career counselor at the community college? I still think I may be full of uncertainty afterwards with what I want to pursue.

I know I will be put on academic probation during my spring 2020 term. Please read or skim over everything and then read my question at the end. 

I’m a biology major, but quickly learned that I’m not a science/math person at ALL. I have never been good at math and was only decent in science, and I have no idea why I thought it was a good idea for me to try to be a bio major. It was probably because of my parents pushing me to go into it. I took bio, chem, calc, and kinesiology and I had to drop bio and chem as I was already failing those classes even before October. I’m THAT bad. Science/math and me aren’t a good pair at ALL. I tried to study for it and even went to tutoring but I never could understand it. 

I have NEVER taken anything seriously and never understood the real value of money. I realized that I’m spoiled, not in the money sense, but in the way that I haven’t had to endure any real trauma or learn any hardships before, so I take everything really lightly, thinking that I can be saved by my family. I underestimated how tough college would be. I was an honors student in high school and treated college like high school. That was my mistake. No one can save me now except for myself and I’m planning to fix that next semester. I’ll be taking easy classes and will work hard. 

However, I don’t have ANY money for next semester and I’m not kidding. I’m not one of those people who say “I’m broke” but then spends $30 on Starbucks and fast food. I legitimately don’t have any money. I straight up have $0. I have EXTREMELY strict Asian parents who didn’t let me get a job in high school and they don’t allow one in college either. They get furious every time me and my sister mention getting a job, so I have no money saved up at all. I know that if you have below a 2.0 GPA, you’ll lose all of your financial aide. My financial aide covered my entire semester tuition, so now that I’m going to lose it, I can’t afford to pay for the next semester on my own. My parents have told me before that they DO have money saved up for me in college, but I would have to tell them that I’m on academic probation and they’ll know how much of a disappointment I am and I don’t want them to be stressed over me and my failures. There IS another way for me to get money but that would have to require me to ask my rich aunt for it but I would have no way to pay her back since I’m not allowed a job. 

I can’t take a term off or go to a community college because my parents would know and be SEVERELY against me doing so. They DESPISED the idea of me taking a gap year and I wasn’t allowed to take one.

I apologize if this title is an issue to anyone, but I've been struggling with it, and there's no communication from the college staff about my current state. This will be long...

I started this semester with a 2.5 GPA, this year is my last chance to bring the GPA over 3.0 so that I can have a scholarship to return next year. My second class for my degree is CS 202. This class is how you get into the next few years of study.

On the first day of this class my professor bragged about how many students have dropped his class, and I didnt know this was a sign of a bad professor. I decided to stay in the class working as hard as I can. Fast forward to our first mid term when I get a 39/100. This wasn't even the worst grade in the class. That was the class *average*.

Anyways, the next class after that, the professor spent 2 hours bombarding the people with low grades about not working hard enough, telling us we're not good at computer science so we should give up on it.

That night I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about how useless I am in this world that even with my maximum effort I can't do well in that class. I just told my self over and over again that I was okay. But it always turned around to suicide. There's nothing for me anymore. If I lose my scholarship I really have nothing left. Nobody is going to hire me. Nobody is going to want me. I'll be a failure.

The only thing keeping me from suicide is my Mom, and the family I have on the rowing team. This professor has been reported 4 times by students, and nothing has happened. I feel so defeated. This school is destroying me mentally. I've spent so much effort on this one class that I'm lowering grades in other classes.

I tried to drop this class last week, but the department chair only has time for this Tuesday. I couldn't bring myself to go to a class where I would be ridiculed by a professor again for 4 hours. I got a grade of -10 for a pop quiz, and then got an e-mail that I had failed the class due to absences. I e-mailed both the professor and the department chair about it, but nothing has happened.

I didn't have any choice, as I could only take her class when I signed up for classes, couldn't fit any other class in my schedule. Literally no one I've talked to likes her or respects her, even though she's the head of the entire Mathematics department and designed the curriculum used by every Calculus class. The first day of class she said that she failed 40% of her students every semester, and after the first week she said that she'd already decided who would fail. I have some pretty hefty mental disabilities on the side, I could list a dozen mental illnesses off the top of my head that I've been solidly diagnosed with. I'm still determined to not let these interfere with my life or slow me down though, so I got a set of disability accommodations that range from private testing areas (instead of testing in the ""testing center"" with a hundred other students) to leniency with absences. I've tried not to need to use the absence one, but this semester has hit me particularly hard with financial issues and such adding to my regular school, social, and anxious stresses. Finally, the school has a policy that states if a student has six or more absences they automatically fail, (mostly) no exception. Part of my accommodation allows for that policy to not apply.

I have missed quite a few days this semester, but I have stayed on top of my class work (we do most of our learning out of the textbook anyway, class is just work on problems in groups after a ten minute review lecture) at home and am just as capable as anyone else is. I've communicated with my professor that my absences were due to my disability and that I was willing to do any extra work required or any out of class meetings to make up for them if she wanted me to. I've done things like that in the past. However, she said that it wouldn't matter and that she was failing me anyway. She said that she'd been teaching at this school for twenty years and that there was no such thing as mental illnesses getting in the way of school, and that if I was really dedicated I wouldn't have missed classes. I've been receiving zeros on assignments that I completed, graded my tests extremely harshly (more so than my fellow classmates), if I didn't simplify even the most simple of things in my work (which would normally result in a -1) I would get the entire question wrong, even though it was the right answer. 

It's gotten so bad that I've considered trying to transfer classes halfway through the semester, seeing as all the classes follow the same curriculum it shouldn't really matter what class I take I'll be in the same place in terms of where the class is. The only problem I see is that the school would get pissy about it (they don't like granting disability accommodations at all, and only do it because they have to), and I'm not sure how they'd handle transferring my previously completed assignments.

I go to a small Liberal Arts College in the US, and I was born and raised in the US. My roommate is an international student from literally the opposite side of the globe, and this is his first time in the US. We've been in school for just over 2 months now, and some things he does has started to get on my nerves. I understand a lot of the complaints I will layout seem egregious, or even ridiculous, but I have the mindset that no I will go to great lengths not to inconvenience others and I wish to be treated in at least a similar manner. 

For example, he will often play music or watch videos from his speakers when he has not only earbuds but headphones as well. My headphones aren't great, and I can often hear whatever he is listening too unless I put my own pair on and even then it's not enough. I rarely use speakers, and only ever when the room is vacant. I do this to ensure that others in whichever room I am in, whether it's my dorm or a public location, aren't forced to listen to what I want or cover their ears. 

That entire thing is more of an irritant than anything else, and while there are a few other things he does that cause annoyance (not showering often, not cleaning his half of the room, never doing the trash etc.), I recognize that no-one is going to be perfect and there are certainly much worse behaviors a room-mate could partake in. To deal with much of this, I have begun to do the majority of my studying in vacant classrooms. Furthermore, I almost never come back to the dorm unless absolutely necessary. I'm more of an academic in the sense that I really care about my scholarly work and grades, while he has admitted to me that he really has no goal in college. This establishes that we have fundamentally different objectives in college. 

However, the activity that I have suffered from the most recently seems to cross the line in my opinion, and I'm looking for feedback as my thinking may not be entirely coherent after only 6 hours of sleep in the last 60 hours. I have issues falling asleep (no diagnosis but I reckon I could get it if I discussed it with doctor and psychologist). He has friends from his home country that he enjoys to play online games with, and voice chats with them while he plays. I have no issue with this, a matter of fact I often do myself when I have spare time and my own room (similar train of thought to playing music/videos through speakers with other people around). He does this in our dorm room, which I personally don't enjoy but can tolerate to a degree. There are two major caveats though to this; the first of those being he will play late into the night consistently. The other is that he mostly plays FPS games, and not to stereotype but he often verbally expresses his frustration and sometimes very loudly. 

Storytime (Whoever comments ""Storytime"" first I will guild as a reward for reading this far. Seriously, thank you for reading): This week I had 2 midterms. The first of them was yesterday, and the second was today. The night prior to the first, he wasn't voice chatting but was playing an FPS game. At about 11:30p I turn off the lights as per usual on weeknights, and prior to this, I let him know about my midterms and that I would need to get sleep. He plays with his back to my bed, so the screen is facing me and practically blinds me, so I have to sleep on my left side which is difficult as I am used to the right (idk why, I just am). Not a big deal in itself, but the monitor lights up the wall to my left so there is practically nothing dark in the room unless I cover myself in the blanket, which makes it harder to breathe but at least it's dark. Furthermore, he plays with KBM (Keyboard and Mouse) and while his keyboard is supposedly ""silent"", it's not even close and I can hear it clear as day even when I cover my ears with multiple pillows under the aforementioned blanket. I even had tried putting on my headphones with noise-canceling with nothing playing, and turning my fan on max for white noise and I can still hear not only that, but the rapid clicking of the mouse as well. The cherry on top being when he gets frustrated, he often will speak about as loud as if I was trying to talk to someone across a crowded lunch table. Perhaps not for you dear reader, but for me, it is impossible to sleep when someone shouts various things like ""gay little f** stop camping with the (insert weapon here)!"" or ""That's right you little s***head.""
After asking him to quiet down a little at around 1am (I had been lying in bed on my left side, my blanket and 2 pillows over my ears for an hour and a half at this point) I was miraculously able to fall asleep at around 1:30am or so and get about 5 hours of sleep, along with 15mg of Melatonin. 

Yesterday, after my first midterm, I reminded him that I have my next midterm the following day and again will be going to bed at 11:30p. This time though, in addition to everything he did the previous night, he started voice-chatting his friend and playing games at 9p or so and continued it into the night. At around 12:30a I asked him to quiet down and he said ""Ok"" (He was almost shouting it was so loud). Yet he continues to voice chat, and I cannot fall asleep. I finally muster the courage at around **2:30a** and tell him ""Hey _____, it's literally 2:30a and I have a midterm in just over 5 hours. I am unable to get any sleep right now due to how loud that game is, can you please stop talking?"" I knew the clicking and typing would be somewhat loud, but better than the noise from speaking at least. He said ""Ok"" and **continued to play the game for another 45 minutes**. At the end of his call (I still can't sleep), he told his friend he was going to ""turn off the game because I am inconveniencing my roommate"" which I thought was passive aggressive but I was so tired idek. Either way, it was around 3:30a by the time the laptop and call were shutdown, and the room went dark. 

I slowly, without him noticing, stick my head outside of the oven that is under my blanket to enjoy the dark room when all of a sudden it lights up again! He literally pulled out his phone and started to listen to videos ***through the fucking speakers***. I lose it, because I know there's not a chance I'll fall asleep. I get up without saying a word, put on normal clothes, grab my alarm clock and blanket along with backpack with school supplies, and walk to the class where my midterm is going to be in about 4 hours from that time. I arrive in about 15 mins, and probably fall asleep around 5:30a on the hard-tile floor right next to the door to the classroom.

I've read other stories online, and to me this seems to cross a line. I understand that I'm not the only one living in the room and that I need to be empathetic to his wishes as well, but I absolutely need my sleep before a midterm and I feel as if it's non-negotiable. His lack of support or understanding to me seems entirely apathetic, perhaps even failing to understand why sleep is so important to me before a test (again, he has admitted he doesn't care much at all for academia). I have considered that since he and I were both raised in very different areas that perhaps the customs we were ingrained with are contrasted heavily, and I really want to see the good side of him and ensure that my mind isn't just making him a scapegoat here for my personal issues, hence this thread. If you read this far, thank you so very much and I hope this was somewhat entertaining. All I ask for is advice or just your opinion on the matter. Am I absolutely crazy? Again, only a few hours of sleep in the last 60 hours and I don't function well on low sleep, so if I'm bats*** crazy right now just give it to me straight.

**TL;DR- Roommate partakes in activities late into the night that prevent me from sleeping, and last night continued to do so after I asked him to be quiet multiple times. As a result I walked across campus around 5a to sleep outside the class I had a midterm at 8a.

I’m failing my classes, I’m in second year of Uni and switched majors to marketing. The idea of marketing sounds interesting to me but it seems like a useless degree, and I don’t want to be stuck in sales. And yes, the idea interests me but I can’t even tell if I actually like it. I’m stuck with these classes I need for first year. Financing, accounting, stats, economics. All these courses I hate. Plus, after reading around it seems like marketing is a bit useless. I talked to an advisor and they told me to just plan out my schedule and make time to study. It really didn’t help much. I’m scared of taking a year off because I’m a forgetful person. Example, I haven’t done a math course in two years and I forget so many things, which is why stats is so hard right now. There is no other degree I’m interested in. 

Here are things I dislike:
I’m not a math person
I hate science
I’m not a people person so I feel like my options are limited. 
I’ve tried computer science and wow I was bad at it. That gave me stress.

I don’t know if I should stay in Uni or drop out. If I drop out I don’t know what to do after that. I hate being behind, I don’t get along with people younger than me, and I don’t want to be in school for 6 years. 

My only hobby is art, but even that I haven’t done a ton of. It’s been almost a year since I’ve completed an art piece. I can’t see it being my profession, as I’m so critical of myself. Plus careers in it are very low pay.

Things I like is the way social media works, and the aspect of YouTube or maybe even filming. I have little to no experience in filming though so I feel like it’s a hard to tell how well I am at it. Only thing is there are not degrees that offer similar fields to these. Also weird dream of mine but opening a cat cafe or something would be cool. But I’m stressed I need an education in something. I feel like in today’s society it is hard to get a well paying job without a degree. 

I just don’t know what to do. I know I’m young but I just can’t help but want to be finished. I feel awkward switching to a trade school cause everyone will be younger than me by the time I go (it takes two years to get into a program).

We have a lot in common and got on very well initially. We both commute into school and she lives on my route so we decided to carpool, with me driving. It’s now week 5 and she has become incredibly clingy and I cannot stand it. Our course is very full on and structured and we have every class together and she will not leave my side all day. It’s stopping me from making other good friends because she is just always there whenever I am talking to someone. She doesn’t even join in conversations I have with other people, she literally told me the other day that she doesn’t want to make any other friends. I think it’s probably because she is incredibly judegmental and thinks she is better than everyone around her. 

I am very introverted and like my own company so I am finding it incredibly difficult to put up with someone following me around all day. She’s also generally quite a negative person which I find hard to deal with all the time because I am generally a positive, happy person and I feel like she is trying to drag me down. I hate sitting next to her in tutorials because she is so critical of every tiny detail of my work. I don’t know what to do though because we carpool and have every class together so it is very difficult to get any space from her. If I go and sit away from her she will just follow me, believe me I have tried.  I can only get away from her at lunch if I make up a really good excuse, otherwise she just follows me wherever I go.

I did 6 and I tried to do the 7th before graduation, which was an AP exam, but I failed the test and was late. my only option was to take the last SAT test that they had available and that I took classes for in High school , which was World History . 

Now I did not take that exam in May or June because I was not ready and didn't study for it, and now the closest day for the test is in December, and that became my plan. 

But a chance for me to study in a military college came up from a government program that they do to hire people in the military in positions that they need. So if they need engineers, they would send a very limited number of students to study engineering in these military colleges in the United States. They required the student to speak English well and had Intrest in working with the military. I applied, and they required me to get them an equivalency, which I was working on. But I was also required to do an SAT with assay test and a TOEFL exam. 

Here comes the Issue, the only registration date for the SAT was In December, the same date which I was planning on taking World History to do the equivalency, and I can't take both exams on the same day, which meant that I had to change my plan and take another exam which is U.S History in November, which Is a very short time period to study for a subject that I didn't take classes for and know nothing about, Just so I could continue with my military college application. 

Or I could ditch my chance to apply for the military college, and just go with the first plan and apply for a regular University locally. 

Keep in mind that I worked very hard and went with all the procedures required for my US military college application, and it would be a waste of money and time if I decide to not take the required exams.

So what should I do? Take the World History test in December and just do the equivalency and apply for a local University?

Im a freshman and have gone out of state, leaving behind all but one friend. i know a couple of people years above me that ive been able to talk to, but they're almost always busy anyways.

i thought that going here would be a fresh start where i can change from who i was in high school but the truth is that ive just stayed the same. im very shy and quiet which has made simply talking to people very hard. my roomate also basically only does homework, sleeps, or plays video games which has made it extremely hard to go out and make friends, as he is very against partying aswell. Ive made one actual friend, simply because of one of my hobbies, and he commutes to class so he is hardly even here. every single weekend has been spent in my dorm room watching netflix or trying to talk to old friends who are out enjoying themselves. classes and grades started off strong but i know that its going to start slipping away the longer i am putting up with this. ive tried to look into clubs, too, but nothing seems interesting and ive missed all of the callouts already.

on fall break i talked with a few friends and made plans to visit them and go out to clubs, and in that one singular night i had more fun and made more friends than i have here in two months. the school im at is not a party school and there is nothing like that here for people under 21. knowing that im not gonna be able to do anything like that again for a long time is really sad because of how much fun i had and how many friends i made. i want to transfer really bad but my parents wont allow me, even though this school would be nearly $30,000 cheaper per year. maybe im not giving the school enough of a chance, but i truly cant ever see things getting better. ive started to skip some classes and my motivation to actually succeed in class is dying fast, but none of this is going to change their opinion. the program rankings are meaningless if i already dislike my major and could care less about what i end up in.

the only thing thats made me happy here is my singular obscure hobby of sneakers, and ive tried really hard to make conversation with people with shoes i like but that never works. ive talked so little in the past two months that when people say they like my shoes i don't even know how to respond and it feels like ive missed a chance to make a friend. i wouldnt have gone to this school if i had been accepted to my state school, but i was denied for absolutely no reason.

am i really not giving this school enough of a chance? i keep hearing that college is supposed to be the best four years of your life and it seems like the clearest, easiest solution is sitting right in front of me, but my parents wont let me take it. maybe im just not letting myself see myself being happy here but i really have no clue how to make it better. i know the more i reach out to old friends to talk the more i am just burdening their fun with my problems, and need to do something different",college,i hate my college and can't do anything about it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/deab5x/i_hate_my_college_and_cant_do_anything_about_it/,1570417995.0

I am a long time lurker and a first time poster. 
I am here to gain some perspective on some grades I got back today. 
I am a Neuroscience major, in my third year of university, at a prestigious Canadian school. My ultimate goal is medicine and/or PhD to teach medicine at the university level. I understand very few do get in their first or even second time and I am completely satisfied with pursuing a master's or another healthcare related degree such as Radiation therapy, physical therapy, etc after my undergraduate degree and keep trying for medicine. 

My first two years of university were extremely difficult. I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, had a major falling out with my abusive father and was on the verge of being kicked out for an ""honour"" related incident. I subsequently developed severe anxiety and depression which went untreated for the better part of a year. 
It took the next year and a couple months to gradually get back to at least 80% of my old, motivated, overachieving self. Pulling myself out of the darkest, suicidal pit I've ever been in was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. All of this while maintaining a full course load 5/5 fall/winter, taking spring and summer classes and doing research (can't stop the hustle just because I'm dying, right?)

As a result, my cumulative GPA to now is 3.3, which might as well be a 2.0 in term of getting into Canadian medical schools. Fortunately, a few schools drop the lowest full year GPA and most place emphasis on the last 60 credits (irrelevant if I end up doing another degree but I'll still try to apply after my third year for entrance after fourth year). 

I am doing much better now and feel more like my old self than I have in the past two years. I wrote my first midterm of the semester last week, which was a pharmacology midterm. I thought I studied hard for it, as in going over the lectures, rewriting notes, studying with a friend, but my grade turned out to be much lower than I had anticipated. It is 25% of the course grade and I still have a 35% midterm and a 45% final left. But I am really baffled as to where I went wrong. 

It may have been that I had social media distractions when studying so I didn't actually understand as much as I thought I did or maybe I didn't study the details enough as the exam was tricky and it seemed like more than one answer was correct. It could also be that I generally don't study with a partner or group as it doesn't really help me but I tried something new. My friend got a great mark however and we both had the same level of understanding as I saw it. 

I am just wondering what you guys think went wrong and what I can do to improve next time. Also, you now know my whole situation and some thoughts on it might be helpful.

For some context, I'm taking an Engineering Design class, the one where you do CAD, and I already have around 2 years of CAD experience so I know the stuff pretty well. I like helping people in general and helping my classmates in any case that any of them might need it. I have two classes with this one guy who we sit next to each other for both classes. One of the classes is the Engineering Design class. He seems to be struggling getting a hold of the software we use. 

So, I was trying to help him get a hold of the tools of the software earlier today and I came off pressuring and I might've given him a bad vibe. He didn't like that. He was upset about it. I'm a freshman and he seems like he's been in school for a year or two and I can understand why he was upset. After I gave him a bad vibe until class ended, we spoke nothing to each other at all so he was pretty upset. I tried to rush him a bit too much and I was at fault. I feel dead serious bad about it, I've been beating myself up for the past couple of hours and Idk what to do. I want to apologize to him next time I see him, which is on Tuesday. But I don't know how to not come off as a ""cocky little bitch"". 

I'm a hardcore introvert and have a hard time making friends. I and the guy are good friends especially since we work together in the other class we share which is Calc 2, a pretty tough class. 

But yeah, today ended badly. I don't want to repeat the same mistake again.

     Coming into university, I tried convincing myself that they were right and that getting a bachelors in Biology and attending dental school in the future is the right path for me, however, I’ve realized that I’ve been lying to myself for far too long. I don’t like science and most importantly I don’t want to become an orthodontist. Science doesn’t captivate my mind and it’s hard for me to understand the concepts. I’m currently taking “Intro to Chemistry” but I’m having a really difficult time with both the lecture and the lab. I failed the first exam, but my professor drops our lowest test score so that’s good news, and I’m having a difficult time learning the material even by attending help-sessions and office hours. 

One day during lecture, I looked around the class and realized how out of place I really am and how I can’t see myself succeeding in the science courses, whatever the science subject is. How am I supposed to do good in “Organic Chemistry” if I can’t even do good in “Intro to Chemistry”? Not only that but the labs are a pain in the ass for me. I’ve never been good with labs in high school and I’ve always had a hard time getting the experiments done. I’m a bit of a slow learner and it takes time for me to understand what to do but in labs I don’t have the time to slowly understand what’s going on and why. 

 I don’t place money as the number one priority but rather I place the significance on whether or not I’ll feel passionate about my undergraduate degree and feel as if my future career will have a positive impact on people’s lives and the world as a whole. I know it sounds really childish to pursue a career that will have an impact on “the world as a whole” but I’ve always had the mindset that I only live once and rather than trying to pursue money for my own self gain, I should instead pursue the goal of trying to make the world a better place for people now and future generations. 

Now if I do change majors, I’m not quite sure what to change to. I want to study something that I’ll feel motivated and passionate to learn about. As of the time I’m typing this, tomorrow I have an appointment with my academic advisor and we’ll be discussing about this topic as well. I just need different views from different people to see what is the right direction that I should take.

TL;DR: I’m a first year student majoring in biology but I don’t like science and I’m struggling with it. Parents want me to become an orthodontist but I don’t want to. I want to pursue a degree that I’ll feel passionate about and have a future career that will allow me to help people.",college,Need some guidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/d9cvzo/need_some_guidance/,1569480074.0

ive been crying a lot lately because my parents always acted like nothing was a big deal. i tried to kill myself twice and they literally have never talked to me about it. in high school i told them i thought i had an eating disorder and had been regularly going ~3 days without eating, my mom told me it wasnt their job to feed me. i also get panic attacks around them that make me feel like i am going to die, and they have never acknowledged that this is a problem. so ive been realizing that all these things really are bad things and its been hard :(

I’ve been living on campus for the past year and I had to move to a new room with a new roommate for the Summer semester 3 months ago. We’re set to stay here for the next 9 months or so now, but I don’t think I can handle that.

My roommate is an absolute nightmare. This is going to be a very long list of shit, so bare with me. He’s completely homophobic and I’m gay, so I have to completely filter out that part of myself around him to avoid any awkwardness or even physical danger. He breaks every rule imaginable; he smokes weed and cigarettes in the house to the point where the floor of our building always stinks, which our neighbors have complained about more than once. He also does all types of other drugs and drinks constantly at the place. He often hosts parties at the apartment, even on weekdays. He has had about 5 different girls stay with us and I don’t mean for just one night, it’s for days at a time - to the point where they are cooking meals here and bringing their laundry. One night, he told a girl she could straight up sleep in my room while I was gone without even asking my permission.

He has left stains on the carpet and he has this horrifying habit of wiping his ass and throwing the tissue in the bathroom trash can instead of flushing. He takes food and other household items from me without asking first all of the time. I end up buying all of the toilet paper, laundry detergent etc.

I could go on but these are the main things. You guys might ask why I haven’t done anything yet, but I’ve tried. Countless conversations and arguments about every single one of these issues have gone nowhere. Our RA for the Summer was completely useless, would warn him and even saw what he was doing but would never do anything. Luckily, our new RA seems like he may help. What I want to ask is, what can really be done here? I think he absolutely deserves to be kicked out altogether, or at least moved to another space, but I’m worried this won’t happen. A “conflict resolution” or whatever is completely out of the question in my opinion at this point. He’s definitely not going to stop being homophobic and he’s not going to stop doing hard drugs. I don’t want to have to go to the trouble of moving out as that’s completely unfair. I’ve noticed in my past year at this school that they don’t enforce rules almost at all here, but good lord this guy is doing EVERYTHING they claim they kick people out for? If they don’t give him some kind of consequence then I guess that’s carte blanche for everyone to do absolutely anything they want.",college,Can my roommate be kicked out/moved?

I am a 3rd year college student, studying psychology, taking anywhere from 15-18 credits per semester, and commuting about 30-45 minutes each way to my university while living at home. I have tried to work part time while in school a few different times at various jobs, one was even an on campus job that I thought would be easier to manage than one off campus. It was a bit easier but still very hard for me.

I don’t wanna come off as entitled in this post. But I just feel like nobody talks about how difficult it is for some people to work while in school. I how hate unemployed students are looked at as lazy. Being a student is a full time job itself! Especially for people like me that have been diagnosed with severe anxiety. All the semesters I worked I felt physically ill from anxiety every single day. To be honest, there were points during midterms and finals where I felt suicidal, like I was caught in this never ending cycle of stressing out and could never get my mind off school/work, even when I had down time. Yes, I’m on medication and in therapy on and off. it helps a bit but it doesn’t stop the constant feeling of dread and being overwhelmed to the point of constantly being on the verge of a full on panic attack and mental breakdown. 

Family and even some friends have made me feel shitty because I prefer not to work during the school year. People like to point out the fact that I’m in an “easy major” and don’t live on campus so therefore I need to be working.  I really don’t like people that think that every waking moment needs to be productive and anyone who requires down time is lazy. It just isn’t a healthy mentality for anyone. Plus, my grades are way better when I’m not working. I am actually even on track to graduate a semester early. Yet people still are very judgmental :(

After high school I went to a community college for 2 years and studied accounting and computer science, did pretty well in those two years and got out with a 3.0 gpa. I never actually graduated from there because I withdrew from some classes and didn't have enough credits. I decided instead of doing another semester of classes and getting my associates there I would transfer to a 4 year college and so I did. Probably the worst mistake of my life. 

The first semester I bombed religion class and my excel class and my gpa dropped to like a 2.4. I thought okay this is gonna be harder than community college so I tried working harder next semester. I failed history and got a D in business analytics while withdrawing from cost accounting class. My gpa is now a 1.7. I was so fucking mad because I'm already behind from all my friends and now I'm even more behind. I don't think any internship would take someone with a 1.7 gpa and accounting is just too hard now and I can't understand it.

450,nicoleroc23,1567957631,/r/college/comments/d1cklc/my_roommate_keeps_getting_sloppy_drunk_and_its/,"Sorry for bad formatting, on mobile. 

I have this roommate - lets call her G - that I absolutely adore in personality. She is super funny, really easy to talk to, and fun to hang out with. We live together in a double on a standard co ed hall, and usually go out in a group of 5-10 people on the weekends to party at the frats. We go to a pretty nerdish school so the frat culture here doesn’t really go too hard and is often safer than the big off campus house parties, which is why we go to the frats.

G has recently been in a not so good place mentally and has been going out and way overdoing it every weekend, usually both Friday and Saturday nights. I wouldn’t care, seeing as its her life and her right to do whatever she wants, if it wasn’t for the fact that its ruining my relationships with other people on the floor and her. I spend every morning filling her in on what she did the night before. I never get to spend time with my boyfriend on the weekends (because he’s in res life in our dorm and is responsible for keeping an eye on the sloppy pass out level drunk kids, which is literally always and only ever my roommate). Even if I don’t go out so I can stay in and do work, she comes back and I’m responsible for putting her to bed and holding her hair while she pukes, which detracts from my work time. 

I’ve tried talking to her about it but she always says it won’t happen again and - surprise! - it does. I was supposed to spend last night having a post party game night with a handful of friends on the floor, and we ended up having to walk her home from a party and stay up with her until 5am when she was finally sober enough to lie down and sleep. 

I’m sick of it, other people on the floor are sick of it. We didn’t sign up to babysit her. What the hell do we do?? I love her as a person but if this continues it will ruin our relationship. It’s putting strain on my friendships and my romantic relationship.

453,vallanlit,1567308107,/r/college/comments/cy519z/advice_for_ivy_league_schools/,"Hi, I'm a junior in high school and recently I've been thinking about college more and more as I have to start applying in a few months... :')  My whole life I've been someone who's done work with the goal of getting into an Ivy League school (aim high and fall short right? lol) and unfortunately a lot of people in my life make casual comments like ""you don't even have to worry, you're literally going to Harvard"" when I express worries about college. Not gonna lie, this really stresses me out at times because I'm not one of those national-award-winning top-notch students at all. So I guess I was wondering if you guys could help predict my ""odds"" (Harvard/Yale/Princeton mostly) and give me some advice as I finish the last two years of high school? btw, i'll just be listing off anything I think is relevant, so please let me know if something here doesn't actually matter that much!

Grades: I plan on going into premed as a biology or chemistry major in undergrad, then applying to med school. I'm aware this may change but I've been interested in the medical field since I was like 5 haha, and most other career fields don't seem appealing to me at all. This being said, my GPA is an unweighted 3.97 -  oops a single A-  - and weighted 4.0 (my school only goes up to 4.0, even with APs/Honors) - I know percent doesn't matter but my grades have generally all been above 96%. By the end of senior year I'll have about 10-13 APs, of which I currently have five 5s and one 4. I just took the SAT last week, so scores aren't out yet but I'm fairly certain I scored above 1500, as my practice tests all ranged from 1510-1570 and I don't believe I got that many questions wrong. Depending on how I do on the SAT I may or may not take the ACT.

Courses: Ironically I've been stronger in humanities (english + social studies?) courses than science/math courses so far, with most of my test-outs + APs being humanities subjects. However, I'm taking AP Bio, Chem, Physics, and perhaps a bio/chem course at my local university in the next two years. On the other hand, my math is only average in terms of my courses - I haven't tried hard at math until the last few years; I'm taking AP Calc BC senior year. 

Extracurriculars: Here's the part where I feel like I'm lacking the most compared to other Ivy League candidates. I guess one major extracurricular is music for me; I've been playing piano for maybe 10 years now, and I've won a couple different recognitions (i.e. Advanced Bach kind of stuff, if you know you know), and a few competitions that allowed me to play at Carnegie Hall. My piano teacher is making me record 3-5 pieces to make a small portfolio. I also play flute, unfortunately there's a lack of achievements here, although I'm competing in two competitions this year (my first for flute) and hopefully they go well. I've used music to volunteer at senior living spaces and such. \*\*note: I am Asian, so not sure if this would seem better/worse because of possible biases.

My other main extracurriculars are my science/medicine related ones. At my school I'm in Ocean Bowl, Red Cross, and HOSA. The first two haven't led to any distinctions, although there's a (unlikely) chance in my senior year to win a competition. For HOSA, my partner and I compete in Forensic Science and we've won two first places at regionals, and one fifth-place title at states. This year and senior year, we have a shot at two more regional placements, two top 3 state placements, and maybe one national title/placement \*\*the last one is UNLIKELY LOL\*\*. I am president of HOSA in my school as a junior (hopefully senior as well...). Additionally, every year I volunteer as a coach for Science Olympiad for elementary school in the event GENE-ius (it's about biology), and some of my students have done very well. I was accepted into a two-week summer program at my local university (don't want to reveal the location but it's a top college, not Ivy League though) in Human Anatomy. I helped out in my dental office for around 20-25 hours this summer, and plan on volunteering/shadowing at my local hospital next summer, since I was too young this year.

A few miscellaneous extracurriculars: I am the treasurer of another club at my school, but it is mostly a for-fun club than anything else. I've had lots of experience with little kids since I volunteer at my Chinese school and K-4 summer camps, work at Kumon, and coach elementary school Science Olympiad. i suck at sports though whee

pls note: i'm not trying to brag, i feel like im doing the opposite. i also don't actually expect myself to get into ivy league with these stats, i know they're not very impressive in terms of people who are president/vice president of numerous clubs and earn awards at everything they do. although at the same time i really wish i could get in, so there's a part of me that thinks ""well, maybe, maybe?"" ... i just want a few objective opinions of my chances. also, i realize that even if i'm ,,qualified"" it doesn't mean ivy league is right for me, and i get that because i don't even know if i could handle it lol, it seems kind of intense. anyway just a few disclaimers here! please don't be mean :')

im not too excited because i had a rough time making friends last year. dont get me wrong, i did make friends, even some really close ones, but i wasnt exactly satisfied with my social life. i met a good amount of people and tried actively to befriend a lot of them, but it only takes a few coffee or lunch hangouts to realize if you're not gonna get along well with someone.

now that move in is in a couple of days for most people (some people I know even moved in already and are posting pictures of them reuniting with friends), my social medias are flooded with people posting countdowns, recaps and pictures of last year etc. one girl even made a video with all footage from last year with all her friends, saying that it was the best year of her life etc.

i know what you see on social media is curated to look as good as possible, but after watching that i felt like pure shit. i didnt have any of the same experiences that girl did, hanging out with a huge group of friends on the weekends, doing fun activities etc. 

when it became clear that most people had settled in with their friend groups first semester last year, i put my head down and worked hard with school. i figured spring semester would be a fresh start, and while it was definitely better, (in that i became closer to people i had met first semester), i still didnt find my group of ""my people"". 

a lot of people dont need a friend group to have a stimulating social life, but im not one of them. ive been in friend groups my entire life, and i met my best high school friends literally on the first day. i was never in this position before of feeling this lonely. 

im trying to keep positive about the upcoming year but its getting really hard. any advice on turning my situation around? or did anyone have a similar experience, where they only met their good friends in the later years of college?",college,i feel like i wasted my freshman year,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ctp56c/i_feel_like_i_wasted_my_freshman_year/,1566448993.0
457,GothamsNewHero,1566405976,/r/college/comments/ctjg1n/my_trouble/,"I honestly don't know what to do anymore, I have no direction, no passion. My entire life, my parents always told me I needed to go to college. They never graduated, my dad had no money growing up and never felt the need to go out to college. My mother went to college for almost a year, but halfway through, she had my sister and I, so she was forced to stop going to take care of us, she was very young and had a lot on her plate. Growing up, they always explained the importance of finishing school, (to them, that's getting a higher degree), with them not going to college, they knew how hard it was and still is to make a living without a degree, and it always felt as if going to college was just another right of passage, something I had to do to make a good living for myself and HAD to do after high school. Ugh, so uninteresting right? But here's the thing, I never wanted to go, not since I was in middle school. I always felt like I never would've liked it (spoiler alert: I hate it). My older sister, as per mentioned earlier, went to college, and endured it, shes in her 3rd year now, going for the masters, but she was always liked school, and she got to live at my grandmothers house for a ride to school (LOVED our grandmother, I thought for a while more than our mom), so she was hardly ever home, she had her licence, but no car cause we had no money for another car. Finally, at least for her, she got her car this past summer, doesn't let no one else drive it, but what did that mean for me? I had to wait and do the same thing, here's the catch, were 2 grades apart but only 1 year apart, and all her classes are online. So imagine my fury, she has all online classes, and me, the odd man out, has to somehow get to college which is 45 min away. All that washed away now, In early June, my mother died, she was 38 years old, I wasn't home when it happened, I was at the aforementioned college for an overnight orientation, so me and college didn't start off right. I couldn't go there since I couldn't go during summer (it was a requirement for all freshman without 9 college credits) so I signed up for my local community college, it was only right, right? Wrong. I already hated the entire idea of college, and my dad told me I could take a year off if I needed time to heal, I didn't listen at the time. There's still time to drop all my classes and get my refund, but everyone else is telling me this is change and that you have to get used to it, so just deal with it right now and it'll get better, to me, it doesn't and it hasn't, college is a pain in the ass, the traffic, the work, the classes, they all get me upset and I end up spending my day either upset, or in the work. I tried looking into technical schools but the ones I live around are (sorry to say) pretty shitty and expensive. I didn't even know what I wanted to do in college, I change my mind all the time and have no real direction on my profession about where the fuck I'm going. Any ideas?

In school, I had about 3 friends. 1 of them I considered my best friend because he was the one I talked to the most and was the closest with. We were both much alike, which is why we had so much to talk about. Ironically, our lack of social skills was one thing we had in common and was something we talked about and even laughed at. During my last few days in high school, I had the creeping feeling of not being able to see my friends daily again. I tried to ignore it. I tried to think that everything was going to be alright. If I'm being honest, I hate farewells, which is why I refused to get all sentimental. I've been doing a somewhat decent job at hiding it all this time, but now it's all starting to come out. I haven't really talked to anyone in college. Granted, I know its mainly my fault. I'm not putting in the effort of talking to anyone either. My hobbies and interests are not exactly the most normal. I'm a huge weeb. Anime is practically the thing I love the most to talk about. It can be hard to find people like that, ya know? My college is fairly small, so as far as I'm concerned, there are no clubs here. I'm saying that cause I've heard a good tip for making friends is by joining a club.  
Honestly, I always believed that my lack of social skills meant I didn't need friends. But now I've been proven wrong the hard way. I still talk to my old friends from school. The one I'm the closest with says he's also feeling lonely. So I still have that friendship at least.   
Obviously, I don't know what the interests of my new classmates are. I'm taking 4 classes and some of them have different students from others. By looks alone, non of them seem to have the same interests as me. Our spanish teacher assigned us to make a whatsapp chat which everyone joined (including me). I see them talking there all the time, but I'm too shy to even talk through there.  
I haven't made a new friend in so long that I've unironically forgotten how it's like. I seem to have forgotten how a friendship is even made. I don't remember how me and my friends from school became friends. We sorta just gradually started talking to each other during recess. I never see any of my classmates outside of class, so I doubt that's going to happen anytime soon.  
During my waiting between classes, I usually just sit at the library and start using reddit until its time for the next class. I realize that by doing this I won't be able to socialize and find new friends, but I really don't know what else to do...",college,I'm so lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cs8s3f/im_so_lonely/,1566188570.0

I currently attend a large out of state flagship public school on a scholarship (I'm going to be a sophomore this year). The quality of life at my school here is low - there's not that many weekend events on campus and apart from basketball the sports scene is weak. There's not much school spirit and people generally seem detached from each other. We're also in the middle of nowhere in pretty much basically a farm/rural area. The party scene has slowly been going away while on weekends only a few parties are held - pretty much the only things available on campus during the weekends. It gets isolating here rather quick if you don't have a lot of friends/people to hang out with. 

During first semester I pretty much isolated myself from people in order to maintain a high GPA for my major and joined major specific clubs for the resume boost (big mistake overall) and never thought to make a friend group.  Second semester I decided I wanted to transfer due to my general unhappiness and financial reasons, and did not join any more clubs or attempt to socialize with people if I was just going to transfer out anyways. At the beginning of the semester, I  applied to my instate public school and was accepted but later in the semester, I ultimately decided not to attend out of fear that I would have to start all over and I didn't want to do that again; additionally I felt rather uneasy and unsure throughout the transfer process, so I decided to stick it out and come back for another year.     

Going into this year, I've decided to not over worry as much as I did about academics and try to involve myself with clubs and events that I'm actually interested in and hopefully meet new people and gain new friendships. But if I could go back in time, I would go to my freshman year self in high school and tell myself to take the most challenging course load possible, involve myself in strong extracurriculars, and get the highest SAT/ACTs scores that I could. This way, I wish I could've looked into and gotten into selective LACs and smaller private universities,  that I think I would've enjoyed the tight knit/collaborative atmosphere, a solid friend group, gotten stellar financial aid, and would've had great career career aspects. I wish I could go back and change everything, but it's too late.    Does anyone else feel the same way? Please feel free to share your experiences. Is anyone else feeling nervous of going back?

461,newphysicsstudent,1565510646,/r/college/comments/cou6lj/attending_a_mediocre_university_feeling_as_if_ive/,"I'm depressed. I've been avoiding the facts of my situation but the truth remains and I'm slightly afraid it'll show the more  I'm at the university. Everyone else seems excited to be here but I feel as if I've failed myself and the people around me.

This might sound pompous but I promise I'm just trying to give background information. If I felt others assessments of me were true now, then I probably wouldn't be posting here.

I've always been immensely interested in the world around me and because of that, I have a strong passion for learning. My favourite pastime is to study and I enjoy reading everything from scientific journals to French literature. Apparently I've built a persona over the past four years due to this. Most of the people I'd meet would speak about how ""smart"" I was, or that I was very advanced. I've gone through my life accepting this because I've never met anyone to whom I could speak; everyone seemed to be on a different planet than I was and I really didn't have any friends. Actually, I don't have any friends now.

In November of last year, I took the SATs. I was immensely nervous because I have ADHD and have never done that well on standardised tests. Low and behold, my score was subpar. Apparently, the format of the test was changed on my testing day and the curve was immensely steep. It doesn't matter; I still blame myself for not doing well.

I applied to six colleges and only got accepted into my safety school. When I saw my SAT score, I knew this would happen. I tried to regain my confidence and subsequently did so, until the people I've known for years started asking where I was going to college. When I told them, they paused. I could see it in their faces:

Sometimes they would try to be polite: ""Oh... That's great..."" However, at other times, the comments were much more straightforward: ""*What?* I mean, it's an OK college, but... I thought you'd get into something way better than that. What happened?"" Even an old friend said to me, ""Well... I hate to say it... but you're really not as smart as I thought you were,"" after previously supporting me when I was applying.

I'm hurt and I feel like a fraud. It's been hard to keep my confidence up when I keep getting these comments. No one was proud of me, including myself, and all the work I've done over the past four years? I suppose it was for nothing.

At the university's orientation, everyone seemed so excited to be there... and here I was, feeling like a failure. The dean kept mentioning how it's a top 100 school, and I felt like it was a cruel joke. People were going around saying, ""I was bullied in high school, people told me I was stupid. Everyone was surprised to hear I got into this university!"" Then here I am, with everyone being surprised for the exact opposite reason. My advisor even said that my endeavours were ""only suited for the gifted, but I could try."" I felt stupid once again; it must be true, I've been living in a fairytale land.

So, I'm depressed. I feel like I've let everyone down, including myself. I know I have shot at a better university for graduate school, but how can I get over this feeling? It's 10 days until I leave, and I don't want to keep feeling like an idiot. Is it true, what people are saying? Why am I being treated this way? Do they not understand how hard it is to get into a university to begin with, or is it not? Am I alone?

Thanks for reading this post regardless. I'm sorry to pour all of my emotions here.

TLDR: I got into a university and everyone was unpleasantly surprised at its lack of prestige. I feel like an idiot, a fraud. People at the university think it's a great institution, but I don't see it the same way since everyone was disappointed with me. I can't tell who is wrong. Am I alone in this?

After my freshman year I realized I wanted to switch my major to music business instead of jazz vocal performance. One of the conditions of my scholarship is that I have to keep my major if not they reserve the right to take away my scholarship or lessen it. I have friends who switched their major to Music Business however they were in the classical department the jazz department is more strict. I asked if I could switch and keep my scholarship and they said no. We actually had lots of back and forth on the topic. But because it was a $30,000 scholarship I decided to just stay in my program because I couldn't afford to go to school without it. Last year my advisor had a meeting with me and he said that he could see I didn't really want to be in the program and I was unmotivated. He said that the Music Business program would be a better fit for me and because of this he would allow me to switch and keep my full scholarship. And so I did.

Fast forward to this summer I am looking at my aid package and my scholarship isn't even posted. I have to talk with them and they post it but its only half as much!!! I've been communicating back and forth with them and they said that because I switched they cut my scholarship in half. I don't even have it in writing that my advisor (who is the head of the department) said I could keep the whole thing he just told me that in a meeting. 

I feel tricked honestly! I never really got along with my advisor we had significant creative differences and this isn't the first time they took away my scholarship! They tried to take away my scholarship before because I failed two classes however this was unlawful because my scholarship requirement states that I have to get a B or above in all performance classes and maintain a 2.5 GPA and even though I failed those two classes they were not performance classes and I still had over a 2.5 GPA they have since changed the requirements lol maybe because of me however I feel like they just don't like me and have been giving me a hard time and wanting to take away my scholarship for a long time. Because a girl a year above me got to switch her major to something completely unrelated to music but as long as she stayed in ensembles they let her keep her scholarship. 

I don't have it in writing and I'm 99% sure if I try to switch my major back they won't accept me into the program and I don't have $15,000.

464,Xavien5,1564849465,/r/college/comments/clkm24/changing_majors/,"Hello!

I'm in quite a complicated state of mixed emotions.  Just a quick background is that I have been born and raised in California but am in computer science right now for National Taiwan University as an undergraduate, now going to sophomore.  I've talked to upperclassmen, my old friends at home that changed majors, so let's skip the usual emotions people have about changing majors and cut to the chase due to my tendencies of elongating topics unnecessarily.

I have grown up with given talents in art such as drawing, video editing, photoshopping, picture framing, etc related stuff from my Mom, but was also gifted with a brain good for STEM majors.  I hate to brag about myself but it current is a gift and curse.  Growing up I have always enjoyed drawing and other creative activities and could do those for hours and hours.  It wasn't until middle school where I slowly started to stop any art related hobbies, especially when I got into high school and was so busy with classes to maintain a 4.4GPA and a bunch of high standards for colleges.  My mom thought it was best for me to go with STEM studies due to her own experience with harsh reality on such a subjective job (my mom did find quite huge success with graphic designing with high paying salary).  This prompted me to just work hard for STEM classes that were AP and honors without any regard for art at all.

Let's just say despite all the awards, varsity sports, AP credits waived, etc, my year for those born in 2000, college admission rates were the worst by far in history.  While part of the reason of going to National Taiwan University for computer science was it's high top 50 global ranking for my major, me getting rejected by other colleges, relatives in Taiwan and a chance to master Mandarin Chinese, I am currently struggling on my passion.

I'll admit to being lazy and taking shortcuts for my past freshmen year in computer science in order to pass my requirement classes, but when I actually sit down and code, like what I am doing right now during summer break, it just does not have a spark of interest like I did with drawing as a kid.  There is barely any satisfaction for coding out a hard problem and I cannot do it for hours and hours like I do with my creative hobbies.

To sum it up the problems I mainly am extremely stressed out about is:

1. Some people end up actually clicking and liking their major perhaps 2-4 years into their major.
2. I have made such a huge devotion going to the other side of the Earth for a globally ranked university with close allegiance with many other famous US schools for STEM orientated universities.
3. Going back to California to start over in a community college with the possibility of regret is a fear.
4. I have been detached from art for so long.
5. Like my mom said, if I go into art related majors, they are extremely subjective and facing the harsh reality, often people's creative work are either bashed or praised famously.
6. I have been pondering about options I would have never thought I would do growing up, such as YouTube, starting my own collection of designs for clothing, etc.  Which all start from scratch, and again, extremely subjective and risky.

Sorry if this was long, I tried to edit it and keep it as short as possible.  Any replies, suggestions, criticisms, relatable stories of changing to a completely different major with a huge environment change or motivation would be appreciated.",college,Changing Majors,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/clkm24/changing_majors/,1564867465.0

I started in 2000 and took my sweet time taking classes, switching schools, switching majors. At some point I was within a year of graduating with a CS degree when silly young me decided I liked physics more. I switched majors and through hard work got within 2 classes of graduating.  Terrible life circumstances plus the 2008 financial crisis hit and I was forced to leave and then find some kind of work to pay back my student loans.

&amp;#x200B;

Loans are finally gone. I'm going to a community college now to brush up on my math with hopes of finishing the physics degree. I have so many credits I was able to transfer (something over 100) that while I'm taking these classes I qualified for residency requirements to get my 2 year associates.

&amp;#x200B;

 With transferring into the University to finish the degree on the horizon the prospect of the school being unyielding on the final class requirements has me worried. Back in 2008 I didn't get a very satisfactory response from the school when I tried to see if I could take other classes in place of the last classes I needed. The classes were only given once a year and I flunked (thanks to the shitty life circumstances) the last time they were given and I absolutely NEEDED to take some classes or my student loans would start calling for their money and ultimately put me into default. This was what ended up happening. 2008 was a hard time for anyone to get work and even more so for someone without work experience or a degree.  My concern is because I now work full time I won't be able to make the final class and I would really like to keep working through this final class since I'm 37 and although my pay sucks it's better than minimum wage. 

&amp;#x200B;

To be fair I haven't yet asked the physics dept and I'm only thinking ahead here but while the dept might not budge on the requirements like last time the university has greatly expanded their degree and online class offerings since I last attended. It appears I MAY be able to take an Interdisciplinary studies with a Science focus or a Liberal Studies degree.  The Liberal studies degree can be done all online but having taken so many rigorous science classes I really don't want to go this route. The Interdisciplinary studies degree seems easier to stomach and while it's not 100% online the final few classes I'd need likely will be or at least during hours I can attend. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do either of these sound like a good option to explore or should I stick to my guns and finish the physics degree even if it might mean needing to quit my job? Honestly I wouldn't be too broken up about the job but I'm able to do school work at it about a quarter of the time and it looks better on my next resume than whatever min wage job I got to replace it while going to school.  I'm getting old. I just want my damn degree and to start a real career.

My name is ANON, and I was previously enrolled at COLLEGE NAME during spring of 2018. During my time of enrollment, I faced numerous challenges that put a delay on my growth and hindered me from reaching my goal of being an academically successful student at COLLEGE. After taking a full year off to be proactive about my situation, I am writing this letter in hopes of appealing my financial aid suspension which was revoked due to a low gpa as well as failure to meet the completion rate. I understand the reason for the suspension and I take full accountability for all events leading up to that point. I am writing this letter to express the importance in which I hold my education, as well as to outline the steps I plan on taking to ensure that I remain on the road to academic success and completion at COLLEGE. 

I entered my spring semester in 2018 as an independent student. Being adopted and being the only person in my family to enroll in college, I was determined to make something of myself and be successful by excelling in my studies, but I kind of came into the college experience blind and did not use the campus resources which are in place to help me like I should have. During my spring semester of 2018, a female friend of mine made an aggressive sexual advancements towards me (even after I declined multiple times) which triggered PTSD as I was sexually assaulted by women in my family for several years throughout my childhood (which is directly linked to my dependency status). This person is not a student and did not attend my school but was one of the only friends I had made so far at the time which caused me extreme anxiety. This time was very difficult for me and I often blamed myself for how things happened. At the time, she seemed genuinely unaware of her actions but due to my previous experiences it brought back feelings of depression, paranoia, PTSD, nightmares and anxiety some of which I had been professionally diagnosed with in 2015. (Documentation will be provided proving that I have been medically diagnosed with Depression DO and anxiety.) After the incident, my behavior
 spiraled down-hill. I had absolutely no family here in (
 STATE NAME, and I began lashing out at friends which in return pushed many of them away. It was hard for me to leave my apartment, and I would go days at a time without eating. Since she and I had the same circle of friends, I began to develop social anxiety. Not only because of that incident, but because of years of unresolved trauma that I was now dealing with during my first ever semester of college alone in another state. 

Eventually, my focus shifted from my studies to just getting through the week and sometimes getting through the day. I couldn’t focus. I started to fall more and more behind in my studies. My grades took a major blow and I knew I had to do something. I decided to drop 2 courses and lighten my course load. I began going to study groups and trying mybest to focus on my work and the classes that I had left. Financially I was sinking, because it was hard finding a flexible Job. I knew that I had to be selective about my working schedule since I was already failing.
 Before moving to STATE, I was helping take care of my great-aunt who raised me (I call her mom because she is the closest thing I have to a mother) and was my legal appointed guardian throughout most of my life. (documentation will be included)

 She is a high-risk diabetic and after becoming an amputee a few years ago and also having a stoke a few years prior to that, she has limited mobility and I was the one helping her before I started school. Unfortunately, with her medical bills and a mortgage my uncle (her husband) had to leave retirement to go back to work in an attempt to make extra money in order to pay regular utility bills, medical bills, and the mortgage that still remained on their house after nearly 35 years. My aunt had a few accidents from being home alone and started to miss taking important medicines in her schedule. She also ended up having an accident which caused extreme swelling in her only working foot and can cause many serious complications for a diabetic person with her medical issues. I decided to travel home on March 14th to visit her ( travel documents &amp; medical docs will be included) After visiting her and seeing the condition that she was in I knew that I had to do something and decided that I would go back and forth (driving) from STATE and STATE in order to pick up the slack and do what needed to be done for my family. My grades suffered severely as I tried to juggle my family, depression, and school. 

I was also still unemployed. Fortunately, back when the semester started I had paid my rent up until April with plans on finding a job in STATE, but because of my schedule and everything I was dealing with it was hard to find flexible work that would allow me to stay in school and handle everything that my life required from me at the time. Many nights I went to bed hungry. The bills became another thing on the list of things I had to worry about, which in return made it hard for me to focus on finishing out the semester like I had hoped. I felt like such a failure. I was so disgusted and disappointed in myself because even though I had no clue how to fix my situation I felt like I could be doing more. Although I didn’t meet my goal during the spring semester, I had spoken to my advisor and was more determined than ever to redeem myself during the summer term of 2018.  
In June just before summer term began, I received an eviction notice stating that I had until the end of the week to come up with back rent or vacate the apartment. I was devastated. (eviction notice will be included)
 I began staying with friends and sleeping on couches of friends with internet access just to complete assignments. The stress began to take a toll on my physical health being that I would rarely sleep or eat. It was at this point that I could honestly say that not dealing with my issues in a more aggressive way had potentially messed up my academic career and I needed to take some time off to get help and get my life together. There was no way that I would be giving myself a fair shot under these conditions. I felt like I never really gave myself a shot to show my full potential as a student. I ended up dropping out completely after dropping one class and then realizing I had no add/drops left. At the time I didn’t understand much about the withdrawal process, add/drop, or even how they would affect my grades and transcript. Leaving (***college name***) was devastating for me. I felt like I let down so many people who were counting on me and I most definitely let myself down. But I knew that in order to come back I had work to do. 

Since this time, my life has done a complete 360. Though I could’ve appealed sooner, I decided that taking some time off to seek help and get my affairs in order was the best move for me to ensure that when I returned to school, I came back without baggage. Since July of 2018 I began going to church where I renewed my faith. I started to receive both spiritual and professional counseling which has completely changed my life for the better. 

My living situation is also completely different as I am living with my brother who will allow me to stay with him throughout the duration of my schooling which will eliminate all major financial concerns until I graduate and will give me a fair shot at remaining focused on my school work and grades without extra distractions or stressors. My Parents (Great-aunt and Uncle) were able to pay off the mortgage on their home which lessened the financial strain that they endured and allows my uncle to be at home with my aunt 24/7. (documentation provided of paid mortgage)
If I knew then what I know now I would have definitely taken a break after my first failed semester. I didn’t understand the impact that withdrawals had on my GPA and completion rate, and I also realize that I should have taken way more advantage of the student services provided to me by the college. I also realize that accountability is everything and that I don’t have to be ashamed when things get hard nor should I be ashamed of my mental illness. There are people at my college who want to help me, but I can’t receive help if I do not ask for it.

What will be different if given the chance to return to school is that I am in a really good place and I will continue to see my therapist and spiritual counselor regularly. I will not have to worry about finances either due to the new changes in my more permanent and stable living situation. I plan on using the repeat to replace policy in order to retake some of the classes I didn’t do well in, in hopes to receive a higher grade. I will also commit to routine/scheduled meetings with my academic advisor to ensure academic accountability. I have so much support from people who want to see me succeed and are willing to hold me accountable. 

My academic advisor is AMAZING, and we’ve managed to stay in contact over the duration of my break from school. After meeting with her to construct my AIP, we have come up with a plan for the next 3 semesters that will help me get on the right track towards sap. These changes include taking on a manageable course load, using the repeat to replace program to replace the failing grades, and sticking to a strict study plan to ensure my success in the upcoming semester. Now that I have taken time off to reflect I realize that I also need to take better advantage of the resources provided to me by the school. I can attend tutoring instead of going to study groups set up by my peers and if needed I can also use the counseling that has also been set in place by the school. I have also spoken to my advisor about changing my major to Psychology. 

Going through everything that I have been through in life has made me want to change to way I think and has made me feel obligated to helping people who struggle with mental illness like I did/do. 

I am so disappointed in where I was last year, but I am so happy to say that I am not that person anymore. The old me would throw a pity party and would never have the courage to try again. The new me is fearless and accountable. Depression isn’t curable, but it is manageable when you take accountability for where you are and do the work to stay whole. I will never let myself get to that place again, especially with the support of my family, friends, and new church.   I understand that higher education is a privilege and I will never take that for granted. I also understand that financial aid is a privilege that not everyone is afforded the opportunity to have. Being that I am an independent student, there is no way that I would be afforded the opportunity to attend school without it. I honestly have no doubt that if it wasn’t for everything I went through last year, I would have excelled academically. I understand that second chances are not given often in life so if I am afforded this opportunity I will do whatever it takes to be successful and remain successful during the remainder of my academic career at COLLEGE NAME.",college,SAP appeal essay help,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cextue/sap_appeal_essay_help/,1563499942.0

I just talked to purdue for exemple and heard they don't take transfers in the CS program and other Schools might not accept credits etc. So i gotta be careful about that aswell wich means i gotta know wich school to go to and be 100% sure they accept transfers into CS and that credits Will Transfer to the degree.

470,justagoner,1562683399,/r/college/comments/cb1rtr/have_i_ruined_my_college_career_long_post/,"Let's talk.

I was doing great my first year. I ended with a 3.93 and an RA position. I took summer classes, and got ahead. I was on track to finish in three years. My second year, I tore my meniscus in the fall and ended up having to W one class. I still ended with mostly A's and an A-. In the spring, I got pneumonia, and was still recovering from my knee. I powered through and I finished off the year with a 3.7 due to a B. I decided to take three summer classes, even though I was still sick. I ended up having to withdraw two because I couldn't handle it and went back home while just finishing the online course. 

My third year (was supposed to be my last year), this is where shit got bad. My dad got really sick. I was commuting back and forth from the hospital until he passed. All my professors were working with me, as I have taken them before (but one) and they knew my nature as a student. After discussing it with two professors, they were both going to give me an incomplete (I was taking 6 classes, and I could mentally handle four finals). However, the day after finals, one of them emails me and says he reconsidered our agreement. He gives me an F. My first F ever in my entire academic career. I appealed the grade, the department and the dean's office were advocating for me. Alas, we were unable to come to an agreement and my school does not do retroactive withdraws. I took the L. 

The whole grade appeal process with no positive conclusion and the passing of my dad - it messed me up. It messed me up mentally. It messed up the detailed timeline I spent months doing so I could graduate in three years. I had to retake it, not because it was a requirement, but because I couldn't ruin my GPA. My dad would boast that he had the smartest kid out of all his friends and I was going to graduate early. So I still tried. After much deliberation, I took 7 classes in the spring, including 2 capstones and 1 independent study. I was easily writing 25-35 pages of work a week, and +150 for finals. Buuuut.. the more work I had, the worse my mental health got. It got to the 'missing-class/work-ignoring-everyone' point where I would lay on the floor of my room for days on end. I tried once more to get it together after midterms, but I couldn't catch up. I actually forgot I was taking a class because the professor had it set up on Vista Higher Learning, instead of Canvas. I didn't realize it until I met with my advisor to touch base about the summer. Now, I had to try finishing it. He gave me a D. For the other courses, I got a C-, B-, B and three I's I am still working on. 

I kept thinking to myself, I have to graduate. I even walked for graduation ffs. I thought it would give me momentum. I took the D, and did not retake it. I hope any law school who decided I was worthy of an acceptance gives me an opportunity to explain myself. 

I didn't think my mental health could get worse, but it did. All I had to do to finish was do the three I's and take five classes. That isn't too bad. It's hard work, but straight-forward. Apparently, it wasn't. I had two serious mental breakdowns and was diagnosed with severe ADHD, depression and anxiety in the last two months. Hell, I was told to go to inpatient because I couldn't cope. I cannot afford this, and can barely afford medication. I tried. I really did. I wanted to do right by my parents. 

Here I am, at the end of Summer Session I, and have failed all three classes. I was too ashamed to ask for extensions and barely left my room other than working. Ah yes, working. I have worked 35-40 hours a week all throughout college. Over the summer, I work 50-60. How you ask? It is easy to force myself into menial and mind-numbing work that pays for my bills and the classes I keep failing. I am also financially independent because my family could not afford anything, even less now with my dad not around. I have several siblings, and my mom can't do it on her own. 

I am in Summer Session II with two classes, and have yet to get graded on something. I did not apply for FAFSA or loans because I thought I was going to finish this summer. I applied for graduation, and did exit interviews. I am meeting with the assistant dean today, but I think I ruined all of my chances to get into a good law school. I hate that even after falling completely apart, my anxiety remains focused on what the aftermath is and how my actions have cost me my once-bright future. 

&amp;#x200B;

Current plan: (aside for the obvious need for therapy and medication)

Retake ALL classes with F's and that one D I got in Fall 2019. This would be 4 classes. 

Apply for Financial Aid. 

After 1.5+ years off and studying for LSAT, I hope that I can get into a good law school. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still believe that I have ruined my entire college career. I can't stop obsessing over it, and get into this really bad cycle of shame/anxiety/sadness. After two years of straight A/A-'s and 1 B, starting student organizations, becoming an RA, winning a policy competition, getting into three honors societies and every other accomplishment I could think of, it is at the LITERAL END that I fall completely apart and destroy it.

I tried so hard during my high school years to get into a school in the US and possibly into a good environment so that I surround myself with better and nicer people. 

However, as the school year is approaching faster and faster, I am getting so nervous about it. I can't go through social media because everyone looks so different from me (in terms of appearances, personalities, and even how great their lives look like) and I'm scared that I'll have no friends and repeat the life I had in America during my freshman year of high school.

Even though I am the most outgoing person ever in my home country, I've never had the courage to be and act the same way in America due to the low confidence in my broken language and the thought that people will look me down. I know this summer is when I should be having a lot of fun but I cannot do any of that because I am so scared of my future in a few months.

I started out in college at a technical school because I lacked one math credit to get into a 4 year college. My plan was to go that technical school for a year and then transfer to a 4 year college with the plan of majoring in biology or pre-vet. About 2 months into the courses I fell into a deep hole of depression and I ended up having to withdraw because I ended up in the hospital for 2 weeks. After that I decided I wouldn’t go back to school right away and I got a job. Around January of 2018 I decided that I wanted to go back to school but this time I wanted to go to art school. I thought that maybe I couldn’t do normal school so maybe I’ll try this. So I applied to my dream school and a few months later I found out I go accepted. So I started at that school in the fall of 2018 and I did really well! I got an honors scholarship and my parents were really proud of me and things were great. So I go back to school after winter break and I start out okay but I really start to slip because of depression. I end up failing all 3 classes because of it and I lose my scholarship. My parents were very upset with me and really disappointed. After spring break I go back for spring quarter and once again I slip and I end up failing two classes and passing one but with a “D”.  Towards the end of spring quarter I finally got on a medication that really worked for me and I really tried my hardest to bring my grades up but it was too close to the end of the quarter and I didn’t have enough time. 

As I stated I have depression and I really struggle with motivation. But I really think I struggle so much with motivation because I haven’t found my “passion” yet. But over this summer I started working at a doggy daycare and boarding place and it has really brought out my passion for not just dogs but animals in general. The daycare place I work at has a vets office in it and I spend a lot of time talking to them and asking questions. It really gets me feeling excited. So I really am thinking about going to school to become a veterinarian. I know vet school is highly competitive and hard to get into. But I feel that I would have the motivation now to know that I could be working with animals every day and helping them. 

My problem right now is even getting into a 4 year college. I’m not really sure where to start. My grades are terrible and the credits I have from my college right now wouldn’t transfer. So it would be like I am starting college all over again. And if I used my credits from high school I’m still missing one math credit. I just don’t know what to do and any words of advice would help. I feel like I’ve really messed things up for myself and I know my parents wouldn’t be supportive of this because they don’t believe in me at all.

So, for years I explored and tried different things. In my first year of high school I took an engineering class and decided it wasn't right for me, then realized I should probably stick to the things that I'm good at, which are more art based. I love to write and I'm working on a book, but I'm not expecting good money off of it. It's hard to make enough to live with a book. I continued to explore things I like doing until I finally decided I want a film degree. It's perfect for me since it is artistic, a way of storytelling and mixing aesthetics. An impressive shot from a movie can make me swoon more than any attractive actor can. Obviously I want to be a director, but who doesn't? Realistically, I want to work on ad campaigns for fashion companies (kinda like those gorgeous Dior ads that have nothing to do with the actual product, but they're really pretty and convey moods and make you want to buy it anyway, if that makes sense). 

Sorry if that was a lot/annoying but I wanted to give some background before I talk about this issue. I really wanted to go to film school. I know film is a thing that can be ""self-taught"" and you don't really need to go to school (trust me I've read those forums) for it, but I am the kind of person that learns best when I am being instructed and/or have an organized way of learning something. I've been trying to write a book for like 5 years and it's hard enough, I don't know how I could handle teaching myself a whole new thing you know. I also want access to equipment and connections. I currently live in South Carolina and there are no film schools around. None. There's one in Atlanta, GA but it's not a great school and it's really hard to find reviews and honest feedback about it. Cali is too far, so I've set my eyes on New York. I grew up in Jersey so I'm rather familiar with NY and I have family and friends up there. I'm going to be a senior in high school this year, and my GPA, rank, classes, extracurriculars, etc. are all great. I'm not worried about whether I can get in or not, I probably can, but here it is: WHY THE FUCK IS COLLEGE SO EXPENSIVE???? I literally have no other ""cheap back up schools"" because I can't find any with film degrees. Even if I were to find some, I doubt I could make great connections and get a job. I am SURE this is the only thing I want to major in. Nothing else, and I have done hard research and exploring, appeals to me. Writing is my passion, but I don't want to be an English teacher or write articles for a living. I also know how to write, so why would I get a degree in Creative Writing if I can already successfully creatively write? Film is something that I WANT to learn, something that I can see myself pursuing. If I can't go to film school, I don't know what I want to do. I don't want to go to college if I am going to majoring in something I don't care about. But, not going to college isn't really an option for me either. My family won't accept it, I need a job, and I want to further my education It's so frustrating because there are so many people who don't know what they want to do with their lives. They don't know what their passions are or what their dream job is. But, I KNOW what I want to do.

That’s what I have planned but I already feel mentally and physically exhausted from school and want to take a break but I’m worried about next year. The reason why I wanted to take summer class is because I want a lighter load when I take harder science classes  (like organic chemistry and physics) so I can focus and do better on them.

Dear financial aid committee,

My name is Aliyah C...  recently I've completed my first year at the University of ...... ..... with a set of ups and downs that I've come to learn are life experiences. I'm writing this letter to the committee to explain why I hope to be re-evaluated for financial aid due to not meeting my the satisfactory amount of credits in SAP. Only Haven achieved 50% and not the academic standard of 75%. Though understand how I got in the position I would focus on my first semester mistakes and how corrected them my second semester.

As any first generation college student I went into college hopeful and wanting to make parents proud without taking into account that it would be first time away from my home town in 18 years. This would lead to me having extreme homesickness that haunted over me my first month but I still went to class wanting knowledge it was until my 3 month in I started to develop anxiety and depression that had been left untreated since highschool. With that anxious feeling of not succeeding and gloomy feeling of not having a purpose in life to hold and didn't let go. Though this was happening I still tried to go to the classes that excited me but had stopped going to ones that made me feel worse. By December of 2018 nothing mattered I just wanted to go home and dropout I had stopped going to all classes except 1. The company I kept around weren't ethier with there encouragement to not go. During time confused and didn't know what to do. I had become the this I had ran from my whole life,I was a failure.

I went home that break with 4 F's,1 B, and a 0.38 GPA. I tried to hide my grades from my parents but eventually found out and threaten to withdrawal me. During that month I pleaded for a second chance realizing I didn't want to stop schooling because I loved knowledge and realized me household wasn't a place for me to stay. Eventually I ran off back to school on academic suspension to fix my mistakes and take advantage of what the University offered.

Before Entering my second semester I made sure I applied for classes I enjoyed while also applying for retake classes. When I got back to campus the first thing I did was distance myself from my previous friend group and applied for one on one counseling on campus. From the I made an appointment with my academic advisor to review what need to do to progress In the semester leading me to start going to academic coaching and other tutoring areas around campus. In my semester I learned about balance of school and life and to take responsibility for my actions. In my second semester I went counseling every two weeks, changed my major to something I found better suiting, retained a homework/study , and overcame my doubts about myself so I would go to every class everyday. In my second semester I came with a 2.38 GPA. I was thrilled to the A's and B's I had earned knowing the hard work I put in. I had thought I was good and was able to go back for the fall semester then I realized that I hadn't reach the amount of credits needed for financial aid Haven attempted 13 my first semester passing only 1 classes then attempting 12 my second semester failing only one class. I was angry and devastated and was once again lost. I called my academic advisor to go over what I could do and she told me that would have the opportunity to tell my story to the financial aid board.

A bit of background: I have been suffering from anxiety (and serious low moods) for the most part of the past 4-5 years I guess. Guilt and the feeling that I should just be trying harder stopped me from reaching out, I guess I overcompensated and burnt out. I’ve tried to manage it all myself and whilst I haven’t enjoyed these past years, my grades have rarely suffered (although it’s hard not to wonder how well I could have done had I got this support earlier but hey ho). 

Anyway, it’s been pretty debilitating the past few years at uni. I haven’t really been able to leave my bedroom without having a panic attack or some kind of meltdown so eating and showering and even pissing have become tasks that are hell on earth, I’ve also ended up cutting pretty much everyone important in my life out but I’ve begun working on this one and pretty successfully.

So whilst this seems insignificant for those who are concerned, university is ultimately my main focus here because I put my entire self into it and because I feel like failure is just not an option. I always have managed to pull 1sts/2.1s in assessments despite my practically non-existent university attendance (I honesty don’t know how, I’ve never been super super academic, I work HARD for my grades).
Now despite this hard work, I’m no longer pulling through anymore and it’s been earth shattering.

I can’t get to uni much, I start the school terms off really well, but a panic attack on campus is enough to make me terrified or returning so it’s always a downward spiral. I therefore study almost constantly at home. I keep up with work and I guess the anxiety guilts me out of doing anything else so it’s the only thing I can really do to keep me distracted from the other negative thought patterns. 

Anyway, mental health hit hard with deadline pressure just over a month ago (nothing new but it’s been next level, never saw the terrifying intensity of it all coming). I had been preparing for these end of year essays for months, however I’ve been a zombie-like wreck and a shaking ball of anxiety pretty open to a passive death for months now. I stopped sleeping and eating, I couldn’t read or form sentences so actually working felt impossible. I powered through regardless, but it was all semi non-coherent and just not good. Outside of studying I was delusional and basically thought I was losing my mind. Realised I was at huge risk of doing something stupid and contacted my university to tell them I’ve made the active decision to stop working on my assessments and called the doctors (most terrifying phone call of my life).

My university have reached out and have been supporting me and my health 100%, seriously, they’ve been greater than I ever figured they could be. I feel like I’m not so alone in this now, that I have a system that’s sharing the load, but regardless, figuring out my next steps at uni is overwhelmingly personal. 

I’ve made an extenuating circumstances claim that hopefully allows me to retake or resubmit assessments without the 40% cap in August. I’ve since had two doctors appointments, been referred to a psychologist to start CBT or talking therapy, have started temporary meds to chill my body the fuck out and have a follow up doctors appointment in 10 days to discuss anti-depressants.

Whilst everything bad in me is telling me that I don’t need this level of support right now, all of me realises that I do need some support if uni is going to work out.

So my problem here is the claim. I have 6 days left to provide medical evidence for the claim to even be considered but I just don’t know how to go about asking my doctors practice.  I know I’m blowing this way out of proportion but that’s what I do and I guess I’ll learn how to deal with it soon. 

What kind of evidence do I need? Just a note or a diagnosis? How do I explain the situation? And do I need to tell them what needs to be written on the note or do they already know? Claims are normally made after a sudden and unforeseen incident such as random sickness, injury, family event etc (I’ll try find the exact details), and my university have voiced that my claim is out of the ordinary. But to me this incident was unforeseen, I always manage to pull through, I knew it’d be hard this year but didn’t think it’d be any different, turns out I’m declining and it definitely is ongoing. Will this jeopardise my claim in any way? How much do I need to explain to a doctor? I have an issue of over explaining anyway (obviously lol) but every time I even try to plan what to say my mind blanks!",college,How do I ask my doctor for medical evidence to support my extenuating circumstances claim for not completing end of year assessments due to my mental health condition?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/c1czhs/how_do_i_ask_my_doctor_for_medical_evidence_to/,1560726868.0

I’m currently a sophomore in college studying chemical engineering because I was told that since I was good at math and science, I should major in ChemE. I believed that for a while. I tried joining clubs and talking to professors, but I every time they got to talking about career paths as a ChemE I always zoned out to think about other things that interested me. I figured that it was just my adhd acting up. That it was my fault I couldn’t pay attention while others were readily listening. So I stuck with the major for two years. It has been affecting my grades (having difficulty finding motivation to study), my ability to interact with others (since I can’t find interest in my own major it’s a little hard to find common ground with people within my major), and most importantly it’s been negatively affecting my mental health (I can’t really see a future for myself within chemical engineering, so I’ve been feeling hopeless and depressed).

Recently I started volunteering in lab within my major (still ChemE) which I thought would inspire a desire to go to grad school since I can’t see what I would enjoy doing with just a bachelor’s degree. Again I fell behind because I couldn’t pay attention. And that resulted in me being afraid to ask questions and I kinda started trying to be as invisible as possible, which I think is largely due to social anxiety and a fear of being to harshly judged.

I started seeing a therapist to deal with the social anxiety, and as a result I’ve cared less about how people see me and have become more active within the lab. the last few days I’ve enjoyed it more because I am much more comfortable asking questions and talking to others within the lab since I am less afraid that they see me as baffoon for not paying attention in the earlier weeks. The only problem is, I still can’t bring myself to read more articles and learn more about about what is going on within the lab. I have a much better understanding of the content (so I have the ability to do the readings), but I just can’t find the motivation to do it.

The therapy also got me thinking about why I am so uncomfortable within my major, and got me started thinking about what I am actually interested in. I feel like I am a creative person, and a lot of the time when I am supposed to be paying attention in class, my mind wanders to how I would make a game out of what we’re learning. I took a intro to C++ class a couple semesters ago and I went out of my way to see how many alternative ways I could solve the homework problems rather than following the instructions, and for the most part the class, outside of the lecture, really clicked within my brain. I was never trying to avoid doing the assignments and was always looking for creative ways to complete them. I didn’t tend to zone out while trying to learn either, like I had a habit of doing with chemical engineering.

I also found myself watching a lot of videos on YouTube a while back about timed game making competitions using coding and was really fascinated by the methods the people used to develop their games. 

What I want to do is switch my major from chemical engineering to computer science and specialize in game development but there are 3 problems:

1. I’m already 2 years into chemical engineering, and it’ll probably take 4 additional years to complete a major in  computer science. That’s a lot of time to spend.

2. I am probably one of the more technologically inept people you’ll meet at the moment. The only coding experience I have is a little bit in my first semester, and the intro to C++ class that I mentioned earlier. I get confused easily when people talk about software and how their computer works but I’m willing to ask questions. I’m working on caring less about how people view me and how judgemental they may be. Since I have goals and aspirations I think approaching professors and people already working within the field will be easier than it was in ChemE, which I had a crippling fear of.

3. I also would be walking into the major with a blank resume. Almost none of the stuff that I have done so far relates to video game design, so I’d imagine getting internships or coops related to my field would be difficult as well.  

I’d imagine that making the transition between the two majors would not be smooth at all. There’s a lot of changes that I’ll have to make, but I honestly think it will be worth it if I can be happy doing the career that I end up in. I’m sure that this is what I want to do, the question is how do I go about this transition? Where do I start? I want to try and build my resume as soon as possible I’ll take any help I can get.

Thank you all very much.

In Tunisia we have a system similar to the french system we pass a national exam called baccalaureate and our orientation to the universities depends on our averages. In high school I have selected the branch of economics and management (an easy branch comparing to Maths/  **Letters and Languages**  ) I wasn't so good in high school and we got a big problem in our education called the private tuition and there are some professors who abuse that private tuition and they start giving the necessary applications and explain well in these private tuition than in high school's class to make money and things.... I was against this private learning thing since the beginning and I almost made it through the year without it  until the national exam I did some private tuition to work some good applications and fully understand the lessons etc.. In Tunisia we have average X/20, I was expecting 11 or 12 maximum as an average in the national exam, I was surprised by 14.28/20 Average. So, afterwards I selected one of best universities in management called ""high Commercial Studies Institute"". When I first got into this university I was so excited and I thought that my life would change the whole studies will change and I'll start studying something much more interesting and important. It was totally the opposite stills the same boring thing and it was harder and tougher than the high school studies and It needed so much concentration and hard working. I spent the first 3 months complaining about the professors who don't explain a thing, the lessons are hard, I am not getting what we're learning every session. And the private tuition is much important in this university If I don't study some private lessons I risk to not understand so many subjects or even If I understand them I get 13 maximum because there are tricks that need to be learned in this private lessons and the professors at the university are careless and they don't have a pedagogy and teaching. I started studying before 2 weeks of the exams I didn't pass them well I got 10.24/20 Average. The second semester, I was so careless and each week I say next week I'll start studying until the exams became so close and I was obligated to study Unless I risk to fail the second semester, there is a subject ""Financial Accounting"" coefficient 3 I will get 5 average in it because I didn't study It at all just a day before the exam I checked out some exams and learned how to do some exercises. But I'll be able to get 10 or even 11 average this semester. The problem is that next year will get tougher and harder and the subjects will be solid and tough, like Inferential Statistics which is almost impossible to understand and the professors won't be able to explain it. Financial Management, Management of production, Management, Marketing ETC..   
How can I get motivated next year and start working hard without doing private tuition and understanding the lessons by myself and get an 12 average so that I can get accepted in European University and complete my studies aboard (Masters Degree).",college,My problems at the first year in college.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/bpyz62/my_problems_at_the_first_year_in_college/,1558157733.0
481,lsdn,1557585314,/r/college/comments/bncpjo/i_passed_calculus/,"I know calc 1 is basic stuff for some people, but's been sort of my Everest for a while now. I've always been garbage at algebra. Middle/high school involved almost no productive math education for me. Nothing made sense, no matter how hard I tried. In sophomore year, I got kicked out of school for my garbage math grades and got my GED shortly after.

Eventually, in college, I tried for a liberal arts degree since I'd always been okay at writing. Spent a couple years taking humanities/English/etc. courses. I learned that I really hated writing essays, and couldn't possibly fathom a future for myself in those types of fields.

I spent a couple years contemplating what the hell I wanted to do. I was always pretty good at science, so I decided to pursue a biology degree. Of course, the obvious problem here was that I would need to take math classes.

So, I started in the Fall of 2017 taking rudimentary pre-algebra/algebra 1. At first, I had no idea what the fuck I was doing. The most basic concepts that I never managed to learn, like solving a linear equation, still evaded me. After a while of feeling like an absolute moron and beating my head against a wall, something clicked. Shit started to make sense, finally. I passed that class with an A, as well as the following two algebra classes. I passed pre-calc last semester with a C. The professor was not great and wrote the most garbage, unrepresentative tests imaginable. I'm usually not one to blame a prof, but he seriously made his class needlessly obtuse.

Finally, this semester, I enrolled in calc 1. I was unbelievably anxious for the entire semester. I didn't wanna fail and lose my financial aid. The first test went well; got an 85. The next two tests, though? High D's, and the two after that were mid C's. This was all despite studying at least 15 hours a week. Some things just weren't clicking, unfortunately. In the end, though, concepts built upon themselves enough to the point that shit started getting easy.

Going into the final, I still had a high C in the class due to 100% grades from homework and a project. I needed an 80 on the final to get a B in the class, thanks to the fact that our grade on the final would replace our lowest test grade. I studied my ass off, making sure I understood every type of problem and how it related to the overarching concepts. Went into that final feeling confident as hell, and walked out feeling the same. I got a fucking 93. My final grade in the class is an 85. If you told me that would happen to my high school self, or even myself from a year and a half ago or January of this year, I would have heavily doubted you. I've been dreading this class since I started this degree. Like, dozens of hours of worrying and stressing this semester alone. It's been like a ghost lurking over my shoulder, taunting my inadequacy and making me doubt my future since I was 12.

And, just like that, I'm done with math.  That's all biology requires, unless I decide to go into biotech, biochem, or micro/molecular bio, which require calc 2 at some schools. I'm in love with biology and chemistry, and now I'm free to explore them without anxiety.

Sorry for giving y'all my life story. I'm just excited that I managed to bite the bullet and do this.

I was wondering if anyone can help me with my situation atm. I know that ultimately its my decision but I kind of want some other opinion.

A little bit about me, I'm 23, male, currently in my senior year in college, but I'm basically part time student and full time developer.

So, in April 2017 I started learning Web development, both front end and back end. Then in Aug 2017 I started doing some freelance work. It was ok, not really something I could live off of. So I was basically still living with my parents. From Aug 2017 to Nov 2018, I was basically just living off my parents and making side money doing freelance, and was working Part time at a pharmacy. The pay was pretty good, something I could live off of but I only worked on the weekends. So all this on top of going to school full time 15hr semesters. So Nov 2018 I had a rough month, only had one client and only got paid 80 dollars. Towards the end of NOV 2018 I had to start preparing for finals so i couldnt take anymore clients. But a really lucky thing happened to me. One day, I decided to go to campus to the CS Lab to finish a JAVA Calendar app. And by finish, I mean start it (it was due that day at 6:30pm). So as I was doing the project, a guy (prob around 28yrs old I think), Went up to me and asked if I could help him with the same project. And I did, was simple enough, But he was having a hard time understanding it so I explained it to him best I could. We talked a lot, and I remember him asking me how I knew those stuff already, and he seemed lost in the class. Then I explained to him how I have been coding in C++ since I was a sophomore in highschool, but when I got to college my parents wanted me to major in nursing because it was a ""Stable"" job. And I did that for 3 years and Absolutely hated it. I found myself skipping classes to go do practice coding or start a new project. So I recently switched majors into CS. I also mentioned to him that I had been doing freelance web dev since Aug 2017 and that my favorite languages were C++ and javascript. In the end, Turns out we were in the Same OOP class, who knew?

Fast forward a week later, the last week of NOV. I meet the same guy in class and he asks me if I was looking for a project. I told him I wasn't because finals coming up, but if it was worth it, Ill take it. Then he explained everything to me.

Turns out he works as an IT for a Real estate company that was looking to re build their website. So I took the project! ofc.

Worked a total about 2 weeks in December and got paid 2k dollars. Was a good month for me. So on the last day when they payed me the CEO actually wanted to meet with me. And Turns out He graduated in the same college as I'm currently in. And he knew another CEO that is looking for a web developer. So he referred me. I went through 3 interviews, 1 call, 1 personality one, and 1 whiteboard interview. And I got in! TBH I thought I had bombed those interviews. I've been working with them ever since, as a REMOTE full stack developer. DEC 2018 - now so almost 6 months already. And I have since moved out and live with myself now.

Now my situation is, This semester, I work full time remotely 8-5. And go to class 6:30-9:30pm. This was very taxing and almost couldnt take it. I had to drop half of my classes just so I could keep my sane. But about halfway throughout the semester I noticed that even if I went to class. I would just work on some personal web projects in class, So I decided not go to class anymore - Probably a huge mistake. Anyway, now finals is next week, and I already know I can only get an F in all of my 3 classes. EVEN if I make 100 on each of them. Now I know I'm going to fail this semester. My GPA since this semester was 3.9 out of 4. I know it'll affect my GPA but tbh I don't care anymore. I'm more concerned because I'm essentially moving my graduation date back by a semester. And my parents expect me to graduate This AUG 2019 and I don't want them to think that I am a disappointment or a failure because I didn't graduate college. All my friends are graduating this month, albeit, they don't have anything lined up after that though. So what are your thoughts? what should I do? should I just focus on work? Should I refocus on school?

FYI: in my parents eyes, if you don't have a degree, you're basically a failure that works at mcdonalds or target all your life. And I've tried telling them that it doesn't matter. But they never believe it. They thought that I was lying about my work because I would be at home in front of the computer all day and have youtube or music running on my second screen.

TL:DR

Pushed graduation back a semester because I'm gonna fail this semester because I took a Remote Dev full time Job. Moved out of my parents house.

484,bettermentboss,1557269990,/r/college/comments/blxkjd/7_honest_things_i_wish_i_knew_before_i_started/,"So you don’t want to spend $25,000 a year for college just to mess it up and have your life ruined? Great, let me share with you 7 honest things I wish I knew before I started college:

Number 1: You’re going to have to figure things out yourself

In college, there is no more hand holding and this means that your learning will entirely rely upon you. My experience was that in college, once you paid your tuition, having professors care about your academic success is rare, meaning that if you are struggling, you need to find ways to help yourself out. I remember starting university here in Canada and feeling totally overwhelmed in class and when I tried to talk to the professor, he would never make the time to go through my questions leaving me to have to work with his assistants in order to get the support I needed. Therefore, the first thing to know when starting college is that you will have to rely upon yourself in order to succeed.

Number 2: Networking is key

Sure, you signed up for college to party…I mean get a degree well one thing you cannot neglect is networking. Now, I know it is tough. As students, we are in a constant cycle of being bombarded by readings and assignments followed by midterms and finals which leaves little time to consider employment related activities. However, do you want to me the only one of your friends who graduates with no job prospects because you didn’t take the time to build relationships with employers? Therefore, the second thing to know is that networking should be prioritized when in college.

Number 3: Resourcefulness equals success

Honestly, I am not the smartest dude but I am probably one of the most resourceful. Being resourceful for me meant having a few high performing students in each class I could depend on for help on assignments when needed or to have available if I was given a group project to tackle. Alternatively, being resourceful also meant leveraging the school’s free services like resume writing workshops and networking fairs to help me find the best jobs possible. Therefore, the third thing you must know in order to succeed in college is how to leverage the resources around you.

Number 4: You will be judged based on your major

In high school, you were judged for just about everything but lucky for you, in college you will only be judged by one thing: your major. For me, I was always called a bean counter or a numbers nerd by my friends for being in accounting but guess is asking for tax help now…yeah you guessed it! Regardless of what program you are in, as long as you enjoy the subject and see a career path that will result from your hard work then don’t worry when people pass judgment on what major you chose.

Number 5: College is a precious time in your life

College is a fantasy land. You can sleep in during the middle of the week and any night is a good night to party. With that being said, college is still stressful and something you shouldn’t take lightly, but when in college, appreciate being able dedicate yourself to your studies and enjoy the lack of responsibilities that will soon enter your life once you start your career.

Number 6: Your grades don’t matter as much as you think

Sure, you’d love to bring home a good grade for your mom to put on the fridge but in reality your grades in college don’t matter as much as you think. My personal stance on grades in college is that you should try your best get the best marks possible but not at the expense blocking out all the other positive aspects. For instance, if you never attend social events, network or exercise then you are doing yourself a disservice because those grades you are striving to obtain probably won’t mean anything to you in the future. Therefore, the sixth thing you should know before starting college is that your grades matter but they aren’t everything. 

Number 7: Picking a major based on future earnings is wrong

We all want to make it rain but at what expense? I feel fortunate that my career as an accountant has been very enriching but for a surprisingly high amount of graduates, their field of work is not as satisfying as they would have imagined even if it is paying them a fair sum of money. I feel strongly that you should follow your passion when deciding on a major in college because if you love what you do then you will surely become good enough at your craft to support yourself financially. Conversely, if you choose a major based on salary, you may be financially solid but dread each and every day you have to work making your career one long slog. So if you’re deciding on a major right now, keep in mind potential earnings but prioritize your passion for the subject if you want to maximize what you get out of college.

Been going to CC for a long time and have finally made it to my last class. It's an Applied Calculus class which i've been putting off for as long as possible because i'm terrible at math.

The situation is this and i'd like advise on how to handle it. There was some oversight within regards to our 1st professors hours and they had to switch him out 3/4 of the way through the semester. I had a B with the old professor and had it very easy with his teaching methods and his testing.

After the swap, the new professor is a good professor, but i simply couldn't adapt to his tests. His tests were significantly more difficult and regardless of how hard i tried to study and follow his teachings, his tests were still foreign and i did exceptionally poorly.

I had went from a B in the class to a dumpster fire and i'm honestly beside myself because i did my absolute best. I feel that an injustice was done to me and i shouldn't be held responsible for this. (I am not the only one in the class who had done terrible, all my 5 other classmates did bad as well).

I had emailed the Dean several weeks ago expressing my concerns and informed him this is my very last course and i'm not thrilled that this oversight is going to cost me getting my degree this semester. Essentially, he said ask questions and figure it out and that they had no other choice.

Is there anything I can do? My degree is in IT, i don't have to take a math course again, and i don't feel like i should have to pay for another course that i failed mostly because of an oversight by the school.

I don't have time to get into all the details but I have been screwing up my education at an elite private college since my freshman year. I've already taken a semester off and have also taken so many incompletes. When I turn in the work I do exceptionally well and I've even won awards but I also don't turn in all of my work and everyone has tried to help me over and over and I just cannot do it. Last semester I plagiarized my final paper and received an F for the class. I'm on academic probabtion but still failing. I'm trying so hard and nothing seems to be going right in so scared. 

My mental health is going to hell and I've been avoiding dealing with it. My self esteem is so low and my anxiety is so crippling I am paralyzed. I'm not trying to excuse my horrible behavior but I come from a highly dysfunctional and abusive family. I was molested by my biological father and grandfather and verbally abused by my mentally ill mother. I was then raped again as an adult. I've not been able to see a therapist for any of this. I've been to therapy a couple times but for one reason or another we have had to stop.

This semester in particular has been horrible as more memories of molestation as a child at the hands ignore my father have resurfaced and taken over my life. I'm going insane just trying to make it through the day. I am in crisis and I am avoiding all of my work and even though everyone at college is trying to help me succeed I've screwed them over by missing appointments and not turning in the bare minimum even after they have given me second chances. I feel really unable to cope. I cannot be in college right now yet it is the only thing that brings me joy in this dark time. And I am so terrified of my family I am panicking about the end of the semester. I cannot even defend myself a little bit for my school failure since I cannot just tell my mother that I've been having intrusive thoughts about my father molesting me (she saw him do it once anyway and didn't do anything so she probably would deny it if I told her now, just as she blamed me for getting raped as an adult). 

I am working this summer in my home state and living with my mother. We have always been ""best friends"" but she is personality disordered and has a history of violence and is frankly very terrifying and abusive to me. Given that my poor mental health is one of the reasons I am struggling to concentrate and complete my work I don't know how I can return home. She will almost certainly yell at and beat me for what happened at school this semester and all the lies I've been telling her.

I know what I did was stupid and I know what I should have done was tell the truth and get help earlier and not plagiarize, etc.

But as it is now I don't know what to do. Should I suck it up and live with my mom? Should I take a leave of absence (if I don't totally kicked out). I have no friends or family that I can think of to stay with. My life feels ruined.

At first I thought that maybe I'd find myself, and use some time to figure out what I wanted to do at CC (Community college) but it didn't go that way. 

My gpa(computer science) is terrible and I didn't figure that out today- I knew all along. I talked with some advisors about whether I should've dropped out in the middle of this spring semester but I got the positive pep talk and now I'm looking at a 2.3 this sophomore year. I have tons of b's, 3 c's and 2 f's, 1 A. I haven't even gotten to my core classes yet. The f I did get was in psychology class and math class...intermediate because I didn't attend the final, so it costs me 50% of my grade. This will be my third 4th time retaking math and actually receiving a grade for it because I got withdrawn so many times. It's not that I am terrible at math, I just don't study. I have understood the steps and everything but I fail due to lack of studying. I only have two or one more chance to retake a course and my financial aid will go away. If I fail anything else, I'll get kicked from financial aid too. I can barely get a job now and I fear if I live college I'll never get up and go back, which is what happened with my brother. My brother left after his first semester of college and now just going back at the age of 28. I'm not very smart, I've realized. I can only learn so much before I drop the subject because it got too hard or required practice. I don't have anything else that I'm good at. If I continue college, by transferring to my state school, I'd just began learning actual programming languages. I also thought about attending summer school, but I don't even know anymore. 

I could change my major, but I don't know what else I'd want to go for. I tried biology with hopes to become pre med once I transferred but that's nowhere possible now. Plus, a lot of my classmates were smarter and took the class apart from their university courses- so I felt tremendously horrible. I had realized I lacked the intellect, and the course wasn't stereotypically easy like most people would guess coming from community college.

As a matter of fact, I don't even know why I went from stem to another stem major since it seems I'm bad at maths, sciences etc. I guess due to the saying, ""stem or it's not worth it"".

This is a story about how this spring semester, I got straight A’s in 20 credits worth of classes while also working part time, volunteering, securing a summer internship, trying not to neglect my relationships, exercising daily, and getting 8 hours of sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not trying to “flex” \*hello fellow kids\*, but I see a lot of people asking for advice, especially new students, wondering if their credit load will overwhelm them.  I hope this helps someone.  \*\*\*TDLR at the bottom\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**A Brief History:**

I am a 25 yo female who just finished my “Junior” year of undergrad. “Junior” because it was my fourth year of college and I have a ton of credits, but I still have a full academic year before I graduate. After high school, I dragged ass and essentially failed out after two years of an unrelated degree (art), took three years off, then went back two years ago for my current degree.

When I left school, I was absolutely convinced that I was dropping out of college, not taking a break. I had anxiety attacks before attending class, felt extremely lost, could barely pay attention in lecture, and struggled with substance abuse. I finished my last semester with a semester GPA of 1.9 and a total GPA of 2.5. Yikes. 

In high school, I was one of those “gifted” but burnt out kids. My teachers always said I was smart, but it was such a shame that I refused *apply* myself. After taking a break from school and doing some soul searching, I decided: I’m a fucking adult, I’m going back to college, for real this time. I’m going to apply my goddamn self. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**About my degree:**

I’m studying public health. To me, my degree is the perfect mix of “hard science” classes and humanities classes. I take classes in the realm of microbiology, A&amp;P, epidemiology, anthropology, sociology, and ethics. The mix of memorization-style studying and critical thinking, writing essays and discussion style work makes it so that I’m never bored. (I go to a large state school in the northwest U.S. if that matters to you). 

This is the part where someone butts in and says you could never do this with a STEM degree. Sure. Probably not. I’m not saying that every person regardless of major should take my advice, just trying to share what I have learned. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The Decision:**

I do a little mental checklist before I assemble a semester’s worth of classes (because advisors are useless- you already *know*). This particular semester, it just somehow worked out that I wasn’t going to be taking any classes that required large amounts of difficult studying. I don’t mean work, but *studying.* That is not to say that I didn’t do any work. I still had shit to do. Readings to skim, essays to write, research to do, the works. But I didn’t really *study*, which takes up a lot more abstract time than *doing.* 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**My Classes:** 

I took 4 three credit courses and 2 four credit courses. All but two of my courses were 400 level classes with a significant amount of work. (If you’re curious: 3 credit 200 level medical anthropology and a 3 credit 100 level earth science class- my last core requirement)

I like to breakdown my classes at the beginning of the semester based on how difficult I deem them to be. You can usually figure this out by the first couple weeks of class, or after the first graded assignment. How much work will this require time-wise and brain-power-wise, and how big of a hardass grader is the prof? THIS is a big deal. Once I figured this out, college seemed so much more like a game. I would highly recommend doing this, you can reassess throughout the semester and as you learn more about your own grade in the class. I typically write my courses on a sticky note in order of priority and slap it in my planner. Speaking of which:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Planner set up:**

I need a paper planner. It’s absolutely non-negotiable. I could not survive college without one, and you shouldn’t try to. I bring it everywhere. I’ve tried bullet journaling, keeping a to-do list in a notebook, google calendar- none of them compare to the ease of use and accuracy of a paper planner. A typical week in mine looks like [this!](https://imgur.com/a/r5qhd0i)

&amp;#x200B;

At the beginning of the semester, I write the time every class takes place in my weekly spread A4 Target planner. Then, I go through the syllabus and enter every single thing next to when it is due. For each week of the semester, I have two sticky notes on the page. I do this because inevitably things get moved around. In my photo, you can see that the smaller yellow note is for readings, and the large pink one is my ongoing to-do list. The readings being separate is important because otherwise everything gets clogged up, and I can see at a glance what I need to read (or skim, or pretend to have read). I organize my to-do list by class, and have a section for “life”. The first thing I do every morning is look at my planner, and it’s one of the last things I look at before I go to bed. As soon as I sit down in class, I open it up. When making plans with a friend, I open it up. I can’t overstate this enough. Get a planner and use the shit out of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Work:** 

I had the unique situation of not having to work that much this semester. I received a federal grant that paid for most of my tuition, scholarships paid for the rest, and my family helps me out with part of my living expenses. This is obviously not everyone’s reality.

The last three semesters, I have worked up to 30 hours each week, and it really is fucking hard. Working takes up a lot of your time and energy, and I wouldn’t recommend working while taking this heavy of a course load. 

That being said, I did still work. I like working. I like having money, I like the structure and I like having something productive besides school to do. In the past, I was an assistant teacher at a private preschool. This semester, I was lucky enough to be able to substitute teach at least one 6 hour shift each week because of my school schedule (Fridays off, Thursdays half off). I also babysat a couple of nights each week pretty consistently. This ended up being about 10-15 hours a week of work- an easy couple hundred bucks in my pocket for rent and nights out. The best part about this situation is that if I was really swamped, I could just completely opt out of work or not schedule anything. When I wasn’t busy with school, I could put in a 20 hour workweek. It put me in control.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Volunteering:**

I taught adaptive skiing on Sundays. I ski with an 8-year-old girl with Down syndrome, and it is exhausting, but rewarding. Our days consisted of me chasing after her, singing songs, managing tantrums, and hoisting her up off the snow. I laughed a lot. Despite thinking that I might over-stretch myself at the beginning, this experience was additive to my life. I felt refreshed, motivated, and happy because I had this kind of volunteering in my schedule. I include this not to brag, but to recommend some type of meaningful volunteering or work if you can. If you think you’re too busy to do good things in the world, you’re not. Promise. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Relationships:**

You know the triangle. Choose one: sleep, get A’s, or have a social life.

Here’s the thing. I’m 25. Sort-of non-traditional, but I’m still in my twenties. I still have friends who like to go out, still go to shows, stay up too late, etc. But, my friends are also adults. None of my friends who are nurses, teachers, or baristas want to go out until midnight on a Thursday anymore. None of my non-student friends are free in the middle of the day to go fuck around or distract me. When I tell my friends I can’t come out because I’m studying, they’re not giving me shit for it. 

I still made a point to set aside time on Saturday’s to spend time with my friends. Typically we would ski, go out for coffee, or make each other breakfast.  

Another factor in this realm is my boyfriend. Boyfriend works 9-5, so my motivation to not do any schoolwork after dinner was intensified in order to hang out with my person. Boyfriend makes me dinner on nights that I have class until 8pm. Boyfriend gets toilet paper at the store because I’m stuck in the library.  Boyfriend wakes me up with coffee telling me he is proud of me. Can you tell that my love language is acts of service?

I’m not telling you to ignore your friends if they’re distracting and get a partner who does stuff for you, but to consider which relationships in your life are additive and which are less so. It’s fine to have fun and make memories; you’re in college. But if you say yes to every single opportunity, you will find yourself out of balance.

My point here with relationships is this: make sure the people who love you know what is going on with you. Let them know that you want to hang out, but you’re reaching for your goals.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Work Ethic:**

For me, relying on motivation alone has never helped me. I need to “hack” my environment in order to do what I need to do. 

I woke up at 6:30 every single day, including weekends. On weekdays, I would arrive on campus around 7:45 and either go to class or go to the library. The quiet floor or the law library are clutch. No coffee shops, no cafeteria, no house. If there is any ambient noise or people having conversations around me, I cannot function. I am there to do work and focus. If you’re only half-working, you’re spending twice the amount of time on work. I straight up didn’t have the time to only half-work.

In a typical day, I will sit down at a desk, open up my planner and my laptop, decide which item on my to-do list is the perfect combination of “finishability” and time-urgency.  My phone is on grey-scale and I deleted my social media apps this January and haven't looked back. I listen to 432 Hz white noise music in noise-cancelling earbuds. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m very bad at time. My brain does not conceptualize it passing. I wear a watch religiously, and set timers for everything- Otherwise I get sucked into the hyper-focus wormhole. I set a ten minute timer to get set up and decide what to do, otherwise I will agonize about what the “perfect” thing to do is. Then, I set a timer for 30 minutes, and lean into whatever I have decided to do. After this, I take a break, walk around, take my earbuds out, get some water or coffee, but do not turn my phone back on. And repeat. Before I know it, my work is done or it is time to go to class.

&amp;#x200B;

If I don’t have anything to do, but it is still “work” time, I will research grad programs, apply for internships, go to professors office hours, or read about work that people I admire do. This paid off in the end of the semester, as a professor casually mentioned that I would get along well with another professor in a different department. I meet up with Prof #2, she was impressed that I had already read about her work and offered me a paid summer internship. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Exercise:** 

Exercise is another non-negotiable in my life. I have border-collie level energy. I need to exercise. If I’m feeling overwhelmed, tired, or stuck, a run almost always helps. I lift weights 4 days a week, my routine usually takes about an hour. I either Nordic or downhill ski with my friends on Saturdays, volunteer on Sundays, and have two hours of yoga a week built into my schedule. No exercise = poor sleep = too tired to workout = eat like crap = I can’t focus= I get overwhelmed= whole system falls apart. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**What I did that actually helped me succeed.** 

* Campus library is my “office” from 8-5 every single weekday. 
* Paper planner is your BIBLE.
* Delete social media. Turn off your phone. Really.
* Work in chunks. For my brain, 30 minutes with a timer and then a small break is ideal. 
* Prioritize, prioritize prioritize. You’re going to have to bullshit some assignments and toil over others. Make your efforts count.
* If you don’t think you have any school work to do at any given time, you’re wrong. You can always work ahead. 
* Habits trump motivation every time. Motivation wanes, but if you’re in the groove, you’re way less likely to fall behind. 
* Never. Ever. Ever. Skip. Class. 
* This seems obvious, but do every single assignment and every single extra credit opportunity, no matter how minuscule or annoying. 
* Support system. Tell your friends &amp; family what you’re trying to achieve and let them know how they can *help* you.
* Don’t forget to feed yourself and exercise.
* Set aside intentional time for non-school. Ideally a full day on the weekend. 
* Say no. Say NO. Explain yourself, be kind, but say fucking no. 
* Nobody is productive every single hour of every day. It’s ok. Perfect is truly the enemy of the good. 
* Have an end goal. Visualize walking at graduation. See your GPA climb.
* If you’re a non-traditional age considering going back to school- do it. School is infinitely easier with an adult brain, adult friends, and adult priorities. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, if you fucked up this semester, its ok. It really is. I’ve been there. My sophomore year, I ended the spring semester with one D, two Cs, an F and a W. It doesn’t feel good. Just remember that it doesn’t say anything about your worth as a person. Beating yourself up about it isn't going to help in the long run. You are not forever the person who fucked up, and you can use what you did wrong to learn and grow and change. 

Also, remember that succeeding and trying your best doesn’t have to be miserable. You can still enjoy the things that bring meaning to your life while trying to do something difficult.

489,wyliejae,1556732429,/r/college/comments/bjk1ce/need_advice_on_next_steps/,"Hey everyone,

I'll be a Junior next year in the fall at my university. I'm currently in a Materials Science and Engineering program, which I transferred into last semester. I am a little behind in the curriculum as there are a few prerequisite classes I still have to take. I figured I would end up in college for an additional semester or two, but this didn't really bother me because I thought I could fit in some certificates and a minor that interested me. I was planning on taking a few credits over the summer to catch up a little. 

However, the issue that is really stressing me out stems from my poor performance in undergrad thus far. My GPA is a 2.8. I know I have the ability to do better, and this year I told myself I would totally fix my grades and boost my GPA. I spent countless hours trying to prepare for the future semester. I researched practically every way under the sun that has been described as ways to be a better student and to be more motivated. I honestly think something is wrong with my brain or personality, because despite everything I still seem to fall back into my old habits. I always fail. At this point, I'm just tired physically and emotionally of being a constant failure. I really thought I could change but it feels hopeless. Every move I make to better myself, it seems like I launch myself backwards regardless. 

I am filled with constant regret and I feel ashamed. I don't know what I have to do to fix myself. I just want to feel happy, fulfilled, and proud of myself. I haven't felt that way since I graduated high school. I don't know whether to keep pushing forward or to try and take a semester off and figure things out. 

I thought I was going to do so well this semester. I even managed to convince my one professor to let me conduct original research. For awhile, it seems like I can try to bullshit my way through college and pretend to be a good student and a hard worker. When it comes down to it, I really just feel like I don't belong. 

I currently live with family and commute to classes about an hour a day. Tried making friends because I know my grades improve when I socialize with others. I even got an executive director position in a club I joined. I feel like some aspects of my life are improving, but in the ones that matter I am stagnant.

490,DustyMan34,1556695470,/r/college/comments/bjedbx/have_a_nerdy_friend_who_wants_to_do_nothing/,"Before I get started with the story, I just want to clarify that I am NOT against people studying or anything like that. My friend is just extremely excessive about it and I don’t know how to get him to stop. 

So I met this guy a couple of months ago in one of my classes (we’ll call him B). Now, B’s a friendly guy. Quiet and very introverted, but a really friendly dude. We quickly became friends and he’s someone I enjoy hanging out with as he’s usually really happy and chill. He’s also insanely analytical and impressively smart as well. Unfortunately, this doesn’t translate well to his lack of social skills.

I’ve invited him to come along with me to a few house parties and he usually just sits in a chair and doesn’t say much. I’ve tried to introduce friends of mine to him and even help guide the conversations towards similar interests but he shuts down pretty quickly and we end up usually leaving hours before the party is even over. One time when we were leaving, I asked him one time how he was tired so early and all he said was “Im not tired. It’s just after a while at places like this I start getting in my feelings and want to leave.” I’m assuming this was because of the fact that he doesn’t engage himself in social situations that much and got jealous, but I wasn’t sure and didn’t press on.

Now, the main thing that bugs me is the fact that he is so overly analytical and cautious that he ends up spending almost ALL of his free time studying. He doesn’t have a job (which is totally fine! I don’t either), but yet has no free time to hang out. Last week, I wanted to hangout with him last Friday night and grab dinner, but he said he was gonna be busy all weekend. Tuesday class comes around and I ask what he did. His answer? “I studied 10 hours on Friday, 9 hours on Saturday, and 5 hours on Sunday and went home to see my family”. Mind you, this was for a simple exam. So I go “Dang! Huge exam? That’s too much studying!” and he goes “Yeah it’s not too big of an exam but I knew if I didn’t study a lot I would worry too much.”

Now, I know you’re thinking “He’s probably just saying that because he doesn’t want to hangout.” But he’ll even snap me pics of him studying throughout the day and does a lot of other things that further verify my theory that he’s a chronic worrier.

For example, he’s taking a 2-week summer class in 3 weeks (an Economics class). The class hasn’t even started yet, but yet he always planned out his routine and told me everything; The class starts at 8 am and goes 5 days a week. He’s going to wake up at 5:30 AM each day (he’s ALREADY going to bed at 8:30 PM each night including weekends to prepare for this), get ready and commute the 20 minutes to school getting him there around 7 because he doesn’t want to deal with rush hour (we live in a city in the southern part of Kansas, traffic isn’t bad here). He’ll then wait around for an hour studying until class starts. He even went on to tell me that he got the study guides for all the tests for the class already and was going to memorize all of them before the class even starts! We’re 3 weeks away, but he’s already visibly worried about how he’ll cope with it.

Maybe I’m overreacting a bit, but I’m worried that B has some kind of mental disorder that causes him to freak out about any and all tasks he needs to do (like take a test) and extremely over prepare for the material. This happens so much so that he barely has time for any social gatherings as it’s typically a struggle to plan to do anything with him. I’ve talked with him about it and he’s hinted at the fact that he doesn’t like studying all the time (hence his comment about getting “in his feelings” at parties). I don’t know what to tell him as this is a hard subject to talk about due to the fact that he takes everything personally and would likely get offended if I called him out on it. 

I’m just not sure what to do as I like B, but find it almost impossible to find time to hangout with him. Any suggestions?",college,Have a nerdy friend who wants to do nothing besides study.

Not to brag, but just so you get an idea, I was accepted to study at Oxford University next year (just though study abroad but still quite competitive).

Yet I feel like that just makes me all the more of a fuck up. I am extremely, extremely behind-- basically failing -- in all my classes and life. Failing, as in, despite all the generous extensions I've received, I still have three weeks to complete basically an entire semester's worth of work. 

That's the biggest issue but on top of this I haven't been taking my antidepressants for a week or so because I just forgot and then I just kept not taking them I don't even know why? And because I'm procrastinating with money stuff and can't find the energy to walk to bank and then the pharmacy I've been going without my ADHD meds for a couple days and using caffeine to compensate. I have missed so many doctor's appointments that I needed to go to. I am also, I believe, a bit of a kleptomaniac (or maybe I'm just a conscience-less asshole) and stole some small things like lipstick from my best friend (she knows we chatted about it and she forgave me) but I recently did it again and she found it and somehow forgave me but I still feel like shit and don't feel like I deserve or can reciprocate her friendship. And I've stolen other things, like clothes lying around campus, foreign money I found in a purse in the lost and found and even books from the library because my account is frozen from lost items and I guess I have no conscience about stealing old books no one reads anyways (except I do feel bad after the fact, sorta..) it's going to catch up with me and I don't even need things!!!! I'm a disaster human and for a long time know one knew but now I feel like my mask isn't slipping and the shame is unbearable.

I owe money to a bunch of different places and people and have an overdue rental laptop I'm too afraid to return because of how late it is. I have it and don't need it but the thought of facing them, after how many emails and calls they've made, and sheepishly being like ""here it is"" makes me want to die. I literally want someone to return it for me! This is so ducking stupid. I also have an overdue tab from on campus cafe from last year! They've been pestering me to pay it (it's like $50 dollars) for like a year but I never have the money and hate asking my parents for help.

To make matters much worse I lost my debit card a over month ago and am too scared now to call and get a new one because what even do I say? I lost this A MONTH AGO? I never even told them to freeze it (the account was zero anyways so I thought it didn't matter). I'm also procrastinating on that because I'd to tell my mom (they have to ship out first to her address) and that is always so shame inducing and stressful.

More ways I'm a fuck up: I haven't recorded the hours I've worked. Partially because I'm too forgetful and/or lazy and embarrassed to ask my boss for retro hours. I desperately need the money, though, and have been selling my clothes to get money to pay for things/bills. I also haven't bothered with it because it goes directly into my credit card which, as you know, I lost a month ago and haven't dealt with. And the class dean keeps calling me because I'm sure my professors have been emailing her (it's a small school where profs notice and care about students, another reason I feel so guilty for letting them down). And of course I am avoiding the dean too because the idea of visiting someone who know how badly I've fucked up scares the shit out of me. I just want to get my shit together a little before I talk to her bt I've been saying that for a month. Any progress I make is so minimal. Like I seem to take three days to just ORGANIZE my planner. Or get everything together and make the calls so I can walk to go and get my ADHD meds? That takes a whole damn day. Not kidding. Now imagine a 7 page paper? Well, two days needed to get everything ready: find the money to buy caffeine pills so I can actually have energy to write, figure out how to steal appropriate library books, ask friend to meet me somewhere to give me the assignment because I lost it and deleted the email on accident, borrow/rent a laptop because I don't own one, walk to library only find out it it closed on the weekends, try to work in dorm but it's too loud, explain to your friends and boyfriend why you never have time to hang out, try to figure out what to write about, have a meltdown, write reddit post because of meltdown, etc etc. Then the writing stage starts and I am writing a the speed of a snail. My eyes hurt and I need a break after spending three hours on a couple sentences, having scoured the thesaurus because none of the words work...

I feel so guilty for throwing away this opportunity, again, especially when so many people are trying to help me. This has happened before too. It's not like I'm a first year. I'm a junior! I feel like I'm letting everyone down again and again. And I want so bad to make them respect me and be prof of me so when I'm talking to them, especially my favorite professor, who honestly loves me because we are just really close and I'm super enthusiastic and smart in his subject. I know he must be getting sick of my excuses/lies, though. I always make promises about turning in stuff that I know I can't keep, just to make him happy and not annoyed and mad in the moment. Like I just say what people want to hear instead of the truth. And then I let them down and feel horrible. And no one trusts me and they shouldn't because I am the least trustworthy and honest person alive and I want to stay in bed and avoid everyone forever.

The worst part is the shame and avoidance and web of lies I've spun. I don't even know how many people I have been lying to so many people I can't keep track.

I probably haven't even mentioned half of the ways I've fucked up lately. This feels like beyond ADHD. It feels like madness. And the lying and hiding and avoiding is about to backfire real hard. I've been daydreaming about suicide to be honest.

I have tried to start therapy again this semester, by the way. But when I went in it was to focus on childhood trauma, a sexual assault as an adult and--mainly-- a childhood sexual abuse/incest situation because I have trouble with sex and with my boyfriend. It would have helped probably but I can't even make my appointments I'm too lazy. That and the fact that's when I start to talk about that stuff it consumes every waking thought and I need to get work done. I'm a very good student sometimes, like I win awards for research and stuff, so my professors have been very understanding. But that can only go so far. I have to turn something in eventually and my brain just feels broken. It can't do anything. But I always feel like this and it has happened again and again and I never seem to improve so how can anyone trust or respect me?

My mom is going to be so mad at me. I will have to stop lying and tell her everything about school. And she will be upset and yell at me, which is normal and expected, but it will be so hard to listen to go on and on and on with the yelling and lecturing me about how hard I make HER life without just shouting at her that I was fucking molested by my dad and never told her, and never will, because I know it will ruin her life!

But at the end of the day it all comes down to me. I'm a liar. And lazy. And cannot be trusted. It will take a lot of work to gain back the respect of everyone.

I have tried and failed many times throughout my college career to find a place where I’m actually free from distraction.

I try the library, and there are people having loud conversations not related to school that carry around the entire floor. In my room, either my roommates or people in rooms nearby blast music, yell, slam doors, and generally never shut up.

I am having a lot of trouble understanding what went wrong here but I feel like when you are in question for any type of plagiarism etc, its always hard to convince anyone without it sounding like an excuse.

Few months back, I wrote a make up test for my course and the test would be held online. Fast forward, I have constantly tried to reach out to the professor in regards to any update with my mark for this test but she never responded. I eventually went to speak to her after my final exam where she insisted that there were issues with uploading the grades. Weeks later, I get my mark back and Ive completely failed the course. I have been doing fairly well in this course and the only way to have failed was to get a 0 on this mid term. Once again, tried to reach out to the prof for clarification and have not gotten a response. I decided to take it to the next level and ask other people to assist me with this issue and later realized my grade was removed. Everything was raising red flags at this point. I had emailed an advisor in regards of this and had my issue forwarded to the department. I followed up with the appropriate staff and was later told that i was being investigated for an academic misconduct. 

No details what so ever. I am having such a hard time with this matter. On our school website, an instructors first step would have been to request to meet with me to discuss of this matter before submitting anything to the deans. However i was never given that chance to understand what had went wrong and it has always been me reaching out to her with no attention from her side. Now i am expected to meet with the deans, completely blinded. 

Can someone explain how one can be in question for academic misconduct for an online test? I genuinely did not do anything wrong and I dont know how else to prove it without them pressing on me to admit guilt. - its one of those cases of ""you`re guilty until proven innocent""  On top of all this, if i knew i was guilty of these kind of offences, I probably wouldn`t have reached out so many times to different people about a potential error in my grade.

Straight 'A's, great artist, decent at sports, head of school council, dancer, etc. I looked forward to college, because I'm from a small town and I'd never really experienced life outside that general comfort zone. 
The first semester was fun. I made a lot of friends, partied a lot, went for other college fests etc. But when I received my final grade sheet, I was devastated. I was in the average to below average category. I'd never been that my whole life. After that, I tried hard to pull my GPA up, but it hasn't worked at all. No matter how hard I try, something or the other messes up my grades (examples include the death of my grandfather during finals; my classmate stealing my report and getting a better grade, hanging me out to dry; getting evicted a fortnight before finals with no place to go to; me falling sick on important dates etc.) 
I fell into depression and committed some serious mistakes along the way, that will have a permanent and on-the-record damage in my life.

In the courses that I enjoy taking I end up with an A or B, but with all the other courses I end up with a B or C. 

When studying math, most programs require a 3.0 minimum to do anything with the degree. A 3.5 is better and a 3.75 and up is competitive. 

I lack the work ethic to get those types of grades. I've tried having a good work ethic, but after spring break I always hit a slump, stop turning in work, and get so far behind it is hard to catch up. The thing is though, I like school and learning, I love sitting in lectures and taking notes. I love doing math. But when it comes to doing hw I consciously decide not to do it. 

I want to continue with my education because I don't want to end up work some part time jobs until a manager's position opens up. I tried taking a gap year, but ended it a semester early because I was so miserable not being in an academic setting.

I was trying to become a college professor, but to do that I need to get into a masters program, and to do that I need a good GPA. So I looked into teaching high school, and the GPA requirements are a lot less strenuous than the other professions I was looking into. Becoming a high school teacher feels like settling, but it also feels like the only option I can handle.

Is there anybody in a similar position as me? Is there anybody late in their degree program that are still getting a low GPA? What are you guys' experiences?

496,BxLee,1555900105,/r/college/comments/bfwu01/for_those_of_you_who_suffer_from_test_anxiety_how/,"Hi everyone. It's been a really long semester, and I have around 2.5 weeks left until the end. I've gone through a really rough time. A relationship I was in was put to an end (which, while it destroyed me, it was extremely toxic and was literally making me sick). I've also spent an unhealthy amount of time studying; 8-10 hours of nothing but school work a day. The only extra free time I had went to my then-girlfriend. I stopped doing what I loved most, like playing video games and going out with friends. I even cut my hours down at work to just the weekends so that I could concentrate on school. And honestly, coming as a huge shock to me, I'm still failing. After putting in **so** many hours, spending so much time in my teacher's office, doing all I can to stay afloat... I'm still failing. I've become incredibly depressed the last few weeks.

I've figured out exactly what the problem is, and I've known about it for a few years, since my senior year of high school. I'm suffering from *extreme* test anxiety. I know the material. I make perfect grades on all the homework and projects. But when it comes to the tests, I fail severely. 

I usually study a week, sometimes two weeks before I know I have to take the test. I study incredibly hard, and I feel pretty decent by the day before the test. And then I get the test and... I panic. I start to sweat, and then I think about anything and everything else that isn't the test. For example: I recently had a test a little over a week ago. I spent literally a whole entire week studying, spending 8-10 hours a day looking over work and past projects, and spending two days in my teacher's office asking questions. I felt okay by the day of the test. The test came, I got the test, and it was like I had never been to the class in my life. We had around 75 minutes to take the test; it took me 25 minutes just to calm myself down and start on the first question.

I ended up making around a 60 on the test. I have a 62 average on both my exam grades. I emailed my teacher, and I need an 80 or higher on the final to pass the class with a C (the class is part of my major so I need a C average to move onto the next class).

I guess my question is, for those of you who suffer from extreme anxiety, whether that be from every day life, or specifically from tests. How do you deal with it? I **really** want to pass this semester. I'm so close to finishing my degree, and I just want to be done with it. I have around two weeks to put everything I have into this. And I know I can, but I can't perform on the tests due to my extremely high anxiety. I've tried talking to people; my parents, my teacher, friends. They all think that I'm using test anxiety as an excuse for doing poorly. But honestly, I've suffered from it for around 5 years now, and it's getting to the point where it's starting to ruin my life.

499,milkieroses,1555557756,/r/college/comments/begubs/math_is_ruining_college_for_me_i_want_to_give_up/,"Hi, first time posting on reddit so sorry if I've done something wrong! Also this is incredibly long, sorry.  
 

A little backstory:  
 I've always been bad with anything involving numbers. Since I was in elementary school I've always struggled and couldn't understand why everyone else was so much better than me when it came to math. Even simple things such as reading a clock I could never learn. My dad would teach me several times how to read one and I could never retain how to. Today I still can't read a clock. I've struggled with currency as well--today I get quarters, dimes, and nickels mixed up all the time and there's been several times when I was paying for something at a cash register and I gave the wrong cents. I was always in the lowest math group in primary school and had to get extra help. My dad would spend hours trying to teach me and I could not understand a lot of what I was learning, and it would get to the point where my parents would write the teacher notes to exempt me out of my math homework. I can't do math in my head at all, I still count with my fingers.   
 

Throughout middle and high school I had to come in extra hours all the time to get help with math. I'd always beat myself up because I thought I was really stupid since it never seemed like anyone struggled with numbers as much as me. The worse though was the SAT. I knew I was going to struggle in the math section so I convinced my parents to let me take a $200 prep class for it. I really wanted to do well and worked hard in studying from the class, and when the actual SAT came... I did tremendous. I don't want to say my exact score but it was very low in the math section. I was so upset because I felt like I wasted my parent's money and I was just stupid to spend extra time preparing for that section of the test and didn't even do a little good.   
 

So now to college. I thought it'd be best to take my general math class in my first semester to get it over with so I'd never have to worry about it again. I took Liberal Arts Mathematics which did not go well. I'd spend hours doing one problem on the homework in the library, and then spend the rest of the night working on the same problem. I'd start the homework the day it was assigned because I knew this would happen. It began to get too much for me, there were nights where it was 3 am and I was crying trying to do this homework and I couldn't understand it. I tried watching videos to help which did not help. I was scared to ask for help because I was told this was one of the easiest math classes. What made things worse was the class was at 8 am and I would have to get up at 5 am to get to class in time so staying up so late for homework all the time made me lose sleep. I'm quite the anxious person and sadly my mind was telling me that if I got help people would secretly be making fun of me because I can't understand simple concepts...  
 

So our first test went by and no surprise I bombed it. I finally talked to my professor about how I was struggling and was advised to drop the class for now, so I did. My first semester without a math class was so nice. I could actually get more sleep and work on stuff from my other classes better and I generally felt much happier not having to worry about math.   
 

As reg for next semester was approaching, I knew I needed to try to take a math class again. I decided to take Intro to Stats because a lot of people said that was an easy math class as well. I tried googling about struggling with math in college and came across some forums that talked about dyscalculia. I had never heard of dyscalculia before. I looked it up and was so surprised. Literally every symptom of it--from not being able to read a clock to counting with your fingers--applied to me. My math level is about that of a 3rd grader's as I learned. I never knew there was a learning disability for math and I really wish I had known earlier because I would not have beaten myself up as much as I've always had.   
 

A mistake from me was that I did not try to talk to my counselor after discovering this. Once again I got too anxious too. I reasoned with myself that I could see if I could get through stats. If what happened like last time did, I'd just drop the class and then talk to my counselor.   
 

So stats started and first I was actually doing much better. I didn't spend as long doing the homework as I did with liberal arts math. When the first test came up... I actually felt good! Never before did I feel good for a math test of all things. But then when the test came by I failed it with a 40%. I studied, made a note sheet since it was allowed for the test and still failed. The professor stated that in general alot of students didn't do too well on the test so I thought I could do better on the next one. I turned in all my work and studied a lot for the test. I started going to tutoring as well. I tried encouraging myself that I would do much better this time and I guess I did... I got a 58% which is another failed test. What made me feel worse was that the class average on the test was much higher than my score. That put me down so much.   
 

From there it got worse. I started struggling again on the homework like I had with my Liberal Arts Mathematics homework. I worked on my math so much that it began to affect my other classes as I started to do my homework from my other classes last minute so I could work on math more. I started to get real stressed and had no idea what to do. Tutoring wasn't helping me and when I talked to my professor it wasn't helping me. Everything I learned from them I could not retain.   
 

I was talking to one of my friend's about my situation and I learned from them that their boyfriend actually has dyscalculia as well, and they were able to get exempt from the general math credit from a psychiatrist. We go to the same school so obviously I'd have to do this then! I had a long talk with my mom, and we came to an agreement and I'm planning on seeing a psychiatrist this summer or fall. In the meantime I would just drop the math class.  
 

I made another bad mistake. I didn't realize there was a drop deadline or even what a withdrawal was. I couldn't drop the class for some reason and was confused but let it go. A few days went by and I stopped going to my math class because I thought I wouldn't be in it anymore soon. The days where I didn't go to stats felt good. I actually felt happy again in school and enjoyed being able to relax and do my other work without struggling with my math homework.   
 

I just learned earlier what a withdrawal is and I missed the deadline. I feel so stupid. I can't even drop the class now. I told my mom and she flipped out. I'm pretty sure I was failing math already because I had failed two tests and there is two left including the final. The next test is in a couple of days and with me missing a few classes already and not doing good in math in general I know for sure that I won't pass this test no matter how much I will study. My mom does not want me failing a class whatsoever. There's no way I'm going to pass this class. I want to bawl. I can't believe I did not understand withdrawing and I wish I dropped the class earlier. My mom wants me to go to my next stats class but I was so happy when I did not have to worry about math anymore. Now I am freaking out thinking about staying up all night trying to study and do one math problem on the homework that I won't even get right. I want to wait to go to a psychiatrist so I can get exempt from math. This is stressing me out so badly now that it's making me want to give up with college. Math is ruining college for me and I feel like I'll never graduate now. I finally set up a counselor appointment to talk about this but it isn't until next week. I'd rather just miss this class and test so I can relax and not stress out. My counselor appointment is after this test and I can't make it any earlier so I have no clue what to do. I don't want to make my mom upset by not going, but I'd feel so much better if I didn't go to stats. But it'll probably look bad if I have a failed class on my transcript right?

No way I can do calculus or linear algebra and become a coder- it just doesnt interest me either (I've tried to learn programming languages, and nearly pulled my own hair out). The only solid hobby I've ever had is music, but I have lost much of my interest in it and never enjoyed creating it. Only listening to it and performing it were ever fun to me.

 I dont play video games, I dont watch tv, I work part time, and I exercise. I take new opportunities as they appear to me but honestly life just feels completely dull unless I'm out with friend drinking some beers and talking about life. That's the only activity that I get to rise out of bed in the morning for and look forward to occasionally. I realize I've always felt this way. In elementary through highschool I've always been disinterested in the subjects but can pass tests thanks to a good memory. Sadly I was never taught any trades by family members so I'm not exactly good with my hands and I nearly failed shop class in highschool. I dont know where I belong and whether or not I should stick with college and try to find an easy low paying job in the humanities, or drop out and gain experience so I can go to trade school and work a blue collar job. 

Another thing to know is that even though I'm not trying hard here, I've always been praised for my writing ability. I dislike writing very much but I've never got less than an A on an essay or research paper -usually A+s. I'd consider expressing myself with the written word an actual talent of mine, but it is draining due to perfectionism and I dont feel happy or fulfilled while doing it.

My story (if you're interested) started pretty early in school. I knew from a young age that I was going to have to work hard to not live paycheck to paycheck like my parents do. But I was no where near the highest ranking in my class. I managed to graduate from high-school barely in the top 10% of my class and tried to look into applying for community college. Unfortunately, my family was so broke that all the money I saved up for college working at a local grocery store pretty much went to put food on the table or pay bills, all $6,000 of it. I eventually had to quit my job because our second car broke down and my dad needed the our now only vehicle to get to work (I also couldn't afford a licence at this time). My dreams of going to college were crushed and I remember giving up on the idea as I saw all my friends go straight from high-school to 4 year universities. I began to sink into a depression and became so unmotivated to do anything. I remember crying in my room one day completely given up on life and I just got so upset that my life was going no where before it even began, so I said fuck it and started applying to universities knowing that I had no idea how I was going to pay for it.

I remember having no idea what I was doing and my parents (who had no college experience) couldn't help me. It took me getting over being a shy introvert to make tons of phone calls, hours of research online, setting up appointments, gathering documents from my parents to set up a FAFSA, which was a nightmare let me tell you. My parents are not good at keeping up with where important documents are. Anyway, about a month to two months later of getting everything in by the deadlines, I got my acceptance letter to my local 4 year university. But it wasn't until I opened my financial aid letter that I broke down, because it told me that through grants and loans I could afford to go. I felt life and a struggle inside me that day for the first time in a long time.

Hopefully that wasn't too long! I left out a lot of things, like my dads unemployment for years and my mothers cancer while I was in high-school. My abusive ex-boyfriend that I lived with for a year during my freshman year of college. FINALLY getting a licence at 22 in Texas where NOTHING is walking distance. And my brother dropping out of high-school without even completing his freshman year due to anxiety issues. That one still kills me.

TLDR: Worked hard &gt; failure &gt; depression &gt; spark of motivation &gt; more hard work &gt; holy shit am I really in college now?

I had a 2.5 gpa first semester and I was hoping to fix it but now I have no hope whatsoever of doing this. First and foremost I dont even have a major nor do I know what it is I want to do. Nothing interests me besides my artistic hobbies which I am not even consistent in. 

I'm taking a bunch of random classes and before spring break I took midterms for 3 of them, for 2 of them I was allowed to have a sheet of notes!!! And I bombed one with the cheatsheet (the professor was so harsh because he wanted a gross amount of detail and I had the main ideas but he gave me zeros as if i didnt even try), and the 2nd one (without the cheat sheet) I also bombed because I dont understand the class at all. I tried to study but I sort if struggle with ADD so its hard for me to comprehend the textbook, and my school isnt willing to help me with my condition.

To cut it short I recieved all of midterm grades today and I was so confident I atleast passed the 2 exams with the sheet. I recieved two 50's and my highest exam was barely over 80. The events of today literally has ruined my day and overall confidence and I think I might have become depressed in the matter of 5 hours.

He's expressed his willingness to improve. He's smart and I know he can push through this last month or two; I just don't know how to guide him. 

-

So me and my boyfriend are freshmen in college, we are both taking general ed courses right now. I'm trying to save him in college, at least for the last bit of the semester. I'm an honors student, and he's on academic probation. Right now he is failing most of his classes (his best grade is an arts attendance grade) and his last semester GPA put him in academic probation. He is not doing good.

He really doesn't check his student website or plan anything, doesn't talk to his professors, and only sometimes goes to class (and then doesn't take notes). He is usually playing video games, sleeping, or with me (I'll do my homework with him, he says he ""doesn't have any""). He doesn't utilize his resources very well and thinks ""because I'm far behind I shouldn't go because I won't know anything"" (the logic behind this.... I know. I've tried to explain). 

I don't want him to be a lost cause, or think of himself that way either. He is SUCH a smart individual and if he just did his part he would be passing with flying colors. His parents are kind of giving up on him, and so are his professors. But I don't want him to fail out of college. This semester is his last chance before his parents cut him off and he has to fend for himself.

He really hasn't had experience with doing things for himself, and high school was- well, high school, so he didn't have to try very hard. He also has ADHD and is not taking any medicine, which I know is a likely cause of his issues- we're calling his doctor tomorrow. 

I feel very bad saying this, but I've looked through his whole student page and it's *bad*. I think it's somewhat possible to come out of where he's at, but that's for just me- and I'm an honors student and afraid of the failure. I honestly don't know how he can pull this off, and I'm scared for him. 

I really would *not* like any comments like ""you can't help him"", ""he's just not going to do it"", ""he's already past the point of no return"", ""you can't change him"", etc. If you're going to comment that, just ignore the post.. He has expressed his willingness to get back on track and start to listen to me as sort of an advisor. I know he wants to succeed, but he doesn't know where to start and feels hopeless. I also am keeping up with my work around helping him, so that's not a concern. 

I want to help him, but even I don't know where to start. Any advice, resources, or anecdotes are appreciated. ",college,Trying to motivate my boyfriend to not fail out of school. Help?

510,interimacct,1552878588,/r/college/comments/b2dn16/studied_abroad_against_my_own_will_has_not_worked/,"Hey all,

I'm a junior Sociology/Political Science major in the US who is studying abroad this semester, and not having a good time, nor is my performance, and want advice on what to do.

For context, I didn't want to do this, I'm on the cusp of graduating on time, and already am not the best student (2.5 GPA), I struggle with a lot of depression, insomnia, anxiety etc which makes school difficult in the first place and thought this just was NOT the move, I figured my best bet was to stick with it at my home university, figure it out here and have classes that I know will directly go towards graduating and try and find a good job or internship with my advising help due to my low GPA. Then graduate, get a job, make money, and I'll travel or work somewhere foreign once my life is together.

My parents insisted I go on the merits I have three other siblings that went and had the ~~ time of their lives ~~, and obliged, signed up for a program in London, and got into three of the four classes that go towards graduating.

Fact of the matter is, it's been really shitty, London is cool but not much different from home, people here are a bit stand off-ish, my programs filled with a bunch of greek life types which isn't me, I haven't made a single friend and I'm often alone, actually alone all the time. I can deal with loneliness but at this capacity it's thrown me into a deep depression that I've suffered before. I go days without sleeping and some days will sleep 16 hours a day. I don't really do anything. My classes are all pretty basic and are things I've learned my freshman year which make it really hard to focus. My parents conceded it wasn't the best idea to just throw me out here and offered me to come home after a month but I tried to stay in order to make the most of it.

A month later it hasn't gotten better, and the grade weighting for two of my classes both papers which are 7 pages long and are 60% and 50% of my grade, and I haven't turned them in yet. And I fear that even if I turned them in a week and a half late that'll already set me up for failing two classes out here, and it makes me wonder if it's even worth being here anymore or if I should just pack it up, fly home, and work somewhere until summer rolls around and take summer classes/work or intern somewhere.

It's shitty because to the university I'm studying at I probably look like some idiot American who get's hammered every weekend in a new place and just decided to say fuck school. But honest to god I haven't left the UK yet. Matter of fact I've turned down offers to travel with friends from the US in order to get my schoolwork done, I just can't get myself to do it, I'm in a miserable state right now and loathing in pity that I was granted a lotta privilege and fucked it all the way up.

511,BigBlueMongoose,1552859682,/r/college/comments/b2ajf7/im_a_firstyear_having_trouble_making_solid/,"Hello!

I've always had a pretty close group of friends growing up. However, while I've been here, I feel like I've made a lot of acquaintances but very few close friendships (if any at all). For example, I eat with some people from my classes every so often and I work on homework/study with them pretty often. In any of these cases, I feel like I enjoy their company but I don't just ""hang out"" with them regularly like they do with each other. For context, I also have a girlfriend who I've been with for a while here and she's awesome.

I've always had the privilege of having a close circle of friends in high school and in other activities I've done but here, for the first time, I feel very alone and friendless. I have been dealing with pretty bad (clinical)depression since my last year of high school and my hypothesis now is that I've become somewhat of a fragment of a person that's just too boring to connect with others. I try to be considerate and to remember things about people and to ask about them but it always seems like they would rather be with their real friends than me.

I'm pretty sick of it, to be honest. Going through every day is agonizing and I think having friends like I did would make it better. I've noticed that I feel better about myself and everything else when I have a social interaction that I judge to be positive for both the person/people I'm talking to and I. I want to change and I want to be better but I feel broken.

I'd imagine that my experience is quite common for freshmen so in r/learnmath's fashion, I will explain what I've done and ask for advice from those who are more knowledgeable on the kind of things that might be to come.

I've sought out medical treatment(medication, therapy) for my condition and I've tried to just be myself around people more. I've also started exercising every day. I plan on joining some relevant clubs(possibly an org/frat) to me next quarter so I can put myself out there more and also so I can do more things(generally, I don't do a lot right now. My day is mostly spend on Youtube and studying).

A large piece of advice I see on making close friends is that I should organize my own hang outs and invite people even if I don't feel that close to them. However, I've always struggled with that and especially now, I would have a really hard time doing that. However, if it really seems like that's the one thing I need to do to improve everything, then I absolutely will do it.

For those of you who've gone through something even remotely similar, did it help? Is it worth the effort? I get scared that I already have what I want and I just don't realize it but I feel like something's different... but I suppose that might just be how college is.

512,Atsut,1552441096,/r/college/comments/b0g58x/intro_engineering_class_ranthelp/,"I am in a class at my college that is required by freshman to take. It is split into 2 semesters. This is the first year the college is offering the class and they didn't test it out. As such the first semester went horribly. 25% of the class dropped out or failed, compared to 5% from the previous class. Grades had to be curved by at least 10% and 70% of a final project was showing up to present it. Please keep in mind that this is an intro class. 

The first semester, the teachers tried to teach us some basic programming and basic engineering. They failed miserably, I came in knowing multiple programming languages and I had trouble following their lessons. The rest of the class was much worse off. For quizzes and tests and the like, they'd ask questions that they never taught us how to do. One of these was having us write a program with a nested if statement. We had only learned how to do an if statement in class that day and if they hadn't taken a programming class beforehand it is unlikely that the class would have realized that the problem required a nested if statement nor would they know how to write one.

The homework and outside work for this class was also extremely high, with an average of, I believe, students spending somewhere between 15 and 18 hours a week (this was a 3 credit hour class). Needless to say, this class was awful and when course evaluations came around me and everyone else called it out for the pos it was.

Unfortunately, the faculty in charge of this class didn't learn anything from the complaints of the students and decided to make this semester harder. This class only has the prerequisite of the previous class. They jumped straight into the middle of a random topic. I had never taken a class on it, most of the class hadn't either and there was no prerequisite for it. It went about as well as you'd expect. Failing to realize we had no idea what we were doing, they just jumped straight to another topic. A topic I didn't even know the name of until a friend saw my homework and told me. 

We just took an exam and the average was a 50, I have no clue what I am doing and the same can be said for the other about 1000 students in the class. I can't do this anymore and the teachers keep piling on homework and new topics with no regard for the fact that the majority of the class just failed their exam. They literally just gave a 20 point curve so that it looked like the class was doing fine.

I've tried talking to the person in charge of the class but he was very quick to place to blame on me for not watching their awful preclass videos, which I have watched. When I asked him about this being a weed out class, he said it wasn't and he was just trying to show us how hard college is. He just reminded me of a republicans trying to excuse trump for whatever dumb thing he's just done. His excuses made no sense and meeting with him was a waste of time.

I honestly can not deal with this class anymore and I don't see there being anything I can do considering the high ups in the school won't do anything to fix this class.

513,ComradeSeaman,1552276962,/r/college/comments/azopb5/should_i_transfer_to_another_college_closer_to/,"TLDR: I go to a commuter school far from home and I feel lonely. Should I give up the good program I'm in to go back home for school?

Sorry for the wall of text.

I am a Freshman in an accelerated Pharmacy Program on the East Coast. I've been wrestling with this idea for a lot of time recently and would like some advice for what I should do.

For starters, I am originally from California. Most of my extended family lives around the same area as me, so I tend to associate the two. When I was applying for colleges, I felt that I wanted something beyond California. I didn't want to feel like I never tried to explore beyond my home. Also, I considered my talents and influences, and figured that I wanted to become a Pharmacist.

So, once the acceptances and rejections came in, I decided that I would go to this university in New York with an accelerated Pharmacy program. Not only did it provide a direct path to a career, but it was also a big change from my normal settings. Further, I received more scholarships for that school than any others I applied to, making it essentially the same price I would pay to attend a UC. So, with a set career, big change that I wanted, and (relatively) a lot of money, what more could I ask for?

Well, now that I am in my second semester of Freshman, as well as the power of hindsight, I recognize some of the issues with my situation.

For one, the school I go to is a commuter school. I failed to take this into account when I applied, but now I realize the issues this causes. Namely, it is much more difficult to create a social circle. I don't think that it's because it's a commuter school, but because it is a commuter school in another state. Beyond school hours, campus is practically dead, with little to no events besides the introductory freshman events and the like. It feels like everyone who goes here went to the same high schools or were even in the same friend groups before they went to college, and trying to join in on these groups feels awkward at best, and downright rude at worst. Further, any sense of party atmosphere is dominated by the frats which, frankly, I'm not into. There is the sense of exclusivity where you need to know the right people to go to these events. Also, because of the commuter environment, a lot of people who do live on campus tend to go home on the weekends, increasing the lonely atmosphere that campus has.

I tried to remedy this by joining clubs, but I failed to get to know anyone beyond other freshmen who joined the club at the same time. I've made a couple of friends along the way, mostly through virtue of being in the same program or club, but nothing feels substantially close for me.

But, most of all, I feel homesick. I love New York and being able to explore it on a vastly superior public transportation system is a nice bonus. But, the more I try to explore, the more alone I feel. It feels awkward trying to get to explore a place with someone who has lived there their whole life and is not even particularly close to you. I start to think more about home and all the friends and family I left to ""Do my own thing.""

From here, I feel that I have two choices:

1. Stick it out and hope the situation gets better
2. Transfer out to another college

I have reason to believe in Option 1 because it is the same thing that happened to me in High School. I didn't truly have a reliable friend group until late into my Junior Year. I still talk with them and make the effort to hang out whenever I come back home. But, I still remember the first two and a half years of loneliness and fake-feeling friendships I had to deal with until I made it to that point. Also, who's to say it'll work out like that again?

Option 2 is a much riskier path, but the rewards I might reap are also much higher. If I do transfer out, I feel that my best option might be one of the UCs. From what I observed during my college visits, the UCs tended to have more active campuses overall. Further, with a greater number of people coming from within the state, I have much more in common with the other students.

The greatest loss out of this option is transferring out of the accelerated Pharmacy Program. One of the benefits of being within the program is that I do not have to take the PCAT. If I were to transfer out, I would first have to apply to another major, graduate, and then take the PCAT and apply into another Pharmacy School. All this taking \~8 years, whereas the current program is 6.

Another option is to attend UoP in Stockton, which also has multiple Pre-Pharmacy Programs. However, I am unsure of the exact details of how my credits would transfer (UoP has 2+3, 3+3, and 4+3 programs, whereas my current college is 0-6) or if I would even be allowed to apply to those programs. Further, UoP is also quite expensive, and I chose not to attend as I originally felt that I did not receive enough scholarships to justify attendance.

Perhaps I could do a little of both - stick it out for my sophomore year and, if it still doesn't work out, transfer.

However, I can't help but hear this nagging notion that I'm simply conflating California and Comfort. As a transfer, I feel that I would have just as hard a time with creating my social circle as I do now, simply because most friendships would have already been established.

514,PuffkinPie,1552214054,/r/college/comments/azehaq/got_into_a_bad_situation_with_one_of_my/,"Hi everyone. Last week, I got into a bad situation with one of my professors in my major. For some background—I have known this professor since I’ve started college, and I while  don’t consider myself “best buds” with them, I still consider to have a good professional student-teacher relationship.

The whole situation started when I got into a misunderstanding of sorts in our club, which my professor is the advisor to. Our club is a professional organization, and this is my first semester being president. I won’t go into too much information, but basically, I had asked someone on the club to do this project of sorts for a volunteer event coming up, and come time of the due date, they had done something different than what I had asked, and my professor was mad at me for putting all of this project on them. Which is fine, I will take the blame for being too vague. However, the same volunteer event and project had been done before with the same protocol under a different president, so I was just following similar protocol. I didn’t have evil intentions by putting this project all on this person, and I didn’t think my professor would have a problem with it since the same was done last semester. 

I explained this to my professor via email that I was just following a similar protocol to last semesters president. I also said that this seemed to be a misunderstanding, and I would like to meet with them first thing the next day to discuss these issues and what exactly my role is in the club. 

At the meeting, however, this professor went an entirely different route. It was a more of a bashing session on me than a discussion. I am not sure how they misconstrued this, but this professor thought I was withholding information from them in some way about the event. The professor went on to tell me that I was “arrogant”, and “not fit to be in the profession because of my behavior”. They didn’t even bring up the situation with the other member, which is what I thought we were going to be discussing. I was very upset by what they said, and I was trying to explain that I think they were misunderstanding me. They told me that I was just making excuses.

My professor is known to be intimidating, but I felt that this was almost an attack on my character. I was especially hurt by their words of not being fit for my major as I am now, because I make very good grades and take my major very seriously. 

After the discussion, my professor said it was water under the bridge, but I can’t help but feel weird and upset about the whole situation. My major is small and everyone knows each other, so this is sure to go around. I feel very unmotivated about my club and my major currently. I have tried very hard in my major and for my professor to say all that, it just feels like a big stab in the back. 

I’m just not sure what to do about this situation. I don’t want to be on bad terms with this professor either, as they kind of control whether or not I can get into grad school. However, I just generally feel very unmotivated to do well now. 

TLDR; I got into a bad situation with one of my professors, they attacked my character, need advice as to what I should do about the whole thing.

So, I'm a 25 year old female in my masters degree program for city planning and its my second semester/quarter. I have depression, anxiety, and fibromyalgia so I have an accommodation letter from accessibility centre (unfortunately just got my mental health not physical) and all my professors have a copy. I essentially don't have motivation or energy to even brush my teeth let alone write 30 page paper or commute 2 hours to campus. hence the letter. I can eventually write those papers but with more time given to me rather than the like 2 or 3 weeks. Last time i tried to go to class i was in tears on the bus because I felt so lifeless and zapped of energy.  I also go to therapy so im not just sitting here, i'm trying to get better so i don't have to be like this anymore.   


One prof already said that despite my letter ive missed too many classes (3 out of 6) so i should just drop her course........ as someone with mental health issues that put me so. down.   


I'm now dropped to part time student status thanks to her because I need 3 classes minimum to be considered full time, and she was my third class.  


Today I have class for one of my remaining classes but I'm not going because i can't move. mentally im dissociated. physically im in pain. I missed last class too, and a couple before that. This professor told me I can hand in my assignments late, and he was actually my advisor last year so he knows I hand in things incredibly late and never show up but still get things done. But for some reason Im worried because im sitting here thinking all the worst things  


he's in class now thinking ""of course she's not here again"", or thinking im a shit student or a failure, thinking i'm no going to graduate, or im a waste of class space. Or because I haven handed anything yet that he thinks i never will and im a shit student. I already get these vibes from my classmates and it makes me feel even more depressed being seen as a failure. So thinking my professor is also thinking these things is really making my depression even worse.   


So basically thanks to anxiety i care very much what people think of me esp when they think im a failure, and depression makes me dwell on it and beat myself up and call myself the worst names. In addition to this I think he's gonna give up on me and fail me. Its starting to drive me insane. I can't stop thinking about anything else and its draining and I just want to sleep.   


I want to tell myself logically he a) doesn't give af or b) knows ill get my stuff done and isn't judging me. but its so hard for me to believe that and these thoughts are consuming me.   


I don't know what to do. these thoughts just make it even harder to start assignments or go to class. i feel so hopeless. 

**TLDR;** I have depression, anxiety, and fibromyalgia so I miss a lot of school and hand in assignments late because most of the time i'm shut of physically, mentally or both.  I have an accommodation letter for these reasons that my profs have copies of, but i cant help but think they think i'm a failure because i'm never in class, and are going to flunk me before I even have a chance to hand things in. These thoughts are consuming me and making my depression and anxiety worse, which is in turn making it even more difficult for me to go to school or do assignments.

516,Kof22zlyf,1551768016,/r/college/comments/axi1o0/my_gpa_is_getting_wrecked/,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently a junior majoring in Biochemistry/Chemistry at University of California- San Diego who transferred in this academic school year from a junior college (JC) and I need help. I did okay when I was at JC though I had some grade slips here and there (2 C's in Calc, but mostly A's and a couple B's) but after transferring, my GPA just keeps getting destroyed.

&amp;#x200B;

Last quarter, I took the third sequence of calculus (Vector geometry, vector functions and their derivatives. Partial differentiation. Maxima and minima. Double integration), General Physics A with calc based calc (mechanics), and Biochem A. I know this is a 4 year university with lots of people who are really smart and therefore the school is more academically rigorous but I ended up getting an A- in biochem and C's in both Calc and Physics.

When I was at JC, I was homeless and lived in a car while working 20+ hours a week and taking 3 stem classes with 2 labs for entire period but I did fine. At UCSD, I'm not working and only have to focus on my studies yet this quarter too seems to be going downhill. I'm weak at math but I ended up getting a D and a C- for my two midterms in Differential equations when the class average was a 76% and 82% respectively. Physics is better this quarter than last but am still borderline C/B  at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not like I'm not studying. I know UCSD is harder than a JC so I'm putting in the extra hours and effort but it's just so discouraging and disheartening when my grades aren't reflecting even a bit of the hard work I put in. I also know that while they are important, grades aren't important and I've embraced this so even if I don't get an A, I know that it's not the end of the world and frankly I don't mind getting a B. But starting with C's is where I'm getting worried about my future of getting a job, internships and getting into grad school. Getting an internship here at UCSD or places around it is so cutthroat brutal that your GPA is the first factor that the companies and PI's look at.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried switching up my study methods, places I study at, literally stalked my TA's and professors during their office hours, went to the tutorial centers on campus, watched supplementary videos online, read the textbook, and heck, I thought maybe I have ADHD or something so I even met with the college psychiatrist but nothing...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm getting desperate here. My course loads will only get worse as my progress into my education. 

How screwed am I and do you have any advice for me my good people of Reddit?

517,tesrella,1551712282,/r/college/comments/ax855j/thinking_about_completely_withdrawing_from_this/,"Bear with me, this is long.

I'm a sophomore in computer engineering. I switched to this major from computer science for last semester, and now during this semester I'm having second thoughts about the decision to switch. I want to fully unenroll from this semester so that I can get my private pilots license.

Rewind back to the beginning of my college career; out of high school I decided I wanted to be a commerical airline Pilot, and that's still the overarching goal of everything I'm doing in life, to this day. There are many ways to become a commercial pilot, one of them being go through the military and use military benefits to pay for flight training and required flight hours. I tried the military, and that definitely wasn't for me, and I had to leave basic training.

Fast forward to after I got back home from basic training; my father passed away from cancer, and that threw me an emotional curveball. I received life insurance benefits, a large amount of them, and decided I would use that money to become a pilot. Just a couple months after my father passed, I went to my first flying lesson, and got so sick I decided I never wanted to become a pilot because it was too draining. I was emotionally distressed at the time and was not able to make rationalizing decisions because of the emotional hurt I was feeling from losing my father. After a year or two of getting my shit together, I now want to try becoming a pilot again.

I decided that the only other thing I could think of doing would be to go to college and get a degree. I wasn't thinking about it at the time, but this is another thing commerical airlines  want pilots to have; a degree. I enrolled for my freshman year in computer science, an area of study for which I have passion and am really talented, and completed my first two semesters with a 3.8 GPA. I liked the core classes enough that I didn't have any problems breezing through the material and I had a basic understanding of the concepts covered in those classes.

Then summer break came, and I got bored. For some reason I decided that computer science wasn't difficult enough or challenging, or something, and decided that I was going to switch to my university's new Computer Engineering program. Now, the bad thing about this was, I don't actually appreciate any of the courses I'm taking now. Almost all of the physics, science and math classes I'm taking are hard as hell and I just don't appreciate the courses as much as I did with computer science. The two degrees are VERY different. This degree program is also not accredited, so it basically has no value until the University can prove that the degree is worth something. Overall, for one step to becoming a pilot, all you need is a degree in something, anything.

I'm in the second semester of my sophomore year, and only the second semester of being a Computer engineering major. After a long road trip, spending time to think about where my life is taking me, and remembering how much I really have a passion for flying and aeronautics, I'm seriously considering dropping just this semester to continue pursuing the dream of becoming a pilot. I can use the 10 weeks I have remaining this spring until an internship I landed to really buckle down and get my private pilots license.

After this summer, I'll re-apply to the computer science major and finish my degree.

I also want to mention that I have scholarships and other aid that will not be affected this semester if I withdraw from all of my classes, and I'll continue to be covered for the next two years of my college degree even if I withdraw.

Should I do this?

TL;DR, I want to switch back to my old major because this one is too hard, and I don't even want to use my degree, whatever it is, beyond showing it when applying to become a commercial Pilot because airlines require a degree. There will be no financial penalty if I switch back and withdraw. Should I do it?",college,Thinking about completely withdrawing from this semester.

518,FreezingDemon,1551458648,/r/college/comments/aw6z2p/help_me_decide_between_three_majors_please/,"Hello everyone! I'm currently a freshman student in my spring semester. After essentially wasting this school year trying unsuccessfully to make engineering work out for me, I've decided to not continue with engineering anymore. March 12th is when I can schedule summer classes (which I will need to take to catch up regardless of major) so I've constantly been in a mind-battle trying to decide on my path for the fall! 

**Computer Science**

Pros: 

* Easiest major to schedule (so this isn't a significant pro, but still a pro regardless)
* Marketable, in demand, lots of opportunities after graduation
* Opportunities for where I am interested in working (My end goal would be to work in space/aerospace)
* A 'sciencey' field 

Cons:

* Similar environment/people as engineering? (One of the many reasons that engineering didn't feel right to me was the overall feeling I got when I was in class. I'm a social butterfly, and most people...were not. While people don't have a real bearing on my education, the environment just felt off for me personally.)
* I don't feel the 'spark' (I've tried to learn Python using things like CodeCademy and MIT OCW and all that. It just feels...okay. )
* Don't know if I would actually do well/ enjoy it (Goes back to previous con. I've never taken a programming course before, and I know that you don't have to, but I just don't know if it would be right for me.)

**English + Medical School**

This one is probably crazy-sounding and impossible since I totally just thought about this a couple days ago but hear me out for a sec. Some of my greatest strengths are in writing, reading, and speaking. I know that I would have a strong chance of enjoying and succeeding as an English major. But then I thought about medical school. It would allow me to still pursue my interest of using science to better humanity and help others, on top of creating a balance between humanities and science in undergrad.

Pros:

* Have a strong chance of doing well/enjoying English major
* Science classes + humanities would be fulfilling to me because I'm a jack of all trades and like to be well-rounded
* Possibly better environment for me?
* Would have a goal I would be fighting for all throughout college 

Cons:

* Medical school is EXTREEEEEMELY hard to get into. Expensive, too!
* I don't know if medicine is right for me yet. Could I see myself doing it? Potentially. But I don't have a ton of experience in exploring the field like other pre-med students seem to have. The only thing I can think of is the time in high school when they had a day event for interested students and we visited a hospital.
* English isn't a good back-up major if I don't get into med school. I could reapply to med school or do a grad program or something, but still.
* Would most likely have to take another year to complete undergrad. It's not really a major con for me other than potentially the finances. (to be honest, I would secretly enjoy an extra year for extracurriculars since I wasted this year being miserable)

**Geology**

Pros:

* A good major for my interest in space. I would definitely be going to grad school and getting my Ph.D, in planetary science or another space-related field.
* I enjoy learning about Earth's history and how studying it can be useful in understanding the solar system. \[Also, rocks are cool. They always end up getting stuck in my shoe...maybe it's a sign? ;) (Just joking)\]
* My school offers a lot of geo classes. I'd most likely be doing the geophysics track.
* The most 'sciencey' of the three majors.

Cons:

* Again...don't know if I would do well/enjoy it. I've never taken a geo class before. The last time it was part of a class was in 8th grade. I really enjoyed it back then though!
* I would probably have to take Calc 3...ehh. I've taken Calculus 1 already, and if I do Geology/Computer Science, I'll be taking Calc 2 this summer. Math isn't my strong suit but I will work as hard as it takes.
* Not a very marketable degree by itself...or really even after grad school.

She inserted herself into my life slowly like laughing at my jokes butting into conversations responding to stuff to talk to me or laughing. Asking me to repeat stuff to her then wait for me after class to scare me after we talk. I met her because she laughed long and hard at a bad joke I made then asked me to repeat it to her then after I talked to her waited after class for me to pop out say boo.She began finding any way to talk to me. While talking got red made no eye contact and smiled while hiding her face. Blushed around me. We’d joke around and tease each other a game between us. Her friends acted funny. Her friend pushed me to her. Her friend would ask me to be around them and find any excuse for me to, when her friend sat between us and talked to me and flirted with me she didn't seem to happy had an attitude. She wanted to be next to me and didn't want her friend between us in pictures. We started taking selfies and she'd want me to get close to her for all. She sent me the picture so I could post she would like it then tell me in person. She would approach me with her friend and her friend would just push me to her, if I ignored them or walked away they would follow me and just continue trying to talk to me. She got dressed up and her friend came and got me for a selfie with her. She found any way to talk to me and compliment me. Hover around me and try to talk to me, approaching me with her friends help.When I was minding my own business she would giggle say my name. Do it when I looked at her. Blush when I say hi. She liked a picture with my dad tagged in it to then tell me she likes it, so she can show up on both our notifications. While talking held never ending eye contact and smiled not stopping in silence. I'd break eye contact and she continues standing in front of me staring at me. She found out info about me to tell me. When I talked to her tried to scare me or take a selfie with me. Stare at me every chance. She showered me with so much flattery and attention. But the thing is, she never left me alone. She began butting in intensely when I talk to other people, especially girls and she would just start laughing loudly, butt in respond ask questions. I made a joke about moving out of town and she had some issue with me she stopped talking to me. Her friend told me I hurt her feelings. She continued staring at me and stuff but not anywhere near as happy. Then when I was talking to another guy she started screaming at me out of nowhere and calling me names attacking me. Her best friend would look at her and say her name when I enter a room. The thing is she never stopped, when I ignored her she would continue giggle and say my name when I said something bad. Say my name when I talked about something bad. Continue trying to butt into my conversations. She just never left me alone and didnt stop flirting with me. Say my name like bossing me around when I talk about something bad. I would just talk about height and weight to someone else and she said ""Nobody else is as big as you"". Her Friend would go around finding information about me then tell her and she told me everything she heard. She just never stops flirting and just so aggressive and when I ignore or just don't do anything she continues. Its like she would reward me if I talk to her by flirting with me, waiting for me after class to scare me or selfies and all her compliments. Then while talking to me she held long eye contact smiled. When we were done she continued staring into my eyes and smiling in silence, then when I broke it continued staring at me when shes right in front of me. She did that multiple times and her friends would smile and look at me or giggle.

As I got older and saw her around she went to a place with a clear view staring at me. I saw her at her work and she did that. I went to her work once and she saw me said hi, was in one spot then moved to another that was a clear view she could see me in and I could see her and she stayed there the whole time and stared. Then I saw her in a car. I stared at her not knowing it was her because she was laughing loudly. She looked over at me she held eye contact and stared back at me, when I broke eye contact didn't stop and watched me leave. She did this when my mom was right next to me. I broke eye contact and didn't look back. She didn't like that. Months later her and her mom go back on my fb to remove their likes on a pic dedicated to my dads death. Her mom liked my dad and she obviously talked about me to them because she found out that my dad bought a motorcycle from hers. After that she had an attitude, I worked with her, she stared at me while putting on a jacket and didn't stop when caught and the supervisor said something and she was shocked.

Well now we go to the same college she saw me when shes walking into her class on time and I was staying late for that class she was showing up on time and sat down stared at me when I wasn't looking for a few seconds. Now after seeing me shows up 30 minutes early walks by looking in at me then walks by many times like 4+ times stands in the doorway then waits outside. Nobody does this and everyone else in her class is not there. Everyone else waits in their car between classes. Her friend acts like I don't exist when she sees me around and only went up to talk to me once. Her friend got a boyfriend and he lived right next door to me, she never said hi or anything.

I am just frustrated and upset in general because she never stops flirting with me in general and does it aggressively and when I ignore just persists and then eventually lashes out at me and does bad stuff. Then has some issue over stuff then lashes out at me. She never stops and just perists, she lashes out has an attitude over something stupid and starts up again. I get uncomfortable and ignore, she gets upset, angry and lashes me out. She showered me with so much attention, flattery and compliments. Selfies but I just can't get space or a break and when I get uncomfortable and ignore her or show negative body language/ response she just throws a fit and lashes out doing bad stuff. She acted like a supporting friend and shows support for stuff but then gets mad and take it away lashing out over that stuff. She just feels like a flirty big sister and using that dynamic to her advantage pushing me around and in a way bullying me. I just feel discouraged because I feel like she is the only female friend I really ever had. Her and her friend. Her friend would find any excuse to be around me and offered me a ride when it's unnecessary. She might know I am autistic because she is known for having a short fuse blowing up at people and she doesn't treat me that way and been extra patient wouldn't care if I interrupted her, ask questions on topics I am fixated with, instantly believe stuff I say take my side on stories when she was upset with me. Gets upset with me and then gets over it. I am just heartbroken because she feels like the best female friend i ever had and will never have someone like her again. The best female friend I had but she bossed me around and kind've abused me and has been for years. I have been hurting for years. I want to be friends but the way she acts makes me not want anything to do with her but I do care about her and love her platonically.

TL;DR

I met a girl when I was younger she did stuff that's impossible to ignore to get my attention. She continued this stuff for years and flirts to the point it is uncomfortable and doesn't stop then has an issue when I get mad or uncomfortable and ignore her and she lashes out. She does things that are impossible to ignore and continues this into college. Showing up 30 minutes early to her class when I am in the class before, and walking by a lot and standing in the door, waiting outside. I have not felt comfortable by how she acts and have been ignoring her. I do care about her and have platonic feelings for her.

I am an undergraduate of biological sciences in my third semester. I have tried very hard to stick with my major of choice in hopes of going on to medical school once my undergraduate was finished. Thinking realistically, or perhaps pessimistically, that is just not going to happen. I have a 2.9 GPA and although I have tried **ridiculously** hard to succeed it isn't improving. 

Just for background: I've taken two general biology courses, two general chemistry courses, labs for both of those, statistics, anchor/discourse (speech &amp; comp) in my previous semesters then cell biology, organic chemistry 1 + lab, political science and anchor/discourse this semester. I started a semester late and work part time in claims for a freight company, so I have dabbled in business a bit. 

That said I have three main questions - When is too late to change majors? How do you know what to change it to? What are the costs of changing your major?

I'm crushed guys. I thought I had it all figured out. I don't know how to tell my parents, my boyfriend, anyone. I don't even know if this is the right decision. I guess I would like to hear arguments from both sides of the story - from those who switched to majors that they really love now and those who stuck it out even if it was a struggle.

Its like she would reward me if I talk to her by flirting with me, waiting for me after class to scare me or selfies and all her compliments.

As I got older and saw her around she went to a place with a clear view staring at me. I saw her at her work and she did that. I went to her work once and she saw me said hi, was in one spot then moved to another that was a clear view she could see me in and I could see her and she stayed there the whole time and stared. Then I saw her in a car. I stared at her not knowing it was her because she was laughing loudly. She looked over at me she held eye contact and stared back at me, when I broke eye contact didn't stop and watched me leave. She did this when my mom was right next to me. I broke eye contact and didn't look back. She didn't like that. Months later her and her mom go back on my fb to remove their likes on a pic dedicated to my dads death. Her mom liked my dad and she obviously talked about me to them because she found out that my dad bought a motorcycle from hers. After that she had an attitude, I worked with her, she stared at me while putting on a jacket and didn't stop when caught and the supervisor said something and she was shocked.

Well now we go to the same college she saw me when shes walking into her class and I was leaving that class she was showing up on time and sat down stared at me when I wasn't looking for a few seconds. Now after seeing me shows up 30 minutes early walks by looking in at me then walks by many times like 4+ times stands in the doorway then waits outside. Nobody does this and everyone else in her class is not there. Everyone else waits in their car between classes. Her friend acts like I don't exist when she sees me around and only went up to talk to me once. Her friend got a boyfriend and he lived right next door to me, she never said hi or anything.

I am just frustrated and upset in general because she never stops flirting with me in general and does it aggressively and when I ignore just persists and then eventually lashes out at me and does bad stuff. Then has some issue over stuff then lashes out at me. She never stops and just perists, she lashes out has an attitude over something stupid and starts up again. I get uncomfortable and ignore, she gets upset, angry and lashes me out. She showered me with so much attention, flattery and compliments. Selfies but I just can't get space or a break and when I get uncomfortable and ignore her or show negative body language/ response she just throws a fit and lashes out doing bad stuff. She acted like a supporting friend and shows support for stuff but then gets mad and take it away lashing out over that stuff. She just feels like a flirty big sister and using that dynamic to her advantage pushing me around and in a way bullying me. I just feel discouraged because I feel like she is the only female friend I really ever had. Her and her friend. Her friend would find any excuse to be around me and offered me a ride when it's unnecessary. She might know I am autistic because she is known for having a short fuse blowing up at people and she doesn't treat me that way and been extra patient wouldn't care if I interrupted her, ask questions on topics I am fixated with, instantly believe stuff I say take my side on stories when she was upset with me. Gets upset with me and then gets over it.

TL;DR

I met a girl when I was younger she did stuff that's impossible to ignore to get my attention. She continued this stuff for years and flirts to the point it is uncomfortable and doesn't stop then has an issue when I get mad or uncomfortable and ignore her and she lashes out. She does things that are impossible to ignore and continues this into college. Showing up 30 minutes early to her class when I am in the class before, and walking by a lot and standing in the door, waiting outside;

I honestly could learn all of this material on my own by myself. I’m not motivated to do any of the work because it seems like “life filler” as I like to call it. I don’t mind doing work I don’t want to do and I will work but I have experienced school to be primarily empty work. I feel like I’m just wasting away unhappy for no reason. For a degree? I never really got to love college like some other people. I feel like I’m really missing out. I have tried many times to be involved with the school but to my luck it ended in failure. I don’t connect really with anyone or any club on campus. I try and I really do try! Why is it so hard for me to see the worth and feel the excitement of college life? I admit I was always mature for my age. I’m 20 years old and I don’t like to party like typical 20 year olds. I guess, I’m more of a serious type. I’m miserable at school but as much as I’d love to drop out I can’t. I respect my parents too much to throw away their money like this. I hate sitting back and suffering in silence.

I did not apply origionally for CS because my father would not allow it and said he would pull all funding and kick me out of the house if I did. He's a narcissist with BPD, and thats a whole other story I really dont have the emotional energy to get into right now. I've recently told him to go fuck himself, and am deciding to do what I really love. I'm done trying to force myself into subjects I hate for absolutely no reason.

I've been stuck for years, I did 3 years at chemistry, and just changed to Geophysics. I still can't get into it. Its fascinating, but I just... I just want to do computer science.

Are there any universities(Pref, in cali) that will accept someone like me. I know how bad it looks to get into a UC and then bomb everything with half loads. I've attached my transcripts.

Where should I apply? If Anywhere. I tried going back to CC but the local one will not accept any of my UC or CC credits and wants me to start a new IGETC. I didn't push it hard though with the advisor. I just kinda mehed and left.

524,moonkie888,1549680353,/r/college/comments/aoo6wc/how_do_you_choose_a_major_if_youre_not_really/,"I’m a freshmen in college, and I’m just kind of stuck on what to choose to basically do with my life. I should also preface this by saying that I think it’s kind of dumb that straight out of college you’re expected to know what you want to do for the rest of you’re life. That concept is pretty dumb, but I’m going to have to deal with it.

Right now I’m a computer engineering major and I can’t say if it’s really that hard or not because I haven’t taken any major classes, and the biggest class I have is calculus. I’ve gotten to think that maybe Engineering isn’t for me, because you basically have to sacrifice you’re life to do it. Once second year hits, I have to take Calc 2, physics, statistics, and maybe an actual compe class. I mean I wouldn’t say I dislike math, but I don’t like it that much. It also doesn’t help that once I start my major classes, it’s going to be mainly guys in my classes. 

I’m basically only in engineering because my parents want me to, and bc I figured that engineering pays well and all that. It’s like a heavily respected profession, you make bank, and it sounds like you’re set for life. The only thing is, I couldn’t imagine the workload that I’m going to have to put myself through, so I’m been trying to find a major that interests me, but I don’t know what to choose. I saw the dead look on one of the faces of a senior who came into speak about how to succeed at school, and I can’t stop thinking of how empty he looked. This is a major that prides itself for overworking students, which is something that I’m starting to see a lot more.

My plan has been to just “go with it” but I’m kind of realizing that I’ll be to far behind if I choose a major later rather than sooner. I like animals, but I don’t think I’m that good at biology, so I haven’t really entertained that idea. If there was universal basic income or something like that, I think I’d probably be a dog walker, or a wildlife ranger. 

My other option is to go with cs, where I won’t have to take physics, electrical engineering, and I’ll just have to deal with math classes and cs. I think cs is supposed to be a notch down from computer engineering and most of the credits would transfer over nicely. I’ve tried to learn how to code, but the tutorial I’ve used just get so boring and tedious. I don’t know if that’s the nature of coding but I’ve found that it’s fun for a little and then it just gets frustrating and annoying.

I’m kind of stuck on whether I want the comfy office job or if I should go try to find a passion or something. Is there any advice that someone can offer? . It just feels like I’m joining the rat race, which is something I don’t really want. I feel like I’m playing the game and part of me wants to drop everything and actually do something with my life.

525,swswz,1549508469,/r/college/comments/anz55q/cannot_pay_attention_in_class_for_the_life_of_me/,"I’ve always had a problem paying attention in class for as long as I can remember. Well actually I don’t remember much of middle school, but high school I do remember pretty clearly.

In any class I didn’t have to pay attention, I simply didn’t. I would just so easily zone out and daydream. I would go on autopilot and take notes, and then review those notes when I had a quiz or test coming up.

However, as someone with anxiety, I somehow *always* paid attention in classes where teachers called on students randomly. Mainly because I never wanted to embarrass myself if I didn’t know the answer or was lost. And I usually did great in these classes - because I actually paid attention lol. In a weird way, my anxiety actually helped me in these classes because it sort of forced me to pay attention. 

Overall though, I did pretty well in high school. But in college I am struggling really hard due to my inability to pay attention. It’s like I have to teach myself to pay attention because I’m so used to not doing so in classes. I daydream so easily - about girls, or social scenarios, about my problems... usually that is what I’m thinking about. My mind just runs off. Also all my classes are basically big lecture halls, so there is no calling on randomly. It gives me the freedom to zone out.

And before anyone mentions it - I don’t think I have ADHD. Because this is really a class only problem. In any other case I pay attention. 

I’ve tried sitting up front (and I usually do sit near the front anyways) but it really does nothing for me. At this point I just don’t know what to do.

I have not had a good past year. I've been going through some pretty bad depression and anxiety and it's been getting worse.

I took fall 2018 off due to stress. I just worked and spent a vast majority of my time by myself. My mental health had gotten a little better, and I felt like I could be around people again. 

My hygeine was not up to par, but picked back up when school started. I started showering again, brushing, etc. But

I never would've thought my stress would be so bad that it   causes me to sweat so much even if I am sitting still in a cool room and smell absolutely terribly. I shower, wash clothes, deoderant, everything, but anxiety has started to make me sweat and SMELL. One of my professors made a comment about it during a lecture. It's that bad. So many people around me have turned around and stared at me, sniff throughout the class nonstop, make annoyed groans, etc. 


This just makes the anxiety worse. My depression and anxiety became 100x worse from before this semester, and I cannot communicate with people. I have a rude, antisocial resting face that makes me look unamused by everything and says, ""Get away from me."" I can't speak to any of my professors face-to-face because my body language says I don't want to be there and it's SO AWKWARD. One of them really hates me. And I constantly wonder if people can smell me or if people have started sniffing around me at all times as a joke. I seriously do; on days I KNOW for a fact I don't smell...

...I take a supplement that treats anxiety and works well enough if I take it before class to keep my sweat and body odor from going out of control. I can't take it everyday due to cost. This is the only thing I've tried so far that helps.

I've made a bad impression on everyone. People literally ignore me if I ask them for something like notes. People look away from me, purposefully sniff at me even thought I know I don't smell when I'm around campus. A guy came up to me the other day while I was walking to class to just sniff at me loudly and walk away again. I've noticed people do this intentionally to me now when I walk by them on the street. I am not imagining any of the people walking by who look in my direction and sniff at me or the ones who giggle or laugh at me.


People get over their insecurities and realize people respect each other more in college and forget about mistreatment in the past (if there was), but I've always been a very bullyable person. Every grade until graduation. I'm short, very young looking, and very unattractive. People are really laughing at me?

I really don't want to drop out, but I'm so fucking humiliated. I worked so hard to save up to cover the rest of my tuition this semester, but I want to just run away.

Everyone was seen as adults and the judgy bullshit that came with high school was gone. This is false. College is exactly the same, or at least freshman year is. 

My issue with high school was that it felt like everyone either went out and got drunk every night or never left the house. There wasn’t a ton of overlap in the two groups. College is worse in this regard. If you don’t drink, have fun sitting in the dorm all weekend. If you don’t smoke pot, have fun feeling left out. 

Bars and smoking are two of the biggest ways guys get to know each other at school. If you want to get to know people in the dorms, if you don’t drink or smoke, you’ll immediately be seen differently. You won’t meet anyone in your freshman classes because no one wants to be there. And clubs are a crapshoot. 

My advice is just be yourself. I tried to hard to make myself seem like a party animal the first semester when really I only like drinking sometimes. It was obvious I was projecting and it made it harder to make friends later on. Try and find people with similar interests, focus on school and if you like to drink, have fun.

I started my first semester of college in a completely new state very far from my family. I reconnected and strengthened my relationship with many of my friends and I finally found a place of belonging in my high school and social circle. I also started dating someone I really liked at the end of my senior year and we had an amazing summer together, but I feared going into college which would shatter the good feelings I felt at the time. 

I began school earlier than all my friends and I was completely alone. I didn't know anyone and I was over a thousand miles away from my home. I thought I knew what I wanted and I got into my dream school, but I was still so depressed. My roommate and I became good friends through shared experience, but there were times where she was truly horrible to me and it made me confused. I struggled to make friends at first even though I never really isolated myself. My roommate and I had a complicated relationship as time went on and I would feel crazy for disliking her, but she made feel unwelcome in my room and hurt me many times.

 My boyfriend and I did not break up and we have a very strong relationship, but being away from him was very difficult and I missed him a lot. It didn't help my roommate would get mad at me if he wanted to visit and would say antisemitic things about him to me and think it was all ok because we were ""friends."" I had a hard time with classes, even if they were easy. Due to a technical difficulty when registering for classes, I got no classes I signed up for. Not even second or third or fourth choices. 

Near the end of my semester, I finally had a good group of friends and tried harder in my classes. I had a routine and a very important friend and mentor came into my life. I talked to many interesting characters on the train going to visit my boyfriend and got some good connections from it too! 

Now that my winter break is ending, I realized I endured a lot last semester. I was active in a sport, despite feeling depressed and wanting to isolate myself. I have a wonderful and rewarding relationship with my boyfriend and I feel like, through the hardships of college and long distance, we became stronger and learned how to be independent. I also became close friends with the people at my boyfriend's uni and the city and school have become a third home to me. I got all my #1 classes about subjects I am super passionate about. I am excited to see my friends and team members. I am planning on getting a job and applying to internships with the help of friends in the same department. I plan on working harder in my classes.

531,StardustNyako,1546094948,/r/college/comments/aalquv/sharing_my_college_journey_in_hopes_that_it/,"Soo, I've had a non- traditional sort of journey, attempting to get through college. I debated whether or not to share this and was inspired by recent personal threads people have posted here to do so. Please understand though, this is word vomit and won't be well structured.

Soo, I went to an ultra competitive magnet school just to learn Japanese cause, I wanted to watch anime without subs.

Really I didn't have plans for high school or b what I would do after that. High school was just something I had to get through, along with college after that. Although I sorta knew I needed to take APs to look good for colleges, my school was literally number 2 in Texas. Classes were intense, even non honor classes, so I played it safe and decided not to take those AP classes. In reality, I should have just stayed at the school I was zoned to and got in the top 10 percent or atleast gonig there would have allowed me to feel safe taknig AP classes. That magnet school experience caused me to go from the confident smart girl to the kinda lost girl. This was my fault, I chose to stay at this school in hopes it would get me into a good college. It barely helped me at all.

I moved between my junior and senior year. Was going to get kicked out of this language magnet school anyway due to my grades in Algebra 2 and Physics. (LOL and yall are talking about taking Calc and I was still in Algebra 2 as a Junior lolololol). Moving to another state right before college app season hit added a whole layer of complexity and stress to the process. I was having to email my counselor, teachers and such, trying my damn best to line all my ducks up. But even then, there was so much out of my control, and I was not able to go to the school and meet with these people in person. I was needing to sit there and pray they understood what I needed from them. Well some schools didn't get everything they needed as a result of this mess. When all was said and done, I only got into UPitt cause they had other campuses they opened up to students they want to admiot but don't have room for at their main campus, and I got in at the campus I ranked as the campus I wanted to go to least.

That summer though , my mom lost her job, and even though she got one that payed an equal amount before I was supposed to go to college, she still asked that I start at a community college. So I did. I was happy I was saving money, but at the same time, the community college path tends to kinda make the college journey feel mroe stretched out and tedious than if you were to go to a 4 year to begin with, especially when your school has no classes linked to my major at the time Japanese. I had wanted to teach Japanese as a career, but finally came to my senses and decided this career path was not a good idea - I was never really able to connect with kids or get them to listen / respect me without another adult needing to step in. I also hated the idea of needing to teach the same lessons every year . . .I became lost as to what I really wanted to do, and knew I was just wasting my time at colleg, so I withdrew from my classes. I didn't think I was going back. I had done research and saw that college was not the olnly way to succeed

I went home , sat in front of my PC and tried to plan out my next move. However, it was difficult, because outside my door, my sister's new boyfriend was verbally abusing and taunting my nephew constantly, and giving him ruthless spankings that made the kid scream. I tried to stop that because I cared deeply for my nephew, however the boyfriend just got aggressive with me, told me to mind my own business, and made my own life hell, getting in my business, bossing me around over my life and what I could and couldn't do in the house. My mom didn't want to confront him or my sister, and so she just wanted me to listen to them. My mom also didn't want me getting mad at or criticizing my little sister who is autistic, and coddled by my mom, not getting the help she needs to succeed despite her handy cap, which she absolutely can succeed with the right help. She can communicate and learn , just slowly, but for a long time, people dragged their feet in pushing her. I just mention that all to paint the picture of the difficult home life I was dealing with while needing to forge a life for myself. Things got somewhat better but, still ehh

I remembered I'd always wanted to learn how to fix PCs, so I decided to go to trade school to learn how to fix PCs. I went to trade school for nine months, while working a part time job to pay for it. It was a tough time filled with hard work, but I got through it, and I'm damn proud of that. I earned two CompTIA certs: A+ and Network+. I had a contract job lined up before I graduated. However, after that contract job, I couldn't land any other job, all other companies wanted more experience or a degree . . .for a job that pays 12.50 an hour lol. So I gave in reluctantly and admitted I would need a degree to go forward since I wanted to work for a semi big company in an office. Why? My life even before this has been, insane, and, I just want to try to get back to some sort of ""normalcy"" .

I tried programming, realized I liked it. I began working on my AS in Comp Science at my local CC and I am finishing that now and am applying to 4 years to transfer, going through the application process again . So far I've had, better luck. My biggest dream is UMich as many of you know. My pre-withdrawng grades dropped my GPA some, but I am currently at a 3.46 GPA . . .hoping my essay are strong enough that UMich takes me. Two friends who helped me get through tough times go there, it'd be nice to study there with them.

This whole process taught me to have patience, and even though life can kinda throw you in to a crazy ride, hold on and ride it through, find beauty in the sites the ride takes you through, and do your best to understand why you are taking this ride and what can be gained from it. I gained patience, and a crazy strong determination to leave my house and make a life for myself with good friends and family. I never dreamed about my future before going down this path, now I feel like I'n working hard for a warm happy future, and it gives me the strength to keep going.

OKKKKK I'm done, sorrry for the masso post. Thank you so, so much for reading, hope you got someting out of that. Always wear your seat belt.

*Long* story, I apologize:

I am a first year college student in community college, who has been dealing with depression for a good portion of my life now. I started in 2017, and was supposed to be in my second year now, but I withdrew from one class my first semester, then withdrew from two in my second semester. My mental health was already pretty bad by that time, in the spring of 2018. Now, it's winter and things have definitely have *not* gotten better. I am on financial aid probation. I stopped going to classes back in November, a week before Thanksgiving vacation. It's been a *month*. I just don't think I'll be able to do it.

Over the summer, my parents revealed some things to me, basically saying how they wasted money on my therapy back in high school, how they regretted ever doing that for me, and things got physical. I did *not* lay a hand on my parents, only to grab their arms to get them off of me because they tried to choke me. My father has a bad temper and heart problems, so I wasn't trying to exert him and send him to a hospital or anything. I said some stuff to them about not being there for me emotionally and how they drove my other sister away because of how they treated her (lives across the goddamn country). It's been months since the summer and I still don't talk to them. They're the kind of people that are traditional and set in their ways, really. They think depression and anxiety is something you can just get rid of the next day and that I wake up everyday *choosing* to be depressed, because why the fuck not, right?

My other sister, who lives here in-state still, tried to tell me, ""Oh, they say stuff when they're angry, but they don't mean it.""

Which is total bullshit. That shit came from the heart, they were sobbing and crying, sad for themselves really. Because of how expensive the therapy and medication was.

It just made me feel like a huge, huge burden. I feel really alone here. I have been to counseling at school, spoken to my adviser and such, etc., but it can only so far. I can't tell them everything, even though it is confidential, there are just some things you can't say to them.

Everyday I wake up, after only having maybe one - three hours of sleep -- some days I don't sleep at all -- and I walk to the train station to catch my bus. I feel like shit, I'm tired and sluggish, I slur my words, and I sway back and forth -- it's ridiculous. I can't sleep all night because I have too much anxiety, it makes my heart beat fast and I just can't get relaxed enough to go to sleep. Hours pass by, I check my phone for the time, and the minutes just go by as I lay there. The sun comes up, I give up on trying to sleep and just get dressed for school. Sometimes, I even get nightmares -- wake up abruptly in the middle of the night and I *can't* go back to sleep. I'm always too tired to function, I feel bad that I have a hard time focusing in class. I just can't do it, I even get nauseous sometimes. It's really affecting my performance.

I used to think about killing myself and just ending it, getting it over with and done, because I know I'm a burden and that I will probably just never get better. I just think that's reality, that I will always be depressed, in the end. I'm never going to truly be happy.

I already had these dark thoughts before starting college, but it's just become more frequent now. Pretty much everyday, I wake up thinking ""God, I should just hurry up and kill myself."" It's weird, though, because in the back of my head, I know that it's a crazy thing to think about, but at the same time I can't stop. I'm just so tired. I'm *really, really* fucking tired.

I don't have a real support system, only my older sister who lives in-state still. I don't want to tell my friends about my predicament. It's just embarrassing to me, and I don't want to sound like a drama queen. It was also how I was raised? I was raised to not tell anyone my personal business, and now I can't knock the habit. It's so ingrained in me, but I've been trying (reached out to my adviser who helped me make an appointment with a counselor, etc.).

I don't know anymore. I feel genuinely hopeless. I can't help but feel that I shouldn't have been born. I am truly not meant to be here. I don't know what my purpose is, other than to be a depressed, anxiety-ridden person -- the cautionary tale.

I just don't think going to college still is doing me any favors. It's added to my stress. Maybe I just started college too early? Maybe I should have waited until I got better. But I didn't have the money to see a therapist during the time I wasn't in school, so I didn't know how long that would take. I think I just applied for college because I thought the clock was ticking and I needed to do something, rather than waiting to get better so that things could go smoother for me in college life... which was the wrong thing to do, I guess. I was just working and isolated myself from everyone. I thought I'd make friends in college, which I did, but I still feel alone.

I feel like killing myself everyday. My heart hurts, my body is tired, my mind is tired and numb, and I just don't have it in me anymore. I'm so exhausted. I tried, I really, really wanted to do good in school. I have never done this badly in school before (had a hiccup there in high school, was still depressed then, but my teachers made a compromise with me to keep me going so I could graduate), and seeing my grades drop made me feel like absolute shit. I just don't think I have a place in this world. I wake up just feeling worthless.

My problem isn’t the party scene, or getting distracted by friends/hobbies. In fact, I don’t have any friends at all. I pretty much just want to lay in my bed all day, and I’m ashamed of myself for it. 

I just don’t see the point in attending school, or learning in general. I used to actually study and was able to maintain a 4.0 my freshman and sophomore year. But ever since I was a junior, everything just seemed to fall apart and I stopped caring about doing poorly in class. 

I’ve had my teachers and parent’s ask me what’s wrong, and I just don’t know what it is. Whenever I try to get my act together, I will tend to lose focus quickly, get frustrated at my lack of focus, and then end up going to sleep while making no progress at all. I’ve tried everything from going to the library, turning off my phone/laptop, but I seem to get nothing done even when I do try my hardest. 

I know that if I actually tried, I would be able to accomplish a lot. Yet, the idea of getting good grades doesn’t feel very rewarding to me, and I feel like I could care less about school. 

Obviously, my mind is somewhere else and I don’t know how to get out of this slump. I’m pretty much just going to class and having my brain on auto-pilot. Even when I do tell myself to pull it together, I realize that I’ve focused so much on telling myself to focus, that I didn’t even listen to a word to what my professor said. I would much rather attend a CC then pay for a university that I’m practically wasting my time at. 

How can I pull myself together?

So the spring semester of this year was not good for me at all. I was hit hard with depression and anxiety after losing friends and losing a family member. I then was horribly alone and the depression kept getting in the way of everything and I eventually ended up trying to end my life. I then ended up in the psych hospital. I let my professors at the time know what was up so they were all aware and were ready to accommodate me. 

I tried getting back into the swing of things after getting out of the hospital, but I couldn’t. It was all too much. I tried to get my parents to let me withdraw and try again in the fall semester, but they said “No you’re fine you got this”, but I didn’t. I wanted to fix my own problems before focusing on school but they wouldn’t listen. So I failed every class. However I wrote to the dean who already knew of my situation and my financial aid and GPA were secured. I then went on to take 2 online summer classes (which I got As in both) so that helped.

I’m taking a gap semester this semester and I’m going back in the spring semester at the campus I can drive to that doesn’t have dorms. I think it’s for the best so I can just get out of school with my bachelors ASAP but I’m definitely finishing late. Probably a semester or two late. Im technically a junior but I’m behind credits wise. I know people finish late all the time but I keep comparing myself to everyone who finished/finishes on time. Should I feel bad?

535,Flankid,1545001036,/r/college/comments/a6tv49/how_do_i_get_over_the_fear_of_oneonone_convos/,"I'm a freshman in college and I find the whole office hours and ""talk to your professor one-on-one"" and scheduling meetings to discuss things very intimidating. I find it hard to talk to a professor about something for a couple of reasons. 

1. I feel like I have nothing valuable to say. I dont want to be that student who goes to a professors office hours just to talk about something they may not be interested in. Even though the professor maybe doing something that I am interested in, I either feel like they don't want to talk about it, they are leagues ahead of me in terms of what they know and I probably sound like an amateur noob, or they would rather simply help me with questions I have.
2. On the note about help with homework or assignments, I am not usually a person to go to a teacher to ask for help unless the internet and all books I have tried to go over did not clarify anything. More than often I see students go to office hours to get help but I very much prefer studying and tackling a difficult problem myself with help of the internet, youtube, and books. It feels stupid to go to a professor to ask for help when I can just watch a youtube video to answer my question.
3. It feels like I'm sucking up to the professor. I had students in my math class go to professor just to beg for a reschedule for the test or to get extra credit or ask in someway to improve their grade. If its on the syllabus, what more is there to ask? Just work for it. 
4. I dont know how to actually start a conversation. For example, I am currently going through an elementary analysis book myself and I wanted to go to my professor to a question about something related to it (since he was my calc professor) but part of me didn't want to go because I didn't know how to bring it up without sounding like I wanted him to know that I was being ""studious"" or what not.

If I dont resolve this issue, this is going to be detrimental because I am heavily considering going to grad school and I need to form relationships with professors.

536,shword,1544585039,/r/college/comments/a5e9tb/first_semester_done_and/,"Currently, I am sitting in my dorm room, procrastinating on studying for my finals, and I'm realizing with my first semester of college almost done, that I have no real friends.

I go to a really large public university in Wisconsin, so first off, it seems hard to initiate any sort of interactions, knowing I will most likely never see this person's face again. I don't really know how this happened, because I'm not terribly socially awkward, though I think I come off as kind of intimidating. I sometimes can have a sort of hater mentality, where I think everyone sucks and I wouldn't like any of them. Which I think a lot of the times is true, most people kind of do suck. I'm definitely an introvert, but I still want friends that I can become close with and spend time with.

I think the problem is I'm in a long-term relationship with my boyfriend, he goes to a school in the same city, so we hang out almost every day. Also, my mom and younger sister just recently moved to this same city, and I love spending time with my sister. So I already have two people to spend time with and who I already feel comfortable with. I think maybe I'm more of the ""sink or swim"" type of person when it comes to making friends, where I'll only make them out of sheer desperation and loneliness. But I'm seeing everyone in their groups of friends, eating Cheetos and studying together, and I want that.

I only had really one friend in high school, so maybe it's just me? I started an intramural basketball team here, and I really liked some of the people on my team, but after the season ended everyone stopped playing together. Maybe I should have tried to make more of an effort to hang out with them outside of basketball? But it seems like no one is making an effort to hang out with me. I texted one girl on the team and we hang out sometimes, but she's only like a ""going out"" friend, who I go to parties with. I don't think we could ever be real friends.

I took a year off after high school, so I'm older, and not to be pretentious but I think more mature, than most of the people I meet.

Also, I chose the dorm I live in specifically because it was known for being very social and fun, but I'm not close with my roommate and don't even know who lives across from me. And I'm in a specific freshman advising class, but didn't seem to hit it off with any of them, and when I have asked if anyone wants to study together in the group chat, no one will respond.

Sorry that this is just me complaining. I know it's not that bad, I just have heard from everyone that college is when you ""find your people"" and I want to find my people.

537,Pillprototype,1544493778,/r/college/comments/a52d4b/23f_on_the_verge_of_flunking_out/,"My first few years in college I watched my gpa drop after each semester and i assumed id just make it by doing the bare minimum. Every semester i told myself id do better next time and each semester I decided to be popular instead of remember why i was in college. I focused on popularity, and i was completely lost. 

In 2017 i was excluded from the university, and this was my wake up call. This lead me to turn my life around while out of school. I was able to reflect on my past decisions, appeal the exclusion, create a path with goals, landed an internship that will lead to a FT job once I graduate, i developed discipline and managed to lose over 40lbs quit drugs and alcohol without outside assistance. I felt unstoppable.
With this being my first semester back, school was a lot more difficult than I remembered. I took my first programming class towards my new major, alongside precalc. I thought i did fairly well in each class until finals week came around and i my professor started releasing previous tests grads. I calculated my grade and i am making a C in programming and a D in calc. This is discouraging because this is the first semester since i started college i can actually say ive tried and it still wasn’t good enough. 

The thing is with being back from exclusion, i must make at least a C+ in each class. Or i am excluded from the university and any other university that will not accept people in my position(which is almost all). If excluded i also lose my job because it is under the agreement that i am in school, and the exclusion this time cannot be appealed. I have worked with my programming professor and completed extra credit to get me to a C+ but that means nothing without the other grade. 

Since finding this information out i am unable to stomach food. I cannot sleep without taking tylenol pm ive dived full on back into the depression ive worked to hard to get out of. 
I cannot stop crying. Ive isolated myself, can’t leave the house, i cant have a conversation without lashing out, i cannot face my family this holiday season because school is always the topic and my graduation is well overdue. I know there are bigger problems in the world but this one just hurts me so bad. 

Ive scheduled a meeting with my calc professor to explain my situation, but being that ive only visited his office once before, and with it being one week after we took the final and me estimating my grade at a D, id be asking for a miracle to take me to a C+ to remain enrolled in the university. At this point i just dont know what to say to him. Im so ashamed and desparate i dont want to start crying in front of him but it’s inevitable. Ive completed online worksheets and emailed them to him earlier in the week to ask if they would be counted and possibly show him that i do grasp the material, im a terrible test taker. 
I definitely should have prevented this. I should have took time off work if i saw myself struggling I should’ve sought out a tutor but now my only option is to hope that he shows some sort of sympathy for me and i can have another chance. Any advice on how to proceed with speaking to him in the most respectful manor and getting him to help me would be greatly appreciated. This is a difficult topic for me right now and I honestly cannot take the rude comments so please be kind i know this is my doing but i have to at least try.

&amp;#x200B;

Finals started on friday. I've had a CS final that was really easy (but is also a joke class), and a final paper due in english which i turned in.

&amp;#x200B;

Other than these, not much is going well. My lowest grade going into this week was an A-. I took my calc 2 final after studying for endless days and nights and honestly think I bombed it. I tried so hard in this class this semester but its really all going to go to waste because of that.

&amp;#x200B;

I also took my history final exam today (or yesterday, I should say). It was supposed to be my ""easy A"" class, as said by other people, but I was aiming for a 92 to get an A- in the class. I studied a ton for this one as well. I'm not great with the humanities, and considering these tests were seen as super easy, a 93 isn't even any big deal apparently. I take the test, and get a 75. Not only do I not get an A-, but I also missed a B+ by .2%.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets be honest, the grades I'm getting are good and I'm not trying to flex or anything, but I feel I'm just getting mentally screwed at this point. I've got a lot of stuff going on with my family and I feel like I've been getting lowkey depressed lately because of how much I dont like where I am. I know I'm a smart guy but holy shit, why is everything falling apart now?? This is actually the most demotivated ive ever felt and I really dont know what to do about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I've mostly been aiming for just getting a good GPA this semester and finals are really making all the hard work go to waste. I'll likely get a 3.5 for the semester, which is good, but to be brutally honest this is nowhere near the GPA I need to be competitive for some of the schools I want to go to.

I failed two tests. 50% (avg was 71)and then a 35%(avg was 55).

It has got to a point where it’s hard to even be around people because I immediately get anxious. It gets to the point where it’s is sometimes difficult to breathe and I start to feel dizzy, even if I am just sitting down. The feeling goes away after I try to calm myself down, but comes back out of nowhere and for no particular reason. I’ve tried a lot of help dial it down, but it really does not help. 


So I’ve decided to actually get help. I’ve contacted my school’s counseling services for an appointment because it is free of charge, but the appointment is not until next month. That means I have to keep going to school in fear of or whilst having constant anxiety problems. 


I am left with either sticking it out and feeling like absolute shit every week or finding another specialist that may help me sooner. In either scenario, I feel as if it will be hard for me to go to the school until the day comes where I can actually get help.

My life has started to revolve around school and I've started to cut everyone off in my life and basically lock myself up in a room to study. My day consists of waking up to study, going to class and then going home to do homework that is assigned. I've never struggled this much in school before until this semester. It's really discouraging to realize that all the hard work you put in doesn't show when you receive a grade back from your professor. It has been eating me alive and it's extremely terrifying. I've never failed a class before, but I'm currently on the road of failing my classes this semester. 

&amp;#x200B;

College has taken a huge toll onto my depression. Likewise, my parents aren't really the most understanding the people in the world. I've talked to them about my depression before and received terrible responses. They got furious and told me to stop overreacting and basically to suck it up. I've been prescribed anti-depressants before, but they ultimately make me more anxious and give me the urge to kill myself. Since then, I haven't tried taking them again. I have been to several psychiatrists and feel like they haven't done much for me. It felt like a huge waste of time and money.

As registration starts to creep up for spring, I'm not quite sure of how to tell my parents that I'm literally failing all my classes this semester. They're the typical parents who would tell you that you aren't trying hard enough and call you lazy. Or flat out tell me to stop going to school altogether because I'm such a failure. I do not know how to go forth with this situation. I've had friends who told me to take a break from college and others who told me to take fewer units next semester so that it would be easier on me.

So today I had a test, and it was a pretty big one (20% of my grade I think), and I missed it. Why did I miss it? I missed it because it is the first day of snowfall here in upstate NY! So nobody knows how the hell to drive. Because of that, I have to suffer. There was a 20 car collision involving a track trailer and apparently there were fatalities. 

Well, the entire length of highway I need was pretty much shut down or at a stand still. I left my house at like 7:00 (preparing for this), and my test started around 9:15. I didn’t get on campus until 10:00, with only 15 minutes until the test ended.

I'm honestly at my wits end with this college. I've been here going on three years now and I just can't take the monotony and the lack of drive. People I know who should be striving to be at Yale or Berkeley or at a startup settle for a Genius Bar job at Apple to be considered for an internship, while they're in a CS program billed at being top of the line. Meanwhile in my own program we're rarely encouraged to get internships until senior year and if we ask through the school they without fail **must** be ""for credit"", rather than just helping people get internships for the sake of getting internships. 


The student population feels like hell. It's a majority commuter school, majority athlete, and majority international. You might be wondering ""what's the problem with that?"" Well we're not a D-1 school, and yet you have people clamouring that they're gonna go Division 1 and putting their sport above their education. If they want to do that, fine, but then the school should put them into something like a health science program or something that can fit into their schedule. It's not like these sports are making money, so I really don't even understand the economics of having them. 


You have a large cohort of international students from a region of the world that culturally is very insular, and they do not make any attempts to interact with the local student body. Instead, they get a student organization all to themselves that they won't even (supposedly) allow other international students to join, nor domestic students. It meets pretty much every day informally, and domestic students are allowed maybe one or two outings with the group per academic year.


The heavy influx of commuter students means their needs get put above ours and the lack of community is striking. It's a campus. It exists. It does not have any life. I grew up thinking I was going to get into Berkeley and here I am at a relatively nothing college. I'm thankful to have even gotten into *a* college, I recognize the privilege, but fuck if it doesn't feel worthless actually being here on the day-to-day.


I have attempted to make friends here to no avail, many of my friends at in their mid-late 20s. I genuinely do not understand why this school even exists. It's billed as a great institution which, sure it might be academically but it has fuck all if you're actually living here and want to get involved. 


I've tried starting up clubs. I've tried going out to events that rarely get advertised. I've tried talking to the international students only to get ignored because I don't speak their language and they don't have any desire to speak English. The friends I do have I barely agree with politically or socially, they're more just friends of convenience than anything else. One is a roommate who doesn't care if he skips his classes for an entire week straight, the other is some borderline MGTOW person who I barely even want to associate with anymore, and have nearly cut off all contact.


To give some perspective, freshman year I was assaulted and made to be a hermit. I pretty much have not had a stable social life with peers my age my entire life, and college was supposed to change that. Apparently I didn't work hard enough, so I got what I deserved I guess. 


I'm considering going to Korea to study abroad, but due to funding limitations and not wanting to go into insane amounts of debt I genuinely am not sure I can afford it right now so will be holding off. The one silver lining to all of this, I guess, is that I can say fuck you to this city and leave after I graduate without a whole lot of debt, maybe come back in a year or two after I've gotten some breathing room. Maybe come back for holidays to see friends, who tf knows. I'm just so fucking sick of this atmosphere of mediocrity and as though I'm somehow the ""other"".

I didn't care at all when I was younger and never tried in school, so I'm trying to develop good study habits for the first time ever and actually apply myself. 

So far, I have a 4.0, but granted they've all been easier Gen-Eds, I'd say. I have one week left in my classes, but I can't focus to save my life. One of my classes is Accelerated Algebra as I never learned basic math. It was fine until we started factoring polynomials and graphing inequalities, and now I feel like I don't understand anything. 

I literally sit there staring at my text and homework. I know to take breaks here and there, so it's not like I'm working myself too much. It feels like I'm reading a different language, and I straight up can't get anything done. I have a quiz, a test, and a final due by Wednesday next week all over polynomials and graphing and I'm spooked. 

I do suffer from chronic depression, but I don't know if this is because of that or what. I'm just scared. If I can barely understand polynomials in a basic ass Algebra class, how am I supposed to understand tougher classes, like Chem and Biomechanics?

I get excited thinking about these future classes, because for once in my life I have a goal I'm working towards, but I'm worried I'm not good enough. I'm worried I won't be able to apply myself, that I don't have the mental capacity to do this. I'm loving college so far, but all I can think about are my other life struggles (toxic family, car issues, etc) and it's hard.

When we first got to school, she was okay I guess. But I learned really quickly just how oblivious she is. It started with talking, she’d get back while I was doing homework, I’d say I was doing homework, and then she’d proceed to talk for 30 minutes straight. Obviously, I stopped doing homework in my own room, because I didn’t need the distraction. 

I joined a sorority and spend a lot of time there so I’ve been slowly spending as little time in the room as I can, aside from sleeping. I’m a night owl, so I get back to our room pretty late, but I always try to be as quiet as I possibly can. At first, I didn’t even take my makeup off because I didn’t want to turn the light on at 3 am. All of her classes are before mine, so she tends to leave before me, waking me up in the process. Mind you, I’m a pretty heavy sleeper, but she wakes me up all the time slamming doors. 

I wouldn’t even be that upset, if I haven’t been making a point to turn the knob and close doors even when this bitch is awake. But this morning, she slammed the door so hard, the walls shook. Obviously, it woke me up, but I’m starting to think that she’s doing it on purpose, because nobody is that stupid and obvious. I’ve also told her that I have chronic migraines and that I tend to wake up with them, but that has not stopped her from making as much noise as possible in the morning. She used to play the “I didn’t see you there” bullshit but it’s been weeks and that shit doesn’t fly anymore. 

I try to slyly add in to conversation that it’s annoying and unnecessary, without being mean, because I don’t like confrontation. But it’s to the point where I’m so aggravated that she’s causing me migraines, which means I can’t go to my morning class. 

To add salt to the wound, I recently got a body pillow and she told me that every time she comes in, she thinks I’m napping and it’s just the body pillow. She told me how cautious she is when she thinks I’m napping, only to realize it’s a pillow. How the actual fuck does she respect my pillow sleeping more than me? It just leads me to believe that she’s not just some dumb, oblivious airhead, but that maybe she hates that I come in late all the time? Even though I’m as considerate as I can possibly be when she’s sleeping. 

She also accidentally spilled under my dresser, but I didn’t know for a while. The dressers are wooden and water and wood don’t mix. When I realized it, I cleaned it up immediately, with her in the room. I tried to find the source of the spill, which was one of two of her water bottles because that was the only thing that could’ve spilled in that vicinity. Angrily, I pulled them out and set them by her stuff. She proceeded to ask me what spilled, and I scuffed an, “I don’t know,” with a nasty glare to her and the water bottles. She continued to play dumb, and never apologized for her mess I had to clean up, while she watched me. 
My sorority sisters have been telling me to do the same back, not really caring about her wellbeing or space since she doesn’t do the same for me. The semester will be over in a few weeks and I am able to move out, so I feel as though now is the perfect time to unleash. I feel it’s important to add again that I have tried to make it known to her multiple times (without saying it flat out bc who needs to be told not to slam doors with someone is asleep), but I don’t like confrontation so I haven’t directly addressed the problem. I feel like by now though, it’s pretty clear why I’m annoyed and that maybe it isn’t oblivion. 

What should I do? I want her to feel my pain but I hate being mean. I’ve slammed the doors a few times when she’s been napping, because leading by example did absolutely nothing. I don’t want to be rude, but I know that my efforts have gone unnoticed and I’m sick of trying to be extremely considerate just to receive the opposite back.

553,limitedliminality,1541279513,/r/college/comments/9txqwx/exaddict_has_questions_about_returning_to_school/,"Hey Reddit! quite a long store so please bear with me. I'm asking a few questions in regards to my future and what possible paths I should take in relation to going back to college. 

I grew up in East-Side Detroit. Instead of learning from the crackheads and junkies around me, I'd figured “oh that shit could never be me”. When I was around fourteen years old I'd already drank and smoked week a little. At fifteen I'd tried a little coke and liked it. During the same time I tried coke second time and my friends and I ended up passing out on some swings in a park and puking our asses off the falling asleep. Turns out this was heroin. 

Right around the time I turned sixteen I started shooting up heroin because It was the cheapest, longest lasting high I could get besides weed and alcohol, neither of which I enjoyed. Over the next year and a half this consumed my life and went from a couple time a week thing to an all-day-every-day type thing.

Parallel to this was my schooling. I'd always been a smart kid even without trying very hard. Busted out A's like it was nobodies business. As I was starting to use dope more, I ended up getting the Highest ACT score in my school. Not a perfect score but far from doing poorly. The school was very surprised by my grades and was apparently just starting to receive funding for a duel enrollment program. Long story short, I ended up doing about five semesters of Community College towards a CS degree ( I had no idea what I wanted to do for a major tbh and would never pursue this). A portion of this was paid for by the High-School. A portion of this was paid for by grants, and the fact that my mother was incarcerated in Ohio for most of my childhood. 

The issue with my time in college is that as I started using more heroin I did increasingly worse in school. Ended up dropping I'd say about half my classes after the first year, and if I didn't drop them I just wouldn't show up. I'm sure I have a pretty bad GPA at this point.

Skip ahead a few years, decided college wasn't worth it while using dope, spent six years of so shooting up, destroyed a relationship of the same length. I had friends(a couple) who said they'd help me get sober from the heroin and as long as I lived by their house rules I'd have no problems there and not have to pay them rent for the first three months. I lived in Michigan, They lived in GA. I ended up getting a ride to GA, stayed sober I want to say for around 2 years. Had one relapse on and off about a week long.  I'm about a year and 8 or so months sober again. I'm about to turn 26 now, still residing in GA, with a total sober time about 3 years 8mo.

Right now I'm in a position for the first time since becoming sober where I've knocked out my short term goals and am setting up long term goals. I'm in a relationship with a very sweet woman. We are living together with her family to save money (rent free) for the time being. She has a four year Bio-Med degree and wants to do post grad at St. Jude's in Tennessee next fall. Right now I'm currently in school for medical billing &amp; coding. I'm about 60 percent to 70% done with the course and on my way to get certified and currently have a 4.0.

 After working a bit at healthcare, and seeing it from the patient side (as an addict) I've spent the last few months trying to figure out what I want for myself in the future. I've always loved healthcare and helping others. Medicine is fascinating to me and the ability to help others through some of the worst times in their lives seems so gratifying. I've come to the conclusion to finish my billing/coding cert, work my ass off to save up money until we move. Once in Tennessee I'd like to pursue one of two paths. 

Path One: Take a BSN (Bachelor of Science in Nursing) program then apply for Med-school and work at that then residency, fellowship, etc. 

Path Two: Complete an ADN(Associates Degree in Nursing), do a RN to BSN program.  Gain experience as a RN and work at becoming a NP(Nurse Practitioner) and then DNP(Doctorate) program. I'm not sure which I'd like more but I want the end of the road mapped out before I even set foot in a school.

So here are a list of my questions.

 
1. Will my past as a junkie hurt/hinder my ability or chances to do med-school/a nursing program? I never got in any trouble for it legally.


2. I have no Credit built, should I start building some now? I'll save some money from now until fall, but I'll surely need student loans to complete either path.


3. Will my past mishaps in my first college (dropping probably half the classes due to drug use) hurt my ability to go to a college now? Is there any way to get those scores thrown out? Will I have to take some extra courses to balance my GPA or something? Will a College even accept me? Do I even Have to submit my old college scores?


4. If schools to use my old GPA, does my 4.0 in my Certificate now influence my old GPA?


5. I've not taken a class in English, Math, Science, etc in years now. Would it be worth it to get into a ACT study program and retake it? I feel like this may refresh my memory on some old concepts and It couldn't hurt aiming for a better score.


6. Does Tennessee accept ACT scores or do I need an SAT score coming from out of state?


7. If anyone is around the Memphis Area, what schools would you recommend for me after hearing my story?

I’m depressed and currently in treatment. One of the triggers of my stress and depression is missing out on the college experience. I was never popular on high school, never went to parties. I wasted most of my youth indoors, but honestly I even prefer that over the experience I have now since I still had close friendships. It’s not only the wild parties and drinking that I’m missing out on but the community, networking and close friendships. I have friends in NYU, but the campus is so spread out and everyone is so busy I feel very isolated, no matter how much I reach out. I am not meeting new people because I just go to bars and clubs with working adults that have no time for a connection. I’ve tried joining clubs and sport teams and yet nothing. I attempted to give NYU a try but after two years I’m still depressed and lonely. I feel like I’m missing out on my youth and it’s affecting my grades as that part of my life is unfulfilled and i can’t concentrate on anything but that. I resent my parents who pressured me to go here for the prestige and everyone who told me nyc would be “so much fun”. My GPA is shit and I don’t enjoy or have motivation for anything I do there. The only thing keeping me here is the name and the fact that I’m already a junior and everyone has made their friends and got out all their freshman and sophomore partying and having fun. I’m afraid it’s just too late and I’d be sacrificing too much to go to a lesser prestige school and feel the same social isolation and missing out on things, or not feel it enough as i only have two years left. I don’t know what to do. I’d honestly start again as a freshman if it had the chance but i don’t think that’s plausible. 
And i hate when people tell me “it’s not because of the school it’s because of you”. Yeah i know I’m social anxious, shy and have a hard time making friends but I’ve seen the shyest most socially isolated people thrive and feel accepted at other colleges with small and welcoming campuses.

Not going for the MEng:
Pros: 
- Won't be 40k in debt
- If I get a job, I'll be making money earlier than I would've staying in school

Cons:
- Resume is kinda underwhelming, will probably be hard to get a job. I didn't get internships during my 4 years as an undergrad so all I really have to go off of is independent projects and some related work (not internships but things where I coded for a job). If I took the Masters program I'd have way more project experience that'd help build my resume
- Can't apply for internships.



Going for the MEng:

Pros:
- Students in the program do alot of project work with professors and other students, so I could get a lot of CS experience that'll help me and my resume out
- Have another opportunity to apply for internships. 

Cons:
- 40k in debt

I'm a senior at a great university.

Basically, if I graduate as my current grades stand, I'm screwed. While I tried my best, my chem and genetics classes killed my gpa. The advisory center told me it was fine since ""because it is such a good university, employers understand how rigorous the classes are...' I recently met up with a professor who helps students get into med school, etc She helped me to see how screwed I was and....

With my wildlife/biology background from my prior major, I thought a business major with some emphasis on organizational behavior would tie together really well to ACTUALLY get a good job after school. Does anybody know of any resources I could look at to help which direction I should pursue at business school? or things I should include when trying to persuade the adviser to take a chance on me? or people who have successful careers tied into business?

A professor recommended me to go to our business school and see if I could switch majors or double major. Business is always something I've enjoyed and I was going to take a beginning entrepreneurship class next semester just for fun!

I already have taken accounting and other prereqs and have been very successful. I figure if I can do well in business, employers prob won't care about my previous bio grades....

I came from a single parent home and grew up in poverty. After working so hard to get to college and working my butt off to just graduate without a job and be back in the cycle of poverty is what frightens me the most. PLEASE HELP.

My GPA is not what it needs to be to get into the grad schools I want, especially my science-specific GPA which is the important one. I switched to an easier major for me for a number of reasons, yet I can’t seem to pass physics with above a 30 despite taking mostly classes I find easy.

I’m struggling really hard right now and I feel like I have no purpose. I don’t see the point in trying anymore since it seems inevitable I won’t get into grad school. I’m also concerned because my new major seems useless if I don’t get into grad school because it otherwise applies to something I don’t want to do with my life. I know this is “giving up” but every semester of college thus far (I’m a junior) I have tried ridiculously hard and done mediocre/poor in the majority of my classes.

I don’t know what to do. I’ve had pretty bad test anxiety since middle school that I can’t seem to kick. I have anxiety attacks about this sort of existential stuff all the time, and I’m reaching my breaking point.

I’m starting to wonder if college just isn’t for me, but I value education a great deal and I enjoy going to classes. I just can’t seem to grasp anything. Nothing sticks. And my study habits are pretty good, so I’m not sure what is wrong with me.

Long story short, I don’t know if withdrawing for next semester/altogether is a bad idea. I also realize this was a big jumble of thoughts. Any advice would be appreciated.

I don’t even know if it’s possible transfer credits that way, when I try to look it up all I see is articles on transferring normally(CC to Uni) 

I want to transfer because the work is really hard and stressful even though I’m only taking introductory classes at the moment. I don’t know if I can handle it for 4 years. It feels like it’s gonna take everything I have to just to get through the semester. Also I don’t feel invested as I don’t know what I want to study and I have no interests.

Some Background (sorry if it’s too long): After high school I went to a college that specializes in Criminal Justice, I wasn’t particularly interested in that field but I just went because I didn’t know what to do otherwise/it was the best school I got into. I only went one day, then dropped out(don’t even know if that counts as dropping) mostly because I didn’t want to put in effort for a degree I didn’t care for and I knew the quality of my work wouldn’t have been great either. 

After that I tried to apply to community college and try to become a paramedic. Got accepted but then I found out that I couldn’t apply for classes because I still had debt from my last school(schools here in nyc are cheap and the financial aid covers all of the tuition but since I dropped out I had to pay some of the aid back.) I also talked myself out of being a paramedic because the my anxiety is so bad that I wouldn’t trust myself to handle injured/sick people.

So I ended not going to college at all in that time and did nothing for 3 years. Staying at home mostly. My mom was reluctantly supportive, she didn’t want to push me to do something I didn’t want to. I was(still am) dealing with all sorts of health issues, mostly mental. I couldn’t take not doing anything anymore, seeing all my high school friends doing meaningful things with their lives while I did nothing was killing me.

Now I’m in college again, still without clue of what to do. The work is really hard, tedious and time consuming. The commute to my college is an hour and a half, and I have an 8am class Tus/Thurs because they didn’t let us pick out classes and times just for this semester. Lab class for physics is a disaster as my instructor is crap and I’m just a dead weight lab partner. Took my first exam today for physics lecture and felt like I was gonna vomit in class because my anxiety was so bad.

I feel like I’ve wasted so much time out of my life. Considering just learning a trade of some sort from a community college and just going from there.

I went to a small high school where I had a really big group of close friends. We would all hang out and party all the time. I was the star of the soccer and track teams and everyone knew me as an athlete and a funny kid.
Now im not saying I wish to go back to high school but so far college has been a drag and Im not having a fun time.

I go to school about a hour away from home. I dont have my car at school and my parents bring me home for a night almost every weekend. Im on the soccer team and having my ups and downs but its going mostly well there.

I miss my friends terribly all the time, and Im having a of trouble making new ones. All my friends are hanging out and throwing parties on their dorm floor, and i feel im missing out. I know nobody on the dorm floor and ive inly made one or two friends in my classes.
Nobody sees to wantto reach out or do anything. Ive tried reaching out to people and setting up hangouts but nobody ever wanted to so now ive given up even on that.

I basically go to class, go to the library and then go bac to my room and sleep every single day. This is only broken up by my soccer games and practices, but even those I have come to hate because they interfere heavily with my ability to come home on the weekends.

I like for the few days a month I can spend at home. I miss my family constantly, I spend at least an hour a day on the phone with my parents and whenever i come home I make sure to spend as much time as I can hanging out with my handful of high school friends who stayed local.

The college food here is getting old fast and half the time I dont even eat anything. Im even starting to lose the motivation to do my schooleork. Im just counting down the days until everybody will be home for Thanksgiving again.

Sometimes i think i made the wrong choice of school. I go to a very free-thinking school, and many of the kids that go here are either LGBT or inner city type kids. Now i have no issues at all with that and I seek no problems with anyone, but as somebdy who grew up in a very sheltered town, I find it very hard to identify and really connect with most kids here

561,ProperQuiet,1538786806,/r/college/comments/9lrx9n/anybody_have_tips_for_dealing_with_depression_and/,"TL;DR: Any advice for coping with depression and anxiety along with the stress of college?

I'm in my 4th year of school (but I'm a junior). I have depression and anxiety. Since spring 2017 it has affected my school work in a way it never has before. I can't seem to remember things, I can't focus, my mind is very foggy, I can't find the motivation to go to class and I've been quickly falling further and further behind. I get psychiatric disability accommodations now because of how much it was affecting my ability to work. 

I don't even know what to do. For the past 3 weeks I've missed my morning class because I can't wake myself up; I end up laying in bed for hours. If it were up to me I wouldn't take these classes, especially since I'm off campus so I must get up even earlier, but it's a required course that is taught only in the fall and only at 8 am. 

I try to study but it is exhausting. I quickly become distracted even in the most distraction free environments - the distractions are inside my head. My mind gets foggy while reading and suddenly the words on the page mean nothing. Of course I can read the words and know what they mean individually but I can't seem to put the ideas together in a way that makes sense; it all becomes gibberish. If I try to think about things I quickly lose my train of thought and no matter how hard I try to focus; other intrusive thoughts seem to jump in. It's not like there are voices in my head but it's hard to explain. 

Lastly, my memory is shot. I mix up or can't recall a lot of material; I mix up due dates. I lose track of time, a week can go by and it barely feels like time has passed. I don't realize how much time has passed until I see I only have 2 days left for an assignment I was given last week; that's how bad it is. I'm just in this constant haze and can't think clearly.

I've been in and out of counselling. The most I can really afford on my own are the therapy services at my university which aren't necessarily the best but it's the best I've got. I don't take meds because I haven't had the best experiences in the past. Lexapro was okay until it wasn't; it made me tired so I slept better but that was it. I went to another doctor who added vyvanse (for my supposed BED) which worsened my anxiety which worsened my depression and suddenly the lexapro wasn't doing anything at all. Then I was on Zoloft for a split second and at the same time I was on Trazodone to help with insomnia; I'd sleep all day and was extremely fatigued and it all just increased the foggy feeling. Lastly I tried Effexor which was the worse of them all. I was experiencing some pretty bad ""brain zap"" on that, weird visual effects I can't describe, nausea, I was both very fatigued yet couldn't sleep at the same time, dizziness, and just felt very sick. Effexor was hell for me. So I don't really want to try any other meds.

562,ogp1,1538704424,/r/college/comments/9li4vz/looking_for_advice_on_choosing_a_college_with/,"Hey all, sorry for the wall of text but I put a tl;dr at the bottom if you want to read my questions.

Firstly, I (Asian male living in Georgia) am currently a junior in a high school doing a dual enrollment (DE) program full time at Kennesaw State University. I have planned my dual enrollment courses to be able to transfer to Georgia Tech, which is ultimately my ""dream college"" where I plan on majoring in Aerospace engineering. The thing is, I feel like I am reaching too far (with my academics, test scores, and extracurricular/volunteer work) and that GA Tech wouldn't accept me.

GPA and extracurriculars-
So far I have a 4.0 unweighted GPA (after taking 1 AP course and honors classes my freshman year and 2 AP courses and honors classes my sophomore year) but with Fall 2018 semester (my first year as a DE student) I am anticipating a B in History 2112. History has never been hard for me, but I am struggling with this class because of the way that the tests are made.

I have been an A student in high school, but I am anticipating some B's in the upcoming semesters. I know its possible to get into GA Tech without a 4.0 GPA, but I feel like not having one would put me at a huge disadvantage if I tried to apply because I do not yet have any volunteer hours or participate in any extracurriculars. I am planning on finding a part time job, maybe joining a club at KSU, and volunteering in the 2019 Spring semester but I do not know how the workload will be then or how my schedule would work.

Majoring in Aerospace engineering-
GA Tech is the first college on my list because I have not found any other colleges in Georgia that offer a bachelor's in Aerospace engineering. I prefer a college in GA, but I feel like I don't have many options here for this major. 

Aerospace is a field that I am interested in, but after reading posts it seems like finding a job in GA with this degree would be difficult or would lack security. Bachelor's in mechanical engineering is a major that is way more common in GA colleges and is probably safer than aerospace due to the fact that it encompasses so many other industries, so I am conflicted as to what major I should pick; I know that aerospace and mechanical engineers take the same core classes though so it might be possible to get an engineering related job with an aerospace degree. I also know that there are mechanical engineers that work in the aerospace industry but I don't think its necessarily the right option if I want to work in that field. 
Narrowing down on a major would help me narrow down my college search a ton.

Questions in summary:

1. If I were to begin extracurriculars and volunteer work Spring semester as a junior in high school with DE credits and less than a 4.0 unweighted GPA, what are the prospects of me getting accepted to GA Tech?

2. What other colleges (preferably in state, but out of state if I need to) with a bachelor's in aerospace engineering would be a good option for me where I stand as a student with OK but not special academics and little extracurricular or volunteer experience?

3. Would a bachelor's in mechanical engineering be safer in regards to finding a job over aerospace?",college,Looking for advice on choosing a college with where I stand with academics and extracurriculars,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/9li4vz/looking_for_advice_on_choosing_a_college_with/,1538722424.0

However, I was so busy my senior year that I kept putting college applications aside and did not do any college tours so I applied to a safe (but relatively high ranking) school that I did not know much about and ended up hating it. I did not party at all, made almost no friends, despised the college traditions, and ended up with a really bad GPA (2.0) even though I tried my best to study as hard as I could. I became really depressed, lonely, and homesick during this year as well as going through my parent's divorce and a break-up early on the fall.

It was the year where everyone got cars, the world was ours. I started working out and breaking out of my shell. I started going to parties and I made so many friends that year and only got closer with my old friends. Our entire grade just felt like a community. I just remember everyday I would just be walking through the halls or in class with my friends and it was nonstop giggling and joking. Life was great and it just culminated with an amazing prom and summer.        
           
Then college started. That august everyone packed their bags and instantly forgot about their old lives, everyone made their new friends, completely moved on and never wanted to look back.

Eventually I just got burnt out physically and emotionally trying and most of the year was spent just sitting in my room, doing nothing.          
I did make a few friends but were really not super close, I care about any of my home friends way more.

I’m a sophomore now and I went into college thinking I’d be a journalist but I tried out our on campus publication and hated everything about it- besides writing, so I ended up quitting after a semester. 

Right now I have an internship managing the social media for a college company and it’s really chill and awesome. 

I’m definitely the creative type, and I love and am good at writing. I’m only concerned that communications in itself will not put me in an ideal situation in the job world. 

I was considering an English major as well, since I’m pretty good at that stuff, but don’t know if that’s just a waste of time - being an editor sound appealing, as well as an author (highly unlikely I know) which I guess this major would help with. 

I’m also considering a minor in writing for the screen, since my ideal future job would be a television show writer or something involved with that. 

Despite what I’ve said - any comm double or single majors have any advice or ideas on a beneficial double major? I’m just not a math or science person and could barely handle those classes in high school - so highly unlikely I could obtain a STEM degree at a hard school. 

Tl;dr: I want to major in communications, but am looking for suggestions of a double major to supplement it.

Before I go back to school, I need to fix this, I've been out of school for around 3 years now.

The good news is that I've come up with a plan, the bad news is that I've learned it's a terrible plan.

I've bought 3 workbook, a calculus workbook, a French workbook, and a book full of writing prompts. I planned on doing one page of Calulus a day, one page of French a day, and one writing prompt a week to simulate writing an essay. And if I can keep this up for long enough, maybe I'll enroll in classes again. I thought that would be good enough, I'd follow along with the book do the problems and have smooth sailing. What I didn't realize was that I don't think that I can learn calculus from a book, or at least not this book. I bought the Schaum's outlines Calculus 6th edition, and this thing is dry as dry can be. I'm trying to follow along, I really am, but I'm just left frustrated feeling like I'm not trying hard enough. Calculus was where I left off, I took AP PreCalc in high school and took Calculus my first semester of college (before dropping out because I wouldn't do the homework.). The teacher even tried to encourage me by telling me that I was doing well in class she knew that I understood it I just needed to do the homework. I can understand Calculus, but trying learn it from a book just isn't the way I guess. My roommate recommended using Khan academy, but I didn't have much success using it to try and follow along with this book.

I'm honestly just really frustrated right now, I really just want to turn my brain off and go to sleep, or catch up on GoT. But I'm trying to force myself through it, and practice self discipline. But I really feel like I've hit a wall and I don't know what to do. Do any of you guys have any recomendations? Perhaps a better book that I can follow along to? Maybe some obscure YouTube series that I couldn't find that follows along with this book? Maybe better ways to practice doing homework? I really need some help here, I don't want to give up, but I'm really fighting the urge to.

A few semesters ago I had a lowkey stalker. Now, I call him lowkey because the stalking never went outside school property or texting. But I had this guy in my class and early on in the semester we shared phone numbers (something I would soon come to regret, but at the time felt harmless). I was in no way interested in this guy, and I told him so the first time we talked, but he did not let up. He kept insisting he could see us developing a relationship together. So I did the only thing I could think of and blocked him. The only problem was that we were still in the same class together. At first, I just ignored him as best I could, but he would stare at me in class constantly, no matter where he or I was sitting. After that, he started to follow me around the school, to the point where I would get in my car and leave, or the second I saw him would practically run away and go into a bathroom with other people. He never actually tried anything, but I felt anxious every time I saw him. Finally I told my professor about the problem because I just couldn't take the stress any longer. I filled out an incident report and then got security escorts to my car the remainder of the semester, and he was never a problem again.

The moral of this story I guess is that even though nothing happened to me, it could very easily happen to someone else. So if someone makes you feel uncomfortable for any reason, DO NOT be afraid to report it or ask someone what to do. Whether it's to campus security, your professor, counselor, advisor, whoever, just don't wait until it's too late.

I couldn't get the motivation needed to do the work, despite knowing how important it was.

Finally, college arrived, and I thought I could FINALLY make a change. It ended up same way as before...

I asked for help, and my counselor showed me to a Disability Program, and I learned that I was suffering from a mental disability, mainly ADHD. My Dad knew, and he did nothing to help me. Refuses to do so now.

So I figured if I can do everything I can, I could at the bare minimum get by. Yeah...

Disability service is taking to long to help me, they put me on hold for a whole month, and I still don't get any help. I got booted from one of my online classes, and everything completely sucks. I'm on my last leg, and its not a stable one.

I even thought about breaking from College, but since my Dad likes to be a complete dick, I can't take a break, nor can I quit. Yes, I tried standing up for myself, and no, it didn't work. He's a stubborn man who refuses to change his mind.

So, here I am. In class typing to Reddit about my frustrations.

TL;DR: I hate school because disability. Tried to get help, and nothings working. Can't quit because of one of my parents is being to stubborn to let me make my own choice. Yes, I tried standing up. No, it didn't work, and my head is sore. &gt;Everybody do the Dinosaur&lt;",college,I hate college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/9f12cp/i_hate_college/,1536715634.0
571,derp106,1536513013,/r/college/comments/9eelw1/dropping_out_of_college_midsemester/,"Hi!

I’m currently a first-year at my college. For several reasons, I want to drop out so, so badly. I would go into detail, but the gist of it is that I find myself extremely mentally unstable here (which I never have been, ever in my life) and frankly I’m scaring myself with my own thoughts, I wake up every morning dreading my decision to come here, I feel trapped, isolated, and I just feel terrible all the time and I don’t fit in with the college atmosphere at all. I chose this college because it was cheaper (they gave me a ton of financial aid) than going to a UC, and in general they just have loads of funding to offer to low-income students (it’s an incredibly wealthy liberal arts college). There isn’t any other reason — I literally cried the day I committed to this school because I knew it wasn’t for me. I know I’m fucking dumb for even choosing it in the first place, but it just made sense at the time to choose this school because of the money and... prestige/uniqueness?, since I’d be the only one in my family/friend group going out-of-state for college and it’s quite a selective college. But every day, when I wake up and realize where I am, I regret everything so much and I just burst into tears in random spurs throughout the day. I feel like shit and not like myself, and I know the only remedy for this is to go back home. 

The original plan was to stick it through for one semester, drop out then, go back home and enroll in community college for the spring, then transfer to a university in my state after I got my AA degree, but I’m not even sure if I can last one semester here. I promised myself I’d give it at least a month, before the drop-period ends (October 14th), so if I do decide to leave, I can leave with a clean transcript &amp; get a partial tuition refund for my parents. Again though, I’ve talked to people and everyone tells me the same thing: give it time, find your people, join clubs, be social, come with an open mind, etc. And I completely get it, I know it takes time to adjust to any new environment whatsoever, but I just feel like my situation is different because I came to this school with, like, already this inherent hatred, and every additional day I spend at this school my hatred just intensifies and keeps on growing. I’ve tried to keep an open mind at times and be social, but I just find myself still dreading every moment, being oddly mad or irritated at everyone, and I just keep getting this gut feeling punching me on the inside telling me to go home. 

Fortunately, my parents are okay with any decision I make, as they know how I am feeling and my future transfer plans (which I know I will work incredibly hard to make happen). At this point it’s just if I can stay for the entire semester, or if I should drop out before October 14th. I’m going to seek counseling throughout the in-between weeks, because I think for the first time in my life I’m developing some sort of mental health issues (I get moments where I want to fall off the face of Earth; right now I’m currently in a hiatus to everyone but my parents and all my social media has been turned off. I know I would never pull through with this, so don’t worry, but I find myself googling ways to kill myself because at times my emotions get so intense. But I usually think about the logistics of everything and how easily everything could be fixed by just going home, and so I’m never actually serious about these thoughts. I just don’t know why I get them randomly) and if I’m genuinely going to give the school at least a month of trying, I need to be in the right mental state. But from where I stand right now, I want to go home now more than ever and I genuinely don’t think I can last the entire semester and I don’t think anything will change, as stubborn as I sound :/ It’s just not a fit for me, and I don’t think I need advice on how I can force it to be a fit, because I’ve heard it all already, I just think I need reassurance on if it’s okay to drop out mid-semester and follow through with my transfer to a UC plans. I’d be missing this entire semester of school if I do decide to drop, but I’d work full-time in the meantime, think about what I want to major in, &amp; go back to community in the spring. I have about 10 AP credits that I know can be used towards my transfer credits too, so I would just use those and take summer classes to stay on track with my missed semester. The only con about going home this early is that everyone would think I’m a disappointment, failure, someone who couldn’t even last four months and gave-up, etc. and I have so many little cousins who have looked up to my academic record that it’s just painful to tell them I’ve come back because I wasn’t strong enough to go to college. Idk. I just need any advice I haven’t heard yet at this point.

I had abusive neglectful parents who had no involvement in my life and so I basically didn’t pay attention/go to school up until my junior year of High School when I snapped into reality and realized Ive wasted so much time. By then it felt like it was too late to catch up. I dropped out and by some miracle passed my GED without any points to spare.

I feel like I never developed the habits that are essential for success in schooling. I don’t know how to study. I don’t know how to focus. I don’t know how to memorize things. I don’t know how to keep a consistent schedule. I don’t know how to stay organized. I don’t know how to prioritize work. I don’t know how to not get overwhelmed. I don’t know how to work with others. I don’t know how to ask for help, I’m on like a 4th grade math level (I literally have no clue how I passed the math portion of the GED. If I had missed one more point I would have had to retake it.), my English and grammar skills, have deteriorated, etc.

After I got my GED I tried and failed 4-5 different semesters in college. I felt stunted. I wasn’t able to keep up with everybody else. And my embarrassment and lack of confidence instigated my depression and anxiety and would always end up with me taking a leave of absence or quitting half way through and getting horrible grades across the board. I’d asked the accessibilities dept for help, but that mostly resulted in me being able to sign up for classes when the seniors do, because I was having a hard time getting good classes with teachers able to help struggling students.

I know I’m better than this. I know I can do school. It’s just hard because I’m having to make up 12 years of education and habit building in one semester of college.

I got Cs &amp; Bs in my other classes which was disappointing but I could make it work. Next semester I took animal science, organic chem, calc 2, a literature class and a research seminar.

575,Default_Swap,1534037492,/r/college/comments/96lnf0/rantconfessionstorytime_my_poor_educational/,"I had a huge write-up for this post but I shortened it. 

In short, I am having depressed feelings and strong regrets about how I handled my education. 

High school: I did not try hard enough in high school, i.e. I did not take honor/AP classes when I was fully capable. Instead I did the bare minimum and graduated with a 3.4-5.  I should have been more social. I should not have continuously tried being on the soccer team despite being cut every year. I should have tried track since I believe I could have done really well. I never researched for the sake of my future.

I went to community college. My reasoning is that I will save my parents on tuition money. Did not realize I could get decreased tuition or even study OOS based on academics (shocking I know). I just saw the in state and OOS tuition rates and believed they were set in stone. I saw my high school friends and acquaintances living the college experience while stuck at community college. I did not get to meet and bond with thousands of people my age. 

Transferred to a relatively OK four-year university, definitely not a state flagship. I cannot explain the reasoning why but I transferred to a commuter school. Same thing as community college, I have been going to classes and then driving 30 minutes home to mommy and daddy or hanging out with two pretty good friends from community college that made their way to my current school. 

I am currently 22, almost 23, and I have 24 credits left (with a pretty good GPA, 3.41) until I complete my finance degree.  I wasted time these past years by being a hermit at home being unproductive. Out of desperation and trying to make up for lost time, I applied to two solid schools this past spring and have been accepted. I do not think it's right to go since I would waste my parent's money on lost credits and the additional time required for the degree all for a chance to get the experiences I desire. I have an orientation I am supposed to be at this Thursday which is a four-hour drive to determine how many of my transferred credits (78) will actually apply to the finance degree. I do not know if I should go. 

My confession is that I want those social bonds, parties, and no surprise, hookups. I am very envious of when I see what I missed out on especially what's on social media. I know people’s best moments are on social media but it shows they are doing something fun with friends and meeting new people. I haven’t had a girlfriend or a hookup during my entire college life. I wouldn’t call myself bad looking or awkward/anti-social either just I haven't been given many opportunities.  I went to the beach yesterday for the first time in a longtime and seeing these pretty college girls walking around got me in my feelings.  

I know I am in a difficult situation but any advice would be appreciated. It seems like I will just have to bite my tongue and keep that void within me. Also, a little worried I won’t find someone.

I just finished my first year of college at a large public state school. I received a full ride based on academics and financial need. I lived in the area for about 10 years growing up, so I thought I’d love it.

However, I didn’t. I felt like a small fish in a big pond, and even though the university is ~40,000 people, it seems like lots of kids just hung out in groups from their various high schools. I’m very quiet and don’t party, so I had a hard time making friends. I tried a few clubs, but none seemed to fit for me. My dad lives 40 minutes away from the campus and I went home on the weekends (I lived in the dorms), but we have a strained relationship and I felt unhappy both at home and school. I did very well academically (3.9 gpa) but it wasn’t the great college experience I was expecting.

I came home for the summer, as I live 8 hours away with my mom and brother and didn’t see them much during the school year. I was extremely homesick and was struggling with some mental health issues (longstanding depression and anorexia, mainly), so I decided to apply for a transfer to the local public state school in my hometown, not really believing anything would come of it.

Well, to my surprise, I received a full ride to this school too. While it isn’t as well known as school A, school B is smaller and obviously as close to my mom and brother as I can get. They are both unranked, though, and i plan to go to law school, so it doesn’t really matter either way. So now, I’m stuck.

So, in summary:

School A is larger with more name recognition in my state, but not on a large level. I would receive a $4500 refund per semester if I commuted from my dad’s home, which I’m not sure if i want to do. I like the general area of School A better than school B, but I’m lonely and have struggled mentally being away from home and around a toxic parent who doesn’t believe in mental illness and thinks religion will cure all (that’s a long story). School A is also more familiar, as I’ve been there a year, and I have enough credits to graduate 3 semesters early with a double major.

School B is smaller, more personal, and close to my mom and brother, who I am very close to and miss a lot. I would receive about $3000 back a semester, but would save money on gas because it’s about a 10 minute drive. School B is not very well known outside of the city it’s in. My mental health is better here, as my mom is my main support system. I would be unfamiliar with this school, but also have friends I know from high school. I could double major and graduate 2 semesters early. I just don’t want to regret transferring and doing what lots of kids do in my city - go off for a year and then come back and live here for the rest of their life.

I know this is a personal decision, but I just needed some outside opinions. I know I’m lucky to have two full rides and to be able to make this decision, but it’s a hard one. I really appreciate any input or help!

I'm used to getting good grades and things coming to me easily, and computer science didn't. That was the first and only class that I've failed in college.

I had a cushion to fall back on and there were practically no penalties for me failing classes as long as I kept my GPA above a certain number.

581,JereBear_2281,1531151641,/r/college/comments/8xcy1m/any_advice_on_my_situation/,"Hello everyone,

Not sure this is the right place for this but I'm going to try.

I need some help, and it's a long story but I'll keep it as short as possible. 

I just finished my freshman year of college, and now I'm worried that I won't have enough financial aid to ride out until the end of my education. I come from a family that is very mixed in it's financial status, as in my father was making absolute bank until he lost his job in 2009 due to mass layoffs which effectively ruined my parents lives, but he's also in consideration for a job that'll pay around $85,000 a year, so that would put them, and possibly by extension me, in a very good financial situation. But I've learned that when planning things it's always best to prepare for the worst, so let's just forget I mentioned that potential new job lol 

Anyways, the college I attended for the 2017 - 2018 school year cost roughly $22,000 a year with room and board, which is a necessity as it's a three hour drive from where I live. So, considering that my degree would require me to attend for five years, that'll roughly be a grand total of $110,000, and I just found out that an undergrad, who is still a dependent, can only take out up to$39,000 in government student loans. About $11,000 of that was used this past year, with grants/free aid covering the rest besides another $5000 that slipped through the cracks, which my parents ended up covering by taking out a loan that they can't afford. So that leaves me with a maximum of $28,000 in government loans and whatever grants and other free aid I get offered to cover $88,000 of college tuition. Now, looking back at how my financial aid for 2017 - 2018 worked out, and considering that my EFC went up a ton just because my sister moved out, my Higher Education award, which everyone gets, has dropped from $5000 to a little over $2000, things aren't looking very good there. Oh, and there's also the issue of your student loan eligibility decreasing every year that you're in school(I haven't fact checked that myself, buy I remember a financial advisor telling me that). 

Also, I've also been an average to slightly below average student when it comes to subjects that aren't within my interest, no matter how hard I work. All the way from 1st grade to my freshman year of college, if it wasn't related to music, art, writing or history, I would suck at it. This left me with a rather mediocre high school GPA, and things only improved slightly during my first year of college. So because of this, my odds of getting scholarships are slim to none, not to say that's kept me from applying, though. Oh, and because I'm a white male from an all white family, it seems like the entire college system assumes that I don't need any help and that I'm already at a much higher advantage than everyone else. Lol. 

So in terms of financial aid, things look pretty damn grim. There's also the option of using as much financial aid as I possibly can, and then applying for private loans, but there's no guarantee I would even get approved for them, and that would leave me at an absoluye, best situation, bare minimum of $50,000 in total debt, if I'm the luckiest person in the world. In reality it'd probably end up being closer to $110,000, maybe around $80,000. And I'm not sure that I want to take on all of that for a career that could write possibly pay sub-$30,000 a year starting out in a seemingly dying field. 

Which segways me into informing you that my current degree path is for a Music Education degree, which I would use to become a high school band director. As far as I'm aware, the only true passion I've ever had was for high school marching band, and to a lesser extent concert band. I never really had any other activities or groups where I felt like I belonged. I tried a couple different sports and a few different clubs, but none of them resonated with me. But I loved marching band and I excelled there, having earned the highest ranks in student leadership within the program. Marching band gave me the same competitiveness factor that you could get from sports, taught me valuable lessons, and gave me an overall sense of purpose. That's why I want to become a high school band director; so I can keep doing what I love while also helping new young people find a passion for it.

Now that all sounds fine and dandy, but when you realize that a high school band director will probably make scraps starting out, sometimes even less than other new educators, and the fact that school systems have been cutting music programs from public school curriculum for a while now, and are still doing so, it starts to seem like a much less viable and worthy option to out $80,000 worth if debt towards, even if it is my passion. There's also the fact that my main drive for this is for the love of the music meets competition aspect, and I'm not sure if someone who is only in it for the competitiveness should be teaching students. 

Although this is my only passion that I've discovered, I'm aware that it's not my only option. Hell, I never even considered that a life-long career. My plan was to ride that out until I was 50 or so and then start my own instrument sales and music lesson business. So keeping that in mind, I've also been toying around with the idea of going to a more local college that I can drive to everyday and pursuing a business management degree with a minor in music. Other interests and skills that I'm not sure what to do with are good-great writing skills, pretty okay visual art skills(mainly drawing), and being totally okay with doing hard work with my hands, getting dirty, and just doing ""tough guy"" work in general. I've also always enjoyed creating things and using my imagination. 

So what do I do? Do I follow my only real passion and try to attain that, even though I know I could be cut short and ruined financially before even attaining my goals? Or should I look for something else that I can pursue that matches my other skills and interests? I just feel so lost and confused right now.

Thanks for any help! 

Edit: Should probably mention that less than 10 colleges in my state offer Music Ed, and they're all at least two hours away, and none of my family leaves near any of them.

I feel so ashamed and disappointed in myself. I started off rough in all of my classes this quarter, and I tried so hard to bring up my grades to an A, but no matter how hard I tried this quarter, things were only slightly improving, but not enough to bring me up to an A. 

I know this may sound crazy, but I’ve been crying almost everyday about this. I truly feel like giving up. I feel so stupid that I couldn’t get all A’s this quarter. I don’t know what to do with my self. Finals are next week, I don’t see what the point is in studying for them anymore since I can’t get an A in my classes.

I really need help. I know I shouldn’t be feeling so shitty like this, but I can’t help it. I’ve worked so hard this quarter and I still wasn’t good enough. Even my parents were telling me that they were proud of me that I did my best. But I still feel that my best wasn’t good enough. I feel like a failure. I’m a premed student and I know how Bs can get you rejected from med school.

I put a lot of my worth into my grades and I wish I can stop doing this to myself because I’m never proud of what I do. Has anyone else ever felt this way? How do you overcome these feelings and move on? I want to do better next quarter, but now that I know these Bs are gonna be on my transcript, I don’t have any motivation to do well anymore.

As I’ve seen others mention, I never had to try too hard in high school to get good grades so college hit me pretty hard and I really need to work on my work ethic for school. That being said, I think my gpa is salvageable and that’s not so much what this post is about. What I wanted to share is that despite my disappointment with how I did in school, I had a really great year. I tried so many new things and met so many new people and I felt really happy, happier than ever.

I’ve had ongoing family problems and health related issues and plenty of mishaps along the way but for once, these things seem manageable. Sometimes I even feel guilty for not feeling worse about some of the family stuff. It’s like something has totally shifted.

So I want to my safety school (also a UC but I don't want to name it because there are people who like it). It's been a year in, and I still don't enjoy it here. People including friends and relatives ask me how college is and I want to say I hate it, but I lie. Should I keep lying? I don't have any good friends, most people leave on weekends, transfers weren't allowed to dorm and need to get off campus apartments, and it's overall dull. I transferred from a CA community college so I can't really transfer again. I actually tried but was told I could not transfer to another UC. So I applied to USC (it's not a UC) earlier this year and got accepted for this Fall, I was happy that I got in, but due to the cost of tuition, no/low financial aid, and 1\-year delay in graduation due to nontransferable classes, and the fact that transfers can't dorm there either, I decided that it won't be logical.

I'm so jealous that most of my friends went to my top school and they all love it and have made so many new friends in their dorm halls. I visit sometimes, and I just feel so bad that I can't go there.

Some of it is my major's fault, computer science. All my friends study easier majors like political science and sociology. That's probably why I didn't get in. The classes here aren't too hard though they probably would have been if I want there, that's the only positive I think of. I don't like the students in my classes. They are so antisocial. I like computers as a subject, but I dislike the CS culture so much. So there's that too.

The vibes of the school I'm in just makes me sad. I pretend like I'm not. I try to trick myself into thinking I like it here. I think after I graduate in 1.5 years I'll be sad that I didn't get the college experience that I wanted. I act like I'm happy and I try to be open. Even though I don't have friends, I try to do things alone that I want to do like go to the beach or go to a park or something. No one else but my parents would think I don't like it here because I do a good job at pretending, but at the end of the day, I feel depressed here. I don't know what to do. 

I guess there isn't much I can do. Just wanted to get some feedback/advice since I never tell people this.

TLDR: I have been going to my safety school for the past year and I dislike it. I wish I was at my dream school with my friends. I don't like my antisocial CS classes.

This fall of 2018 will be the start of my senior year of college. I have attended every semester of school as a full time student up until this past spring semester. I took last spring semester off because I wasn't feeling motivated to register for classes. When I originally started attending this college almost 4 years ago, I was pursuing a associates degree in graphic design. Graphic design is really the only thing I am talented at so I decided why not, let's give it a try. Almost two years into the degree, I opted to switch degrees because I wasn't happy with graphic design anymore. I chose a bachelors in business administration to be my new major. Now, I am almost 2 years into this degree and I am having the same issue. I am not enjoying a single second of it. I find it hard to learn, retain information, or even stay focused in class. Every time a new semester rolls around I wait until the last minute to do anything and everything. The motivation is just not there. 

I am considering quitting, or ""dropping out"". I do not like the sound of that but it appears to be the smartest option at this point. Taking these business classes are a waste of my money and both the school's and my time. Not to mention, this whole process makes me super stressed and depressed. It consumes my thoughts and happiness and I generally find it hard to be a happy person while enrolled in classes. It is just to hard to juggle work and school for me. I have tried going down to part time and that did not work, either. 

What I think I want to do now is quit, and come back later when I find something I am passionate about. Does that sound smart? Obviously, dropping out in general is not smart. However, given my situation I think it is the best option. Has anyone been in this situation before?

588,rudypen,1525667874,/r/college/comments/8hkycg/i_think_im_depressed_or_about_to_be/,"So, the title pretty much explains it all. Not even sure why I'm making this post. I don't feel like I have good enough friends to talk to about this, which is partly what has me so down. Over the past week I've noticed a lot of things in my life I'm unhappy about:

* I'm going into my fifth and final year of school, and I see that most of my friendships have been meaningless and will not last past graduation. I used to be so extraverted and loved people, but now I don't see the point. Maintaining relationships is hard. I have a lot of shallow friendships with no roots. I go to a commuter school so it's twice as hard to meet people, and I've tried 15 different student orgs but most didn't work out. I feel like I wasted my college years. I thought you were supposed to meet your best friends in college?
* My major is alright, but I'm afraid that I keep making small compromises to do what my parents suggest and will end up unhappy and doing something I hate for the rest of my life. Unfortunately I don't have much of a choice, for reasons I will not explain right now. I'm afraid I'll never do anything worthwhile or make any difference in the world. 
* I really miss my childhood best friend. We occasionally text each other, like a few times a semester. But it took us a while to even get to that place after we had a falling\-out, and I can't tell how emotionally invested she is over text. We used to be inseparable and were basically sisters, and it's hard to believe she simply stopped caring. I'll probably never have a friend like her again.
* I'm pretty sure I'm in love with a good friend who lives in a different state 10\+ hours away. We've known each other for a year. I've dated other guys since we met, and thought I ""moved on"". I still tear up when he mentions going on dates with other girls and I want him so badly. There's no chance we'll be together and I really wish I could get over him. Like right now. What if when I'm married to someone else I'm still not over him?
* My parents don't believe in or understand mental illness. I've had ADHD and depression. They think that just because I happened to get better without much intervention that I was exaggerating/didn't really have anything. My ex seems to have undiagnosed bipolar or schizophrenia and was stalking me, but randomly stopped a week ago. Now nothing will convince my parents that these are very real illnesses. Convincing them to actually believe that these things are serious is harder than recovery, I swear.

I'm starting a job and classes this week, which is kind of good because it'll give me something to do but it might also just mask the issues I have and allow me to ignore them. It might also bring up more feelings of inadequacy. Who knows.

If you actually read through all of this, bravo. Feel free to ignore, or give me any advice or a pep talk, or simply tell me to get over it. Any outside perspective would be nice. I felt like I was getting sucked into a black hole and just needed to get it all off my chest.",college,"I think I'm depressed, or about to be",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8hkycg/i_think_im_depressed_or_about_to_be/,1525685874.0
589,johnalderton021,1525323717,/r/college/comments/8gnwos/us_cannot_go_to_college_becauseof_my_parents/,"Alright, so I have a rather difficult and extremely stressful situation I am going through right now. I wish to go to college for accounting, get my CPA, and work for the Big 4 or a mid-tier firm. I'm a money man myself; I love money, and I love learning the language of business. Hey, I even wanted to throw in another major as well, either in finance or data science (applied statistics). But, my dreams are essentially crushed for the time being because of my parents. Pardon some of the background information, but I feel like it is needed.

My parents are the epitome of the paradox of hard-working and laziness at the same time (no disrespect, just harsh honesty); they're both extremely intelligent individuals with college educations, but they choose to work menial jobs that a high school dropout could probably do. Together, they make around 60k a year. Doesn't seem too bad right? But no, they are spenders...very big spenders. Because of this, they literally saved $0 for my college. Not to mention, they will also refuse to do the FAFSA. I've tried numerous times to convince them, but to no avail, they are firm in their stance. My parents kept telling me that they would help pay for my college, but during my senior year of high school, they suddenly throw at me that they won't be doing it anymore. As a senior, this was a major shock to me because they changed their story 180 degrees. My father told me: ""If you want to go to college, you are going to have to pay for everything. We won't help you."" Another thing that is quite annoying is how my parents are also religious fanatics. They're extremely devout Christians who basically became extremely salty towards me all because I decided that I didn't want to do religious classes anymore. For example, just because I decided to stop doing religious classes, my father did not let me drive my own car anymore (for almost a year) as well as f***ing up my checking account (a lotta money that would have paid for 2 year of community college was ""gone""). Luckily now, I opened up a new checking account at PSECU (PA Credit Union) without any chance of my father screwing up my finances. That along with what I mentioned previous have left me incredibly disillusioned as well as hopeless.

So I applied to four local colleges, knowing my situation will require me to commute, not live on campus. I applied to Elizabethtown, Lebanon Valley, Penn State Harrisburg and HACC (Harrisburg Area Community College). I tried explaining everything to the financial aid officers, but of course, since a college education in America has nothing to do with smarts but all about how much money you can wipe your ass with, they didn't do much to help at all. Even telling them that the FAFSA was not going to be completed, they still did nothing to help me. Yes, even the community college is too expensive for me (parents won't cosign any loans).

So, I have a plan; if my parents aren't going to do much to help me pay for college, I guess I'm going to have to pick up the tab right? I plan to take a gap year or two, working a full time job as a bookkeeper as well as a part time job somewhere else (that is assuming I will get the bookkeeping job). I'm going to work to my fullest capacity as well as not spending a single cent from that checking account. Also, I will be retaking the ACT and will be aiming for a really high score (32-36 range). I didn't really know about the possibilities of financial aid through standardized tests until much too late, but better late than never right? My current SAT and ACT scores are 1220 and 27 respectively.

So, is a gap year or two (working a full time job as a bookkeeper and a part time somewhere else, as well as working my butt off to get a 32 or higher on the ACT) a good idea? I really see no other alternative other than the military at this point. But that's probably not an option either because I do have chronic asthma.

So please, after my giant block text of bleh, I was wondering if any of you could please give me some financial advice. I want to go to college and I know what I want to do, but the only thing that is blocking my way is money. Do you think my plan sounds good, or do you have other things in mind? Again, the crux of my plan is assuming I get the bookkeeping job, which pays 28k a year. I really hope to read your responses because as of right now, I am at the crossroads...and am completely and utterly lost. I feel physically and mentally drained from thinking about all of this...its extremely painful to me. I know I'm smart, but colleges don't really give a damn about that; all they care about is my check to them for ten-twenty f'ing grand!

Side-Note:Plus, if I am taking this gap year to garner money and improve my test scores, do you think I'd have a chance at Wharton? My GPA is a 4.0 and I have around 10 AP classes up my belt (some of which include Calculus BC and Physics 1&amp;2). Sometimes I see the high life of people in Ivy Leagues and feel depressed. I see all the smiles, the laughs, the proms, the handsome, clean-shaven and slick-haired white guys with their immaculate Asian girlfriends, and I think to myself: some people really can wipe their ass with their money can't they?

At the time of writing this it is 11:57pm on the night before decision have to be made and I’m practically stuck going to a college I really don’t like. So I went through the college process as normal however I made the mistake of applying to way too many safety’s and way to to many reaches and not enough target schools. Of the safety schools, I forced to apply to UMaine Orono by my mom despite my disliking . Well acceptance letters time came around and unsurprisingly I get waitlisted/ rejected from all the reaches, got into my safety’s , and got into the couple targets applied to. I narrowed down my list to about three colleges, Wentworth, Florida Tech, and UMaine, (two targets, one safety, didn’t consider anymore safety’s because they were expensive and not good schools) Umaine ended up in that group because it was so cheap and as backup. Eventually i visited Wentworth, and I’m a small school/city type person so of course I liked it a lot as well as I enjoyed the program, I’m also from Boston so being in the middle of the city was a big +. When I went to visit UMaine, I absolutely hated it. The campus felt so isolated being all the way up north, I didn’t really enjoy the type of people who go there (mostly but not all party kids, I don’t really mix in with that crowd) and I was less than impressed with their engineering program (I would be going for mechanical, and that’s the branch that had the worst facilities as well as of the only engineerings that weren’t guaranteed Co-op/rarely got it)(also most of their job placement is in northern Maine, and I don’t think I would be able to mentally handle living up there for more than a week). I eventually had to rule out Florida tech as I did not have time to visit/too expensive to fly down. Fast forward a little bit later when Financial aid packets start to role in. Wentworth is almost twice as expensive as Maine and they gave me little no aid. I tried appealing for more aid but they gave only $2000. This made the Wentworth net cost $39,000, making it almost half of my parents income and 11,000 more that Maine (which is 28,000 a year). On top of that with my brother currently in college, we would have to $5000 a month, which is insane. So in the end, I am stuck with these two options: Go to an overpriced college that I enjoy(but can barely afford), or a cheap college that I hate. Wentworth pros: nice facilities, good campus, strong co-op, a college I like Cons: overpriced for what you get, hard to transfer if I didn’t like it. Maine Pros: cheap, easier to transfer cons: the campus, the people, the program. My biggest issue was although i liked Wentworth a lot, money just can’t be ignored as well as I don’t know if it’s worth the money (it’s a good school, not a great school). However my other biggest issue was I honestly really don’t like Maine as well as there’s no guarantee I’d be able to transfer and if I couldn’t I’d be stuck. After talking it out with my friend and siblings, although it’s a really tough one for me, I think I’m going to have to put my deposit down for Maine because I really don’t want to be a financial burden on my family and I’d feel really guilty if I put down for wentworth (although my parents keep telling me it’s still an option). It just seems like the most logical course of action even though it doesn’t really help me personally and any way. I know at the end of the day it’s just college and it sounds like I’m being dramatic. but it’s really taking a toll on me emotionally for some reason. I can’t help but start crying whenever I think about my fait (and Im not normally the emotional type). Anyone experience anything similar? Is my decision the right one? Any coping advice for now/the future? 

TL;DR-I was forced to apply a college that I wasn’t interested in (Umaine). Got in, visited it, hated it. Fast forward and I’m stuck between deciding to go to an Overpriced college I like a lot but would barely be able to afford (wentworth) or going to a cheap college that I honestly really dislike (Umaine). Because I didn’t want to be a severe financial burden, I am choosing Umaine, but it’s really taking a toll on me mentally/emotionally for some reason and I don’t know how to cope with it. 

Anyone experience anything similar? Is my decision the right one? Any coping advice for now/the future?

I want to be a teacher and wish to maybe go to grad school or some teaching program, but my GPA when I graduated was a 2.8. Also because of my depression and other mental health issues going untreated for a while, things didn’t get better for me so the bad GPA persisted throughout all my seven semesters of college, which means I can’t say “at least I improved” as a reason.

I graduated from a prestigious university in a STEM field and I understand that I have privilege in that aspect. But anytime I voice any problems, a lot of people say that my worries are unwarranted because of my school and major; yet here I am, still worried. I haven’t been able to find any internships as an undergrad because of my GPA and have actually been called stupid and lazy before which was discouraging to say the least. Extracurriculars have mostly been based on music ensemble and the non-English language I’m fluent in, but nothing academic. I’ve always felt so incompetent and so frustrated with myself during my undergrad. Since I’ve graduated a semester early, I’ve been using my “eighth semester” to take a break and have tried to get my mental health and my life under control.

But now my anxiety has sky rocketed once again. I am planning to talk to a professor from a state school regarding a post-baccalaureate program for teaching (she seemed interested thanks to my big name university), but I’m so scared about her seeing my GPA and telling me that I’m too stupid to teach. Should I just choose a different career path? Have I screwed up my prospects? It’s gotten to the point that I can’t sleep and the bad feelings I’ve had back in college are rushing back. I am terrified that I’m going to go back being the way I was. I don’t want to feel that way again.

I don’t know what to do and I just needed to express this somewhere. I feel like I’ve let everyone down, especially my family who’ve worked so hard to come to the United States for our future and the teachers who have inspired me to want to go into teaching. I know that no one can really help me because what’s done is done. I just needed to vent because I feel myself going crazy with anxiety that it’s blinding me from thinking straight.

He goes to the local coffee shop after school every day to study until they close around 8 or 9. He stays up all night trying to get his work done and studying for tests.


He's incredibly smart but he really struggles with AP chemistry and econ. He says he's tried going to student services for help but most of them are judgemental and cruel. (I've experienced this firsthand as I went to the same school he's attending now.)


He's having a lot of issues with our mom and the amount of pressure she puts on him. It's gotten to the point where all they do is argue because she doesn't think he's doing enough.


He got the warning letter in the mail after he started getting a couple of B's, but in two of his classes he now has C's. He is trying his absolute hardest and it's hard to watch him stress about it so much. Does anyone have any experience with this sort of thing or any idea what he could do?

I didnt really know what I wanted to do after HS. I was a good student, kept a solid 3.2 GPA each year, did all my homework, did band, went to a  few parties, but overall a normal kid. Then during senior year I decided to lay out a plan that I found would best suit me. Go to my local CC, see what I like and decide, work part time, after that, go to University. Pretty much the basic plan I assume many kids have. But no. Instead my family were so proud and happy that I got accepted into Univeristy on full ride, they wanted me to go there. I didnt want to go to a big college, I wanted to start off small. But no, my parents didnt want that, they wanted me to experience the college life, even though I argued that I wanted to go with my plan. My dad said ""Well it's not your decision to make"", well fuck me I guess. My mom, on multiple occasions, said ""Its not what you want, it's what your father wants"", or ""I dont understand why you dont just listen to me. I said you're going so you're going why you gotta be so difficult"". Fast forward into my first semester, I tried my best to like it. I threw on a smile, chatted with people, only to find out that no one is your friend. I had like 4 group projects, and they would add my number, as me ok fb, Instagram, snapchat, steam, discord, all those. But since I couldn't do a good enough job, aka ME DOING ALL THE SHIT AND ITS NOT TO THEIR LIKING, they removed me from all those. This is gonna sound real dumb of me, but I failed Precalc that semester, honestly I really didnt give a fuck. I failed my engineering intro class, lost all my scholarships and grants, and wanted to leave after that. But my parents convinced me to stay. Nest semester I fail precalc again, so now I'm held back in all my classes. Next semester I pass, move onto calc. This time I fail calc cause I got a final grade of 72, you need at least a 73 or higher to pass, so fuck me. I talked to the prof and they didnt do much. Told my parents, and my mom says ""You know if you went to a CC and did ok, youd be on track to graduate"" NAW FUCKING SHIT REALLY!?!? That slipped out of my mouth and then they got mad at me for being rude and shit, well guess what, I get to be rude. My younger brother goes to CC and is graduating this year with an AS in engineering, THATS WHAT I WANTED. AND HES FUCKING MOVING ON TO UNIVERSITY. WHY, WHY, WHY? Why fucking hell is my younger brother gonna be an engineer first, and not me? Oh and here's a fucking kicker, my uncle tries to talk to me, to ease my mind, to convince to stay and work hard and shit. He said ""Your parents are paying this money for you to go to a good school cause they love you"" by that rationale they must've fucking hated my little brother and let him go to a community college. Fucking hell I just cant any more. I cant deal with working hard and failing. I are staying up till 2am doing problem sets. Literally either I'm fucking retarded or this shit's hard. And before anyone says ""are you just cram studying"" or ""are you really studying"" yes I am. I get home at 6pm, eat, go to the gym, come back at 8. Then study. I have gotten 0s on all my physics 2 quizzes, I have gotten a 22 and a 16 on my exams, and y'know what, I dont care. I'm tired, I'm sleepy, im angry, I'm jealous, I hate myself. I hate my parents. I wish I could rewind just to my senior year of hs so I could do what I want. Theres this bullshut saying I hate ""people want to go back and change the future. But wont start changing now"" or something like that. I hate now, I will continue to hate now, I will hate the future, and i would love to do back to senior year and just make that small change of acceptance.

He was blatantly whispering my name to get answers, and I was so uncomfortable and refused. He was surprised that that was my response and called me an asshole for what I did. Later on I explained where my values lay and he apologized. We were fine after that although I saw myself unconsciously distancing myself from him. I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt that maybe that incident was something to learn from and I really thought he won't do it again after that. A quarter later, my roommate tells me that he cheated again on another final. They sat next to each other, and apparently she was pulling up pictures of notes and lectures on his phone during the final. My roommate was very uncomfortable with this all especially since they were somewhat close. After that, my roommate and our housemate had a brief exchange about how the whole thing made him uncomfortable, but the next day our housemate proceeded to talk about how he will be cheating on another class final. He had two phones, and apparently he hides one of them somewhere on his body while the other one he can turn in when he asks to go to the restroom, since the TAs/professor usually ask to turn in phones when someone needs to go to the restroom. Basically, this entire thing has just made me very uncomfortable and somewhat mad. I study very hard to get to the point of success that I have now, and the fact that someone can openly cheat like that seems like a slap to the professors, other students, and the prestigious university we are all going to. And the fact that he has somewhat good enough grades to apply to a good graduate school program irks me because I know that he didn't do it in an honest way. My roommate and I talked about possibly turning him in, but we know it's difficult due to lack of evidence. At this point, I basically have lost all interest in associating with him and if I ever had the chance to go back in time, I probably would have not chosen to live with him if I knew he was like this. Basically, I am posting this to vent, and maybe also to hear about experiences other people have had of having friends/acquaintances cheating, and how they dealt with the situation. Is it too much of me to hold my integrity at such a high value to lose interest in being friends with this person?

596,bozongle,1523249591,/r/college/comments/8avydk/im_failing_all_my_classes_and_only_recently/,"This is sort of a cry for help because I have no idea how to resolve anything I've done to myself over the past few months in such a short period of time, and my future is looking to be full of despair.

For background, I'm a first-generation Indian-American student with strict Indian parents who were academic studs and went from being nothing to achieving great success in the US. 

As a result, I was brought up to be academic-oriented and they constantly reinforced me to get good grades, do well in school, join academic clubs, etc. And it worked, for the most part. High school was structured in a way where low effort yet high talent led me to succeed. I would procrastinate every assignment yet complete them just in time to get a high grade, I was an amazing test-taker and studying for an hour or two the night before a big exam could get me an A. My constant success academically in high school overshadowed the fact I had no hobbies, no interest in anything other than to be social (I'm a very sociable person and getting rejected socially throughout high school is one of the prominent reasons of my depression/anxiety) and basically did the minimum to keep up my standard of being a smart Indian kid while also partying and trying to make friends (I won't get into detail about this, but my struggle with this damaged me beyond repair). 

At the end of it all, I graduated with a 4.43 GPA, a 35 on my ACT (which was enforced by constant tutoring by a very expensive tutor which my parents probably didn't have the money to be spending on), and a myriad of school club accomplishments. Yet, I procastinated my college and scholarship essays to the point where I didn't get into any of the twelve colleges I applied nor got any scholarships except for my safety state university (they gave me a $40,000 scholarship based on my GPA) which I am studying at now.

I was (and still am) a foolish kid, and college independence was huge. No longer was I constantly harassed by my parents about academics, I was finally allowed to go out on my own whim and take contorl of my life. At first, college was a breath of fresh air, but then everything came crashing down once responsibilities overwhelmed me. Essays, exams, homework, scholarships (my parents, although middle-class, have a lot of commitments financially and thus need any financial support I can get), socializing with people, friendships, past memories of hardship, all sorts of different stresses and pressures overwhelmed me. So I did what I do best: avoid it all. I started skipping class and procrastinating HW assignments, overconfident that I was able to do it in high school all the time. After I did it a little, I got away with making up/bullshitting assignments at first. But, college is nothing like HS. High school had structure, and was enforced discipline - even if I procrastinated HW, I still was forced to sit in classes and pay attention for 8 hours a day. My life had no such discipline or structure, and as such I let everything go to shit. I started partying more and more because I had few such opportunities in high school but then found myself not enjoying any of it because of my constant anxiety about others' thoughts of me and my actions. I started withdrawing from others and just overall my life once I hit a snowball effect of just skipping class, trying to party and be accepted by various friend groups, and just having no motivation or energy to do anything at all - I literally tried to just find instant gratification in anyway possible. This led to me skipping class every week and I turned into a stoner. I convinced myself I was a lazy bastard from all the drugs and partying and after an Adderall binge before finals week, I recovered my grades just enough above the 3.0 GPA requirement for my scholarship; I got a 3.16.

Going to a safety school, my parents expected a 3.9/4.0. I felt like a complete failure and decided I would recover it next semester, and take up healthy and positive habits in order to make sure I did. By committing to this, I felt that telling my parents at the end of the year I got a 3.6/3.7 balanced out would be better than telling them the truth. So what did I do? Faked my transcript, and told them I got a 4.0, and they weren't even surprised they literally told me it was ""expected.""

Then, winter break came, and this was a very depressive period for me. I got rejected again by the people I thought were my friends (didn't invite me to any parties, didn't respond to my messages) and literally spent 21 straight days doing nothing but sleeping and playing Fortnite. I didn't even enjoy fortnite; I did it to pass the time.


This trend continued into the next semester, I took easier classes so I thought things would go easy, and I got caught up in my overconfident avoidance mindset. Long story short, I fell into a web of drug use, lying, avoiding responsibility, and trying to figure things out on my own before I finally hit the lowest point - I spent 3 weeks in a row skipping class, sleeping in until 4 PM, didn't enjoy or want to do anything, not play video games, not do drugs, or party, just stay in bed and do nothing, and finally went 48 hours straight without eating anything - because I had no energy or motivation to even get up and walk 2 minutes to the dining hall and eat. I decided it was enough, went to CAPS (Counseling and Psycholigical Services) and after breaking down and crying to my psychologist for 40 minutes about my problems and my life, he very easily diagnosed me with depression, anxiety, and also possible ADD.

This diagnosis was less than a month ago, and everything makes sense to me now. I've had depression for years but was able to cope because of the structure of my life in high school, but once that structure was gone, everything fell apart and I didn't realize that I needed help. I didn't think it was depression no matter how much I researched the issue - I want to be a psychiatrist and had helped my best friend, the one person besides my girlfriend who is closest to me, through his depression, even to the point where he was about to commit suicide and I was the one to talk him out of it. I always consider my self a lazy piece of shit, and I think I am truly - that depression is another excuse.

But, when I'm talking to my therapist, it all feels to real and his points hit me hard and genuinely I need therapy to improve. I got a job and started making progress in being productive, and felt so good about working a 65 hour work week last week and working another 38 hours this week. I work close every night, get a good 7 hours of sleep, and still have been struggling to go to class but I've been doing better. Small steps have helped me lift myself out of this depression, but the damage of my ignorant self has been done. a 3.16 GPA first semester, and now - Ds/Fs in 3 of my classes and a C- in one class with only a month of my semester left (with a bunch of missing assignments, attendance/participation points lost, exams coming up that I have no idea how to study for because they cover months of material). I feel like I have trapped myself - my parents will freak the moment they find out about my grades, let alone the depression, or loss of scholarship. I love this university and don't want to leave and do NOT want to go to community college/local college - please don't suggest this I've already considered this. I don't technically have a medical diagnosis, as the soonest psychiatric consultation in my collegetown is in the summer, and of course I'm under my parents' insurance so they would notice the bill. Everything's crashing down on me and I genuinely feel there is nothing but despair in my life coming for me - my therapist told me to reach out to an advisor/professors about my options but having no medical diagnosis, being so late in the semester, and still struggling to balance everything in my life and still having a habit of procrastination has made everything so much harder, let alone the thought of my awful grades, or losing my scholarship, or my parents going bezerk and withdrawing me and sending me to some Indian school. It sucks, because just as I finally started to understand what I needed to get out of this horrible phase of my life, the consequences of my past actions are keeping me in it.


I just don't know what to do. I just want to be able to get past this semester, improve myself over the summer, and come back better prepared mentally next semester with a scholarship and perform up to the academic standards I used to set myself to. But with no interests or passions, and pursuing a pre-med career simply because of my parents' desires (although the desire for psychology is true and valid), and my terrible academic record and loss of scholarship, I feel like I fucked myself over really hard. And this is an expression of all of that. I need help, I'm sorry if this was too long to read - I just thought details would help to understand my situation. **tl;dr:** after fucking around and trying to avoid my problems for my freshman year, I hit my lowest point and have been (nonmedically) diagnosed with depression/anxiety that was the root cause - but the damage is done and I will lose my scholarship (minimum 3.0 gpa) and end up with a sub 2.5 gpa this year, and my future is pretty bleak. I'm not suicidal but it's hard to get those thoughts with such a future in sight.

I believe I’ve done everything (but rush) in order to try to feel integrated in the community by joining clubs, sports, service orgs, etc. and have made a few good friends, but still wake up most days feeling unhappy. I am from New Jersey and as hard as I’ve tried to shake off the home sickness, I am very close with my family and the distance really kills me. I was originally choosing between UT and Temple Univwrsity in Philadelphia, both to major in graphic design. I quickly found that the program at Texas was not at all for me, and did not live up to my potential, and have recently decided to switch my major to advertising, which Texas has a great program for. However, although I am enjoying advertising courses more, I still really struggle to picture myself here for four years and even though I might rush next year to see if this helps, the big Greek life and football culture really never seemed like it was for me. Now, I have applied to possibly transfer closer to home at Temple, where I visited in high school and loved it. I would apply for graphic design rather than advertising because they have a well ranked program at their art school. I would also be able to room with a good friend from high school. However, I am afraid of leaving such a good advertising program that I have so far enjoyed at a high ranked school for a less prestigious school that is good for my original major. I’ve always known that I don’t want to go to an all art school like Pratt or RISD because I want a full college experience, which is why Temple seemed like a good balance. I’m really struggling with this decision, as I know that if a school exactly like Texas was just located closer to home and felt more familiar, I would most likely feel fine about it.

599,Xenatian,1521184031,/r/college/comments/84tlmp/need_advicehope_im_not_the_only_one/,"Hey y'all. So I'm a sophomore Mechanical Engineering major at a big college, but I'm an out of state student. Which means most of my ""friends"" from high school are back a in-state schools. I ha a rough time socially in high school due to health and because of my health, I didn't smoke or drink, and I think my friends though I would snitch on them if I as around them doing that, so I lost pretty much most of my friends my junior year. Didn't go to parties, everytime I tried to hang out, I get rejected, and all the party kids were my teammates on the baseball team. I also barely played any baseball, the thing I love as much as my family, because of my coach though I hate become weak after I was sick, and didn't think I could play anymore. Long story short, high school sucked. So I was kind of glad I went to an out of state school so I could no longer be around that cancer, started a new life. I was really excited to rush and join a fraternity to be part of the party life, make new friends, and compensate for what I missed out on in high school. At the same time, I was experiment with adding and dropping classes, and dropped a class for my major, Chemistry 1, on accident and couldn't find a time or days I could take it that semester, so I was already behind in my schedule before I even started college. I also didn't get into the fraternity I wanted a dropped, which I regret not being more open minded and just choosing one. To add insult to injury, my roommate facetimed his girlfriend every night, and went home weekends we didn't have home football games. I thought college was, or specifically my college, was going to be easy because its a school in the South, so you know, not much intelligence. I was wrong, and ended up with a 2.6 GPA. I was devastated, and sort of got a wake up call. The only good thing about that semester was my joining a club and finding a community through them. The next semester wasn't any better. My friend wanted me to rush so I could be in his fraternity, and didn't get a bid from them or any other frat, so another semester of no partying, making friends, or girls. I was jealous of all the guys having fun of the frats having fun an I couldn't have that kind of fun as well. Also no fun Spring Break plans. My GPA was a little better, only because I only had two classes to my degree plan, which I ended up having to dropping a class again, Calculus 1, meaning I was now a semester and a half behind in my second semester of college. I just had a bunch of electives to boost my GPA. By May, I was so glad to move out, but I couldn't transfer to my dream school, The University of Texas at Austin, because my GPA was too low. My summer was ok. I tried to take summer classes but that ended up not working out, so I couldn't catch up and that bummed me out so much because I couldn't imagine any of my friends already being behind by the end of their freshman year of college. I moved into an apartment this year, and even though I have friends, I didn't really consider too many of them as close enough friends to be roommates with, and those that I wanted to be my friends already had arrangements. So I had to roommate match, which they've, until recently, have been better than last year's roomate. Rushed again, assuming I was going to be in my friend's frat, because he said I would be a shoe-in, and not only did I not get a bid from them, but none of the other frats here. So another semester of no fun, no friends, and no girls, whereas freshman are getting into frat with no problems because they know people and get to live the life I wanted all 4 years of college. I, at most could, only be in a frat for 2 1/2 years, (probably going to be a 5, maybe 6 year student so maybe 3 or 4 years after all). Classes this semester were fine, but I tripped up on some tests and ended up with a 2.8 GPA by Christmas. The club I was part of started to drive me crazy, but at some point that half the classes I scheduled for this semester go toward a minor in Business Administration, so I thought that was cool, and am now pursuing that. I also realized that it would be easier for me to get an MBA at my from school that a Master in ME from Texas. So now, here I am, having signed a bid to a frat but not being able to do anything  or meet any of my brother's or pledge brothers because of the school's President cancelling then deciding to do Spring Rush, but not having decided when, and because it's halfway through the semester, I'm assuming they won't do it, so 2 years wasting my college time not being in a frat and having a small social life and group of good friends. I did make it a resolution to be more outgoing, which did work, but not to the amount that I wanted, and I haven't really studied or hungout with these people, just good friends in my class. So here we are today, after dropping another class that I need, Physics 1, after I, and everyone else bombed the test Monday, and just signed a lease at another complex without any friends to be my roommates, so doing roommate matching agin, only praying that my future roommates are close to my preference, let alone guys in my fraternity, so I already regret signing it, and not staying at my current complex  in another room or another complex because their closer closer, and a number of other reasons. I'm also upset that I keep dropping classes and wasting my parents money, as well as not progressing a my degree plan and getting closer to graduating. I'm upset that I don't or haven't had any of my friends become my roommates, I'm a pessimist and depressed because I always think that nothing will work-out for me since nothing has since my junior year of high school. I know that I'm depressed, everyone does, but I refuse to see a therapist because I know that I'm too stubborn and pessimistic to listen to their advice because I don't possible see how it'll improve my life. I don't go out to the bars on the weekends because I don't really have friends to go with. I tried going by myself a few times because of my resolution, and it's intimidating going by yourself, especially if you don't have a fake, because, for me, it's easier to talk to people, especially girls when I'm buzzed. Also bars quickly get expensive, are loud, and without being in a frat, I can't drink, so I stay in on the weekends, which upsets my parents. They want me to be more social. I know my priorities are out of whack, and I wish I could change that, but the party scene is so big at my school, that it's hard to not think about it. I could motivate myself with the money from my future career, which ironically, I know what to do, Reservoir Engineer, but it hasn't. I also want to get into McCombs School of Business at Texas to ge my MBA so it makes it easier to go up my future company's chain of command, which is hopefully Shell, ExxonMobil, or other big name oil companies, but for those companies I need at least a 3.2 GPA, and to get into McCombs, a 3.4. I'm also afraid about life after graduating because it seems so monogamous, waking up, go to work, go home, eat, sleep. I've heard that the social party life gets better after college because now you have money to do what I want, but I find that hard to believe because I'm no longer around college girls, and there aren't frat parties to go to anymore, only bars, an even that, to me, starts to look monogamous. That my pessimism showing again. I've heard to slowly become an optimist, I should write down at least 3 good things that happened everyday, but I can't even think of three things.I just want to hear what yall have to say, but typically when I post stuff, I get negative comment from people which is extremely unhelpful, so just advice or, hopeful stories that hopefully I'm not the only one facing these struggles.

Edit:Most of my friends are in Greek Life, and seeing everything that they're doing on Snapchat and Instagram makes me feel bad because I know that also should be me, but it isn't me, and it gets me really sad that I'm not spending my time in college like that. Another thing I worry/get upset about is that freshman, who are taking Calculus 2, Chemistry 2, and Physics 1, are making these classes look easy, or aren't struggling nearly as hard as I am in classes that I'm currently in, and it urks me how they get it and get better grades, and I don't. Another thing is for most engineering students, it takes 5 years on average to graduate, but I feel like it'll take me 5 1/2-6 years to graduate, whereas my other friends, college or high school friends, even those who are also engineering majors, will have already graduated and have a job, while I'll still be in school, making me feel like an idiot compared to them. Now I've heard you shouldn't worry about what others are doing or thinking about you, only worry about you and yourself, but for me, its a lot easier said than done because I want to impress and outdo other

I want to study aerospace but to do that i needed to pass the prerequisites and have a 3.0 gpa.  i passed the first two, but didn't do well enough in physics to get a b- in the class.  after my first semester into my second semester, my group of friends and i started rushing fraternities together.  I got a bid at a frat but didn't take it.  over time, i started noticing that i was being ostracized by them (ditching me, going out without me, calling me names).  for some reason part of me tried to save my friendship with them but i eventually got ""butted out"" by the ring leader.  during my third semester there everything went downhill for me.  i stopped going out with people, i started playing a lot of video games (10+ hours a day), and smoking a lot of weed. I'm normally a very social person who loves to make new friends but once i was isolated i just started digging a hole.  the worst was the panic attacks that would kick in anytime i was in a crowded place (I never had any panic attacks in high school.  i used to love going to concerts/festivals with friends during the summer with no issues).  i eventually ended up getting a C in linear algebra and a D- in physics (final was worth 40% of the class grade and I got a 38/100).  I currently am taking a semester off because i didn't want to retake my physics class that i failed last semester.  If i went back this semester, it would cost alot of out of state tuition to take one class (finished all other gen-ed's and can't take engineering classes until i'm in the college of engineering.

So yeah, part of me wants to go back in the fall, try to say fuck those guys and make new friends, but some other part of me wants to go back and try to be with them (I should note that the guys in the friend group aren't actually bad people, but the leader and I were never true friends.  we never publicly displayed disdain for each other but we both knew we never got along). 

I know this sounds like a long rant but i'm lost.  I currently work as a host back home in the midwest.  my parents offered to get me a physics tutor and take it at a community college to transfer the credits over and try to push my gpa over 3.0.  my mom also wants me to do coding bootcamp during this semester off as well.  The thing that also gets me is how my parents unintentionally remind me of how unmotivated i am compared to when i was in highschool.  some part of me wants to say college isn't for me and some other part also wants to fight back and say ""stop being a bitch, go back, grind hard and try"", but i am frightened of going down the same rabbit hole as i did last semester.

If it makes any difference, I spoke to a psychiatrist a while ago and am now prescribed on 10mg vyvanse and 300mg of bupropion.

601,underwaterwildfire,1518144616,/r/college/comments/7wafgi/overspending_in_college_help/,"Hello friends,
I'm 19 and a sophomore in college. As of right now, I have a terrible problem with overspending. I worked hard over the summer and winter break only to piss away the majority of my savings in college. Now, I'm starting at Square One with just about $300 to live off of. I was just recently employed at a cafe last week, but they haven't contacted me yet about getting on the schedule. I've realized that in my spending, I have two HUGE problems.

1. The majority of the money I spend comes from food. I was never taught to cook, and in all honesty, I find it boring and frustrating because I can never cook anything right. I know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about cooking. I can make a sandwich, and an omelette and that's it. I would love to meal prep/budget/buy groceries, but I find the entire cooking process overwhelming and I have no idea where I would even start. 

I have tried various youtube videos, but I always stop halfway through because a lot of times they'll say you need a certain type of equipment...I don't even know what the hell that piece of equipment is or does. 

2. I've gained about 20 pounds because of daily 7/11 runs to buy Milanos, Goldfish, and crackers. In all honesty, that's been my diet for the past month. I realize that this is absolutely horrible, but I don't know how/where I would even start to lose weight because I also don't know anything about planning at all. 

Growing up, everything was done for me. My dad is just one of those people who would rather do it himself then rely on other people. School always came easy to me, so I never had to study. Breakfast was always made for me. Laundry was always done. I am incredibly fortunate in that I kind of just skated through life thus far and got by. 

Anyways, I need some help. Does anyone know anywhere I can turn that will explain budgeting, money management, cooking, meal planning for absolute BEGINNERS? Something that would provide basic, baby steps and allow me to learn how to live by myself? 

Thanks so much, any advice is appreciated. 

EDIT: Wow! Already a ton of posts in just 30 min. Thanks guys! :)

The community colleges here are not very good at knowing what you need for what degree programs when you are in a transfer program. I have been working towards transferring for a business degree, and then I found out not only did I need Pre Calc Algebra, but also Pre Calc Trig AND Calculus 1, AND business Stats. In high school I passed algebra 1, almost failed geometry (my exam seriously saved my grade), failed algebra 2 by 2 points and had to take summer class, and then I took discrete math because I was so over it all. I’ve never been great at math because it’s all a bunch of letters and numbers to me - I have taken financial accounting and managerial accounting without too many issues because I understand the application of the numbers. I took pre Calc last semester, failed. But I had tried taking it totally online, and after making a 51 on the midterm I was basically like fuck this, I need to take it in person. I am now in that class in person with a pretty good teacher, but I feel myself already slipping. It’s always stuff like fractions that gets me. I give myself incredibly horrible text anxiety because I am not confident in myself, even if I probably know the material. I took a whole semester of remedial math last spring to prep for this (I will be 26 in May so I was 24 at that point...about 7 years out from my last algebra class). I have notes I wrote from the book myself, and then an entirely different set that I take in class from his lectures. The whole prospect of Trig freaks me out because I honestly don’t have a clue what that even entails. I’m worried that as hard as I have to work just to pass pre Calc Algebra, that I am really just stupid for thinking I can possibly pass calculus. 

The biggest thing working against me is what I told my psychiatrist today, that I feel like I have a gun to my head and the gun is my own pressure to pass. I’m really hung up on getting a business degree because I want to go into banking in general. She tried to tell me that I could always go for a communications degree or even psychology (ew) but I don’t believe they will get me where I want to be. I’m currently looking into a couple of degree programs that don’t require the calculus, which are communications with a minor in business, business admin and law, and I am inquiring on a public admin degree that has a finance admin track. 

I need someone to tell me that there is a chance I could pull this off. I’m still taking the pre Calc regardless of anything cause I a) want that F off my gpa and b) need a math core anyway. I’m giving myself this class to see how I do but if I barely make it by the skin of my teeth, or fail entirely, I will have no choice but to look into a different program. It just makes me incredibly depressed to think that something I am enjoying and can see myself being good at is being ruined by math I will almost definitely never use again in my life.

603,microssrunner17,1516340555,/r/college/comments/7rg8uz/how_to_make_more_friends_second_semester/,"This might belong in a relationships or friendships subreddit, but it's college-specific so that's why I'm posting it here. Also, sorry if this is long and has spelling mistakes, i'm on mobile.

I'm a second semester freshman attending a very large university. I opted to be a part of a program within the university that creates a smaller liberal arts environment within a big school because I thought it would make it a lot easier to make friends since I'd be living and going to class with a lot of the same people, but alas, it hasn't lived up to my expectations. 

So far this year, I've made about 4 friends in my program. Don't get me wrong, they're all great and i'm so glad i'm friends with them, but the problem is that we're all introverts that stuck together at the beginning of the year, and now we're all wishing we would've branched out more at the beginning. We all really like each other, it's just sometimes we get bored of each other, ya know? None of us have any other friends so we're always hanging out with just each other all the time and sometimes I wish I had a lot more diversity of people i could hang out with. 

the problem is, my program is kind of clique-y. Everybody is super nice, but everyone sticks to their established friend groups, and I feel really intimidated to try and break into a new friend group to make more friends. The pressure is also on because i'm a girl and i feel like girls are a lot more closed-off when it comes to adding new members to an established group because even if you're friends with one girl in the group, you also have to vibe well with all the other ones in the group. 

There's this girl in my program who seems really cool and has pretty nice friends, and it'd be nice to get into their group, but I just don't know how. I was very shy in HS, so friend-making has never come easy to me. 

I think i might ask her to study for class together, but how do you build a relationship with someone from just being the occasional study buddy to being legit friends? I don't want her to catch on that I'm desperate to be her friend, because that'll turn her off. But how do I get to the point of maybe trying to get her to invite me to dinner with her friends, or invite me and my friends to go with her to a party and stuff? I don't wanna be like, ""oh hey are you going to any parties this weekend?"" because I don't want to seem like i'm inviting myself or being too pushy or coming on too strong. She's also with her friends at all meals so she'd probably reject me if I tried inviting her to dinner or something. Plus, none of her friends know who i am because i've never had any chances to interact with them. I feel like since she already has an established group of girls that she's bff's with, it'll be hard to break in to the group because she might just only ever see me as a classmate and never invite me to anything, which sucks to think is a possibility. But i'm still gonna try!

TL;DR: Its second semester of freshman year and I want more friends, and need advice on how to make new friends and break into pre-established friend groups.

I am currently in Oklahoma City, OK and am trying to figure out what school I wanna attend as well as trying to figure out what I should be looking for in a college.

I would like to take 3 classes in the fall semester and currently have 23 credit hours in a community college in my home state, as well as a bunch of credit hours from my technical training they are supposed to go towards my Community College of the Air Force degree, but they may not transfer I really don't know.

From my time in community college I was not a great student and only have a 2.0 GPA, that may not transfer to any of the colleges that I wanna attend so I was wondering what I could do about that?

Although, I do have a 24 on my ACT and had a 3.5ish GPA in high school, my college GPA was due to laziness and lack of care. I am also getting prepared to CLEP some classes because the Air Force will pay for me to CLEP any classes I want towards my degree, I was wondering if that will affect my GPA any?
And also what schools should I be looking at if I'm wanting to major in either Computer Science or Computer Engineering? Probably an Engineering degree of some sort. 

I honestly have no idea where to begin to look in on this process because I've never really looked at any colleges before so i don't really know what to do or where to start looking for info.

607,ashwinr136,1513913461,/r/college/comments/7les1t/is_this_the_right_move/,"Hey everyone, I just finished up my first semester at the school I'm currently attending, let's call it School A. School A is a top 20 college according to USNWR, and is quite far from home.

&amp;nbsp;

Back in April, I was deciding between School A, another reputable university one state over, let's call it School B, and my instate flagship, School C. I never had a dream school during HS, and so my decision pretty much came down to School A vs. School B. It was a tough decision with no winner but I ended up choosing School A mostly because of family pressure and smaller size. However I was never really into School A that much, and even after May 1 I was seriously reconsidering my choice. I am an indecisive person by nature so naturally this college choice process was very difficult. 

&amp;nbsp;

I went to a summer orientation program at School A and was still not feeling too great about my choice. When I came back, I was thinking about visiting School C in town just to see if I might like it there better. But my parents told me not to and to just stick with school A.

&amp;nbsp;

Well I made it to School A, and so far I don't know if I'm truly happy there. Classes are challenging but first semester was fine. I am either a CS or accounting major. However, the distance from home is really depressing, I don't have friends, and I don't like the location of School A at all. I knew I disliked the location going in, but ignored it because of my family telling me to. I'm not excited about college at all, and only look forward to breaks when I can come home. But I HATE flying, so coming to and from home is really exhausting. I miss my family, my city, and my HS friends.

&amp;nbsp;

So I've been thinking throughout the semester whether I should transfer to School C, in town. My mom does not like the idea but told me to give School A a good shot for one year. I am going to do that, but I can't help but feel that I may be happier at School C. I am introverted and pretty asocial, so making friends is hard for me. I've tried at School A, and have only made some superficial acquaintances, people I just say ""hi"" to. I think a reason for that is I don't really like drinking, and that seems to be how most people on my floor are friends. School C is a VERY well known party school, so maybe I'm wrong in thinking I'd make friends here either, but I'd rather be friendless at home where I have my family than 1500 miles away.

&amp;nbsp;

Transferring would be a significant downgrade in ranking, but I'm not sure if for my two possible majors (CS or accounting) that it matters so much. I know I want to live and work either in my home state or one state over, and School C has a definite advantage in name recognition in these regions than School A. Additionally, I'd have to go through the process of orientation and adjusting to a new college all over again. School A also had some perks with regards to my required classes, as well as the perks of being a smaller school that a huge state school. These are I guess the reasons why my mom doesn't want me to transfer.

&amp;nbsp;


If you've read till here I thank you. This has been giving me incredible anxiety lately because I just don't know what to do. I really don't know if I want to spend 3.5 more years at School A, but I also don't know if I would even be happier or have any friends at School C. It might be harder to find people like me who don't enjoy parties at a huge party school. However, I might be more comfortable and less unhappy in my hometown, and it could give me an edge in finding internships/jobs in locations that I like. There would probably be a culture shock of going to a school 5 times as big, though.

I think a big part of my anxiety is not knowing what I want to major in. I know I don't have to decide immediately, but this could also be a factor. While I liked intro to CS, I don't know if I would like it as a career.

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: Not very happy at my top 20 college, unsure of whether transferring to my instate school is the right decision. 

Sigh. I wish I could just go back to high school.

608,TheEclipse0,1512972833,/r/college/comments/7j0e81/i_feel_really_discouraged_right_now/,"I need... Advise? Help? Shoulder to cry on? Not sure, but it looks like this will be a bad semester for me. I have four finals this time, and 2 I've already written. That's CMIS (computer management information systems) and Tax. CMIS went well, but tax... my best subject was probably the sloppiest exam I've ever written, due to not being able to sleep the night before.

I estimate, I'll probably score around 60% as my final mark in ALL of my subjects, aside from CMIS (which I estimate will be in the 80s). This is highly disappointing to me... But not for the most obvious reasons. Right now, my GPA sits at a 3.7... And I swear, I've tried... I've tried so hard. If they awarded marks for just trying, I'd be at the top of my class. In fact, all I do, from the time I wake up in the morning to the time I go to bed is to study... Because I want those marks, but I don't retain the information. There's... other things too. If I want to get in with a CPA firm - my marks matter. And... I'm an older gentleman who hasn't yet made it in the world, yet has been through college twice already (easier courses) with zero success. I'm frustrated with life, I just want to make more than minimum wage and work somewhere where my skills are actually appreciated. Accounting seems like a sure thing, but I know... I'm only in my second year... I know things get extremely difficult in third year.

I write financial accounting on tuesday and managerial on wednesday. I am not prepared for either. Especially managerial. I am quite distressed, and I just want it to be over already. :(

I spoke with an academic advisor, and they've given me a few ideas... They've noted I tend to cram, and that's true. I know I shouldn't, but I don't really know what else to do. So, they've said to work on the same questions I did in class, then do them again the next day, and then a month later. And that's a more effective study plan. I will do that, but I haven't been able to do it this semester because I spoke with them after midterms. 

The midterms are part of the problem. Like every other school, we had a midterm week, but the new dean has decided to get rid of it so we can have more instructional hours (we already had the most out of all the schools in my province).The result is instead of writing all my midterms in a week, I've had one mid term per week since the semester began, aside from the first month. I hate it. Everyone else hates it. It's been very unpopular with the students, but there's no indication this will change.

So, I had to stagger my studying... Where I would study for the one thing... And then just get further and further behind in everything else.

Not to mention my studies were delayed because my tax prof handed out an assignment for us to do in a highly advanced computer program that we had zero instructional hours on and had never seen before (and was convoluted as all hell to use)... And our CMIS prof handed out a (3 part!) assignment for us to do in SAP (enterprise resource planning). SAP is even more complicated, but at least we kind of had the benefit of an outdated guide that was using an old version of the program. Though I've had since the 16th of november to study, both of these assignments wasted a lot of my time as I tried to figure out how to use these programs.

That's my excuses anyway.

Throughout elementary/middle school/high school, with few exceptions, I was a straight A's student. I lettered in academics, mathematics, Spanish, and art, received four honors cords upon graduation, and was accepted into every college I applied to.

When I went to college it was a different story. 

I was double majoring in Psychology and Mathematics, was an active participant in the learning community, and ended my first semester with C's in most of my classes, and failed one of them. My parents chewed me out that I hadn't tried hard enough, and they were right, in part. And part of it was just that I hated class and hated getting up and walking to 8ams on the other side of class. 

So I went back for another semester. 

And came back with more or less the same grades. 

I worked during the summer and took a Calc I course at the local community college to get myself ahead from where I was behind in the math department, and learned how much I absolutely hated calculus. 

I went back to school in the fall and took Calc II, and took the required Stats class for Mathematics, and learned that I actually liked statistics, so later in the semester, after I failed Calc II, I switched to double majoring in Psychology and Statistics, and signed up to take Calc II again. I got elected as an officer of my school's Stat Alliance, and led projects in statistics consultation work. 

Then, I failed the intro Statistics class and Calc II. 

I called my mom up, crying, and told her that I was struggling so much in the things I liked, and she told me that she and my dad had talked and thought I should switch majors, and they had one picked out for me if I was willing to listen to what they thought I would be good in. 

With their recommendation, I went to my university's college of liberal arts counsellor and dropped both my majors in favor of a Communications major and Poli Communications minor. 

Doing so, I was terrified I would be adding years onto my degree, and I was afraid I wouldn't be able to make it to the end. 

As it turns out, not only can I graduate on time with all the electives I had taken, but it's even possible for me to graduate a semester early if I pushed for it. 

I've been in the degree less than a year, but by the end of this week, I will have finished and passed (some with flying colors!) all of the required introduction courses of the major and will be allowed to take any courses that interest me in the department. I'm looking at graduating as early as next December. 

Throughout this entire struggle, I was elected into the position of president of my campus residence hall's student body government, and was able to write most of my papers for my classes about the organization, and received more academic support from my advisors then I ever received from tutors and professors and counsellors. I'm now looking at running for a position on the regional board, but I know even now that my grades might restrict me from doing so. 

And yet, I've never been prouder of the work I put in this semester. I still don't have perfect grades, and there were a lot of assignments I straight up forgot to turn in that could have turned a C into a B, but compared to where I was last year, I'm a different person and I've grown a great deal. Last year I wondered if it was even worth it to finish school and if I should just start working full time at the local coffee place.  Now, I'm excited to finally reach graduation in 2018 or 2019, and actually start a career in something, anything. 

I have career aspirations, and realistically it may take years for me to begin achieving some of them due to academic history. But they aren't completely out of my reach just yet. 

I've got a lot of work I need to put in, but despite all of my failures, I still have a future in front of me. It's just changed a lot over the years.

Okay guys, so I have zero friends. I don’t mean best friends. I mean I don’t have anyone. I’m not introverted, I’m actually quite a bit extroverted. I’m totally normal (I’m hygienic, dress nice, have manners/social skills). 

I’ve tried every way to make friends.

“Join a club”
* So I joined literally SO MANY clubs this semester, none of them were what I thought. So 2 of them emailed me saying that the clubs were inactive. Another 2 do not meet, I’m still waiting on hearing if they’re even functioning. The remaining clubs are extremely antisocial. Like,  for one of them our meetings are once a month and we don’t have any events. We meet and “discuss club goals” so there’s no room to talk to anyone from there. The other club just hosts guest speakers.

I’ve been rejected from joining a ton of clubs because I’m not in the specific major. I can’t believe my school does that.

“Join a fraternity”
* I don’t have any money. I wish I could, though. But I get a bad vibe from most of the fraternities we have.

“Meet people from your classes”
* It’s not easy in 200 people lectures. I’ve met some “class fellows” but transcending our relationship out of the classroom has failed. I know we’re just like, class buddies. We don’t have anything else in common.

“Talk to people on your hall and leave your door open”
* I live with family and I can’t afford to change my housing situation.

“Get a job on campus”
I did. I HATED it so much, I didn’t want to do the work and it was obvious. I slacked and I got fired. Wasn’t phased. I have a job that’s from home now and I get paid twice the amount I did there.

“Go to events”
* My school literally isn’t doing shit. 

I’m lost, I don’t know what the hell to do. I might transfer colleges because I hate it here. I’ve even joined our subreddit and I haven’t met anyone. I can’t go to bars because I’m 18 by a few days. I think my age turns people off but I don’t really act mature. 

I live in a city with over a million people, but I’m in the bad part of it.  My school has 30,000 students. There’s no cool places to hang out here or on campus. It’s so impossible. I hate this.

612,hotpotatostick,1510954108,/r/college/comments/7do4md/at_a_standstill_with_crippling_social_anxiety_in/,"Background: 21 yr old female, been at the same college for 3 years, and I have made 1 friend that I still stay in touch with and am close to.

Going into college I thought I knew what I wanted. I went into college as an art major, with the intention of becoming an art teacher. Everyone said, ""Do something you will love when you pick your major, that way you never work a day in your life."" Well, the art school turned out to be not at all what I expected. The classes were a daunting 3 hours for twice a week and it was blatantly obvious the professors were struggling to fill in that time with work. My time in these classes kept slowing feeling devalued and useless. The criteria was never a challenge and soon I questioned the value of an art degree when my capabilities and intelligence were stronger than what I was doing.

I decided to go with what would make money. I switched to accounting. Although I was technically an accounting major, I never actually took an accounting class during that time. I took mostly the general requirements I needed for any major, along with some business classes. I started to psych myself out about accounting because I always struggled with math, and didn’t think I would like it. After this whole dilemma, I talked to my boyfriend who told me he knows my passion is art and that I am just not motivated because I am not enjoying what I am doing. He said I should try for graphic design. I began research GD and I loved it. It involved art but in a more professional and extended way.

At my school you have to take a candidacy class, and from there only half of the students are chosen to move up in the program. When I started, the waitlist was full and I tried to email the Pr. to see if I could possibly get in. She didn’t reply after a couple weeks so I showed up to her office and felt so awkward. She acted so stunned I showed up… I feel like this interaction made a bad impression… I eventually got in the class and actually really enjoyed it. I looked forward to the projects and felt like I was actually making use of my class time. I feel the professor in my section, for whatever reason, had a strong dislike towards me even though I always kept to myself. Any time I asked for help, when she encouraged questions, she seemed so annoyed with me. Her face said it all. This reaction really turned me away from asking questions. Yet when she talked to her favorites, she would light up. And in critique, she would contradict her suggestions to my projects. She would tell me to add a certain color, say she liked it in class, and in critique say she didn’t agree with it...I did exactly as the rubric asked and delivered what the professor asked of me but did so poorly grade wise. I recall in one critique both professors admiring my piece yet giving me a high C. Needless to say, I wasn’t accepted into the program, and after this, I sort of lost any motivation I had left in college.

I decided to pursue marketing. It is in a similar realm to graphic design, with advertising, which is what appealed most to me. I am almost done with the semester and am taking accounting, CIS, Intro Marketing, and Calculus. I love these classes,(exception of calc..failing)  they feel like real life skills I will use. I can see myself doing this. The only downfall is I haveterrible social anxiety and the requirements for my program involve 2 speech classes and the upper level marketing classes involve participation points and group projects. I just can’t see myself doing any of this because of how bad my anxiety is.I literally go out of my way just to avoid doing this. I have seeked help with my Dr and through several medications I found something is better than nothing but doesn’t cure my issues.I just feel so anxious sitting in class with people around. It literally makes me feel so tense and on edge and I hate it.

 I have looked into online college and am strongly considering WGU because it offers a marketing program and is strictly online. It looks reputable and has a strong following but I am unsure of how employers view an online degree as opposed to the traditional one. It would also be significantly cheaper but is this comparable to a traditional degree? I have my mind set on obtaining a degree but I see no end in sight to college, when I keep putting off these classes that involve public speaking or participation. I have a part time job, I have friends, a boyfriend, I just have a hard time with social anxiety and don’t want it to get in the way of my future. Any advice you have would be much appreciated. 

Tl;dr: I have social anxiety and have literally put off classes I know I need for my degree. I will eventually be at the end of my rope and have to take these classes but I just cant mentally see me being able to take them. I have gotten prescriptions from my Dr. that help somewhat but not really. I have been considering online college at WGU but feel like an online degree is frowned upon and not even considered. What are my options here when I have such a hard time with social anxiety?

However I'm looking for advice more than anything. I'm an 18 year old guy and I'm seriously struggling with socializing. I went to my state college, which is where tons of my high school classmates went, but I basically never see them anymore, they've all found new friends and go and party (which I'm not really mad about, isn't that what college is about?) But I literally haven't made a single new friend this semester. I've tried in my classes to be social with my classmates but I haven't found a friend yet. It seems like everyone in my classes has a friend or two already and they all sit together and usually people only sit 3 or 4 seats away from me, so it can be sort of hard to be social. I tried joining clubs, but unfortunately, it's kind of a hike to get to campus for me since I commute and I also have to worry about work. It's about a 40 minute walk to campus and I would drive but I don't have a place to park. Most of my friends from high school met friends from their dorm or from  their roommates but obviously I can't. Maybe too whiny or annoying, but it just kind of sucks to be sitting in my room on a Friday night watching other people's snap stories of parties and everybody having a good time. I was looking forward to college all throughout high school mainly because I was really shy in high school (I was a REALLY late bloomer and super self-conscious about it.) I saw college as a fresh start, but I'm starting to feel more and more like how I felt freshman year of high school. So I guess if you managed to get through this, my question would be, is there any advice you can give to improve my social life?

614,ShakyShrimp,1510558413,/r/college/comments/7cll77/has_homeschool_ruined_my_chances_of_going_to/,"So, obviously I'm homeschooled. I've been homeschooled since the second grade. I hate it but never had a chance to go back to public school (long story).
Frankly, I feel like homeschool has ruined me.
My school work was all done in school books my parents ordered off the internet. Some awful Christian program called ACE or something. It wasn't great education because they turned everything into some religious lesson which I feel like made my education suffer, especially when it came to science and history. I never did many school projects, just wrote a few papers here and there. Nothing special. I'm not a particularly smart person to begin with, I think I was doing like 2 grades lower than the grade I was actually in on some things, most likely math, maybe I lagged behind on English a bit too. I don't think my parents even kept the books. I think after I did the work in them we just threw them out. They were just paper books. We probably recycled them. We don't have records of my work or anything. Didn't keep much track of grades. My mom would just score the books based on what they said. We had no connections to a public school whatsoever. There's no real evidence that I ever actually did a day of school work. I'm currently studying GED books (which I suppose acts as my ""senior year"") and will (hopefully) get my GED this spring. That's what my older sisters did.
It's hard for me to get jobs because in interviews they always ask about achievements and accomplishments and ask about school related stuff and I never have a thing to say. Just ""I don't know"".
So I know a scholarship is out of the question, and my family really doesn't have a lot of money, so I really probably couldn't even afford college. I don't really know what financial aid or student loans are. 
I honestly don't know how college works. I've tried looking into it but there's just so much. Bachelors degree, associates degree, etc., community college, university, etc. I just don't understand what any of it means or the difference between those things.

So, with the little knowledge I have of this stuff, my ""plan"" is to get my GED, do a few years of community college (another thing I'm confused about. How many years am I supposed to do of community college? 2? 4? Idk), then go to a university. An arts school. (I'm into art, filmmaking, etc. and know of several school near me for this).
So, with this information, what would you advise? Does my ""plan"" sound good? Realistic? Is there hope for me? Can you please explain some of the things I'm confused about? Thanks in advance.

615,TossedCook,1510100960,/r/college/comments/7bhkmf/is_leave_of_absence_the_right_choice/,"Now, for context. I'm an Asian-American male in a STEM major (CS). I recently made the decision to change to Business, but enough about that. This will be a bit of a long read, but I'll put a TLDR at the end.

For as long as I can remember, I've had feelings of anxiety, depression, and semi-suicidal thoughts, among other things. They've been building for years now, and I kept quiet because I thought that I would look weak for choosing or even wanting to go to therapy.

I think some parts of my childhood contributed to a lot of my current feelings. From infancy to the age of 7, it was customary for my parents to fight like hell on weekends. Imagine, a young child, supposed to worry about how many pancakes he'll be able to eat on Saturday, having to worry about his mother and father screaming at each other, throwing things, threatening for divorce, etc. It SUCKED. Even now, I still do this thing when I'm home where I gauge how they are with one another. I hated seeing them fight when I was a kid, it really hurt me. I knew and know that they love me, but I was just so fearful of them drifting away from each other. One time, my mom walked out of our apartment, and I had to chase after her, crying. Another time, my dad dropped her off in a parking lot with me in the back, and told her, ""Have a nice life."". I started crying on the spot. My sister never had to see it as much; they really lessened their arguments after her birth.

My main feelings of depression and anxiety started in my sophomore or junior year in high school. I wasn't exactly in the best position academically at the time due to some friend problems that really hit me hard. Toward the end of sophomore year, I started questioning if it was good that I was born, primarily because my academics weren't going well and I had grown distant from people who I thought were my friends. In addition, I asked these questions internally because I felt like me (and my sister being born) were the only things keeping their marriage together. There were a lot of instances where my mother and father told me that I was just a cross to bear, but that was mainly because they were angry for things I said or did.

The summer after my sophomore year, I think I remember June 2015 more for sleeping than anything else. I just felt so angry at myself and tired and lonely that I curled up on my basement couch and snuggled under a blanket. I only got up to eat, shower, use the bathroom, or work out (occasionally). I was a lot more irritable. I was very high strung, due to falling outs that I had with ""friends"" and my grades sinking, and I took out my anger (vocally) onto my family. After a month, I got up (since I had SAT/ACT prep and tennis offseason) and told myself that I had to get my shit together. It worked that year, I moved higher up on the tennis team's ladder, my grades improved, things were good. And then I got one B on my junior year report card. One B out of several As. The depression hit again; I felt like a fuck-up. But I wanted to slay the next year of high school.

My senior year was more known for the extreme falling out I had with a friend. This same friend was a source of anger and trouble for me in my sophomore year. He wanted my help for college apps and academics. Now, me being more of a yes man than I should be, I said 'yes'. But then, I started thinking harder about if it was the right move; hey, he could turn on me, fuck me over or something. So I decided to shift away from him. He noticed, and retaliated strongly. He told ANOTHER friend of mine some lie about me wanting to kill him, and I lost this person's friendship. I had had enough, I wanted to cut him off for good, away from me. But he didn't get it; he followed me around, tried to sit next to me everywhere. Because of this, for most of my senor year, I was angry. I would wake up angry some days, go to bed angry. Wake up sad some days, go to bed sad some days. It grew really hard having to wake up in the morning, knowing I had to go to school and deal with him. All the while, I got into 10/15 schools, got two scholarships to one of them, and am attending that one now (Fuck Michigan. :P). Eventually, he stopped after I raised my voice to him one day. We never spoke again, but after senior year, and even during the summer, I felt really insecure about the whole thing. I thought he was trying to throw subtle jabs and disrespectful remarks my way whenever we saw each other, and I thought he wanted to fight me. So, what did I do but work out like crazy, lose a lot of weight, gain some muscle, etc. I think it was more obsessive than anything, to be honest.
Now, to the main part:

I attend a good college near the Midwestern US. I started school in mid-August. Now, like all freshmen, I missed home a lot. My family built such a good home life for me in recent years, that I was too adjusted to and comfortable with. Now, I say missed, but I mean to say ""miss"". I miss it a lot. I miss driving my car, seeing my friends, sleeping in my bed, etc. It's put me in bad spells this semester, where it's really hard to get out of bed in the morning.

I can't trace back to when this first started happening, but lately, I think I've had more concrete suicidal thoughts. Like, before going to a math recitation, I went to the bathroom, and looked at the courtyard below. I thought, ""Man, it would be so easy to jump down and end it all right here."". Today, after a less than ideal Engineering midterm (probably failed), I thought about how easy it would be to go back to my room, take a lot of pills, and end my life. These thoughts have been cutting into me lately. I had these thoughts when I had my math midterm, when I did my CS midterm yesterday, and even today with my engineering one. They've just been ramping up even more and more with each passing day, and I'm scared now.

I've gone to see counseling, I do group therapy and one-on-one, but it isn't enough. It doesn't feel like enough. Plus, I'm so worried about my slipping grades too, so that's been adding to my self-loathing and thoughts of ending it. I feel like I study a lot, try to learn (not just memorize), but when it comes time to step up to the plate, I blank and mess things up now.

In addition, I may have an attention problem of some kind. I see the tasks I need to do, I make a plan for it, but then the plan goes to shit and doesn't get followed. I get easily distracted by things near me or around me, and it's hard to put my phone away. Plus, I've exhibited some compulsive behavior as well, such as checking my grades over and over to see if assignments have come in, even if they haven't yet or if I just took them that day.

Last, I think another problem is that I just never wanted to study CS. I primarily picked it up to make my parents happy. All I've ever wanted was to make them happy and proud of me. If I had chosen business, I would be a direct admit right now, which makes me regret choosing CS. I think this also adds to my depression, knowing that a better choice existed for me but I didn't take it. CS, and engineering in general here, feels really gloomy. No instructor, TA, or anyone seems happy, whereas the people I've met over in the business school are seemingly so driven and animated in how they do things.

So, here's where my big question comes in: is a leave of absence the right move? If I'm really having this much anxiety, depression, and this many suicidal thoughts, and if counseling isn't helping here, AND if my grades are declining because of these things, would a leave of absence be the right move? I think these things have been building for years, and the time when they burst out most for people (college) is hurting it more. I never talked about it all those years because I was afraid and felt weak for even considering going to therapy, and I feared disappointing or embarrassing my parents.

My idea is to go back home for this semester, and come back next semester with a better handle on my issues. I've called the financial aid office already about how this might affect my scholarship, and have talked to my academic advisor already about it. My advisor has given me the forms needed to petition for a leave of absence.

TLDR: Have had semi-suicidal/existential thoughts, depressive feelings, and anxiety in the past, seems to have ramped up in college as well, but to the point where my thoughts of suicide are more concrete. Have also exhibited obsessive and attention problems that may have gone unnoticed by many. Grades are slipping, and I don't feel happy at this time with what I do or am doing.",college,Is leave of absence the right choice?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7bhkmf/is_leave_of_absence_the_right_choice/,1510118960.0

We recently took a test and I scored a 95, while he scored a 40. He goes around to say how he only studied 30 or so minutes beforehand, and how he would have easily gotten a better grade than me if he actually tried. Btw, I did not demean him or mention anything bad about his grade. He straight up just said this without any warning after we shared our results to each other.

Ok, I understand that some people could study little and get A's, but then that's a matter of intellect IMO. I spent several hours studying for this test. I do not think I am a genius with high IQ or whatever, rather I do work hard to learn the material. I honestly think he could do the same if he put in the time, but his comment was honestly like a slap to the face to me and EVERYONE else that studies hard to get a good grade. He basically demeaned everyone's efforts and classified it as ""easy"".

It's one thing if you are producing the results, and another if you are not (getting a 40). I just found the comment to be extremely rude and upsetting because I know other friends in various majors that do study A LOT and put in a ton of effort in school. To have someone pass it off as nothing is not something I sit well with.

During the summer, I went to a program that made me extremely excited for school. I have a loving family, who truly cares for me and makes my life easier, but they put extreme pressure on me going and finishing school. Its only been a couple weeks, and I'm ready to quit. 

I live 2 hours away from campus, but thankfully I set my schedule up in way that allows me to go only 2 days a week, which isn't hard. I know I just failed an exam, which is 55% of my grade, but I learned how to accept failure and become better. I was always a student who was able to grasp things easily (not a good student, don't study, and sometimes don't do homework, but I always pulled through the tests by paying attention in class, I know thats going to have to change ). If I fail this class, I will not retake it for a long time.

I have a history of exploding at least 4 times in the past 3 years: Beating on metal poles until the bones in my fist were broken and swollen, head-butting walls until blood drips from my chin, and biting myself are things that characterize these random bouts of rage. In fact, my right index finger is bigger than my left due to excessive biting. At this point I feel that I am a constantly over-flowing cup, no matter how much I express myself more always appear. I feel empty, and have no motivation for school. I feel this rage coming up, and I don't want to have it in school like I did in 10th grade ( happened more than once during that year). I feel that this time, it will be worse than all the other times. The worst part about it is that extremely small things trigger it, like dropping a pencil. I feel like going today will make me explode, but I feel that my grades will bleed because this will be the 5th day I missed. They bleed everytime I don't attend.

I feel that this is attributed to the denial of my depression for years. This is the first time that I admitted that I have depression. I just got done crying, and I almost got teary-eyed writing this. I thought of suicide multiple times, and if I didn't have family and friends I cared about, I probably would've tried to do it already. 

I act happy for my friends and family, but I just can't anymore. I'm starting to unintentionally damage the relationships with my friends and family. 

I hate myself for it, and I'm starting to hate the world. It's gotten to the point about me wondering about the aftermath of suicide, and whether it is more favorable than living (which it shouldn't be, and as long as I have family and friends I will never do it). 

My mother always asks about whether or not i'm depressed, and everytime, I denied it. I recently admitted to it. Based on the stories that the older members of my family often tell, she has been through hell growing up, and I feel ungrateful for not feeling happy about my life, and school.

I feel burnt out from all my years in school, all I did was go to school, go home, robotically study(rarely), go back to school. I didn't do any activities because my school didn't have any that interested me, nor did it allow me to create a club for my interest (boxing). I felt like taking a gap year and I might (if its still possible) just to cool down and see what I could accomplish. But I feel its too late to do that. 

All the pressure for success in the future is killing me slowly. The money, job, house, happiness. At this point, I just want my happiness.

As a child, I was extremely happy all the time, even in the poverty I grew up in. Those were some of the happiest times of my life, and I would do almost anything to be that happy again.

I like my school and my classes, but I feel very lonely and isolated here. I get along with my roommate, we’re not exactly friends, but we get along just fine and respect each other but that’s about it since we don’t have anything in common. 

I made a few friends last year, but since I commuted from home, I didn’t get the chance to get really close with anyone or establish a big group of friends. One of my friends is taking a leave of absence this semester, and the others live on the opposite end of campus in their sorority houses, so I don’t see much of them either since they’re usually busy with Greek life stuff and such, which is definitely not for me. 

I’ve tried to join clubs, but so far I haven’t really clicked with anyone. They’re usually just there to get some volunteer hours in and leave, or they’ve already established friend groups within the club and I just get left out, which is totally understandable. I don’t expect them to go out of their way to include me, a stranger, in things. In class, people are friendly enough, but we don’t hang out outside of class very much. I’m always the one who has to initiate hanging out with people either to dinner or to study and whatnot, but it usually fizzles out and we don’t do it again because we don’t have much in common. To add to that, A LOT of people here come from very affluent families, and as a first generation middle class college student, I find it hard to find people to relate to. 

I’m very shy/introverted, so being alone isn’t so bad all the time, but there are still moments where I get very lonely and sad. The only time I get really happy is when I get to go home, which I do every weekend. Other advice forums say to stop going home so much and to find stuff to do on campus, but honestly, being home with my family makes me so much more happy than hanging out with people from my college. I pretend to be doing great here whenever my family FaceTimes me, but in reality I’m a bit miserable. I don’t want them to worry about me, especially since they know I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression in the past. 

I don’t really know what to do. I’ve tried a lot of things to improve my situation, and I really really with all my heart just want to live at home again and commute to school. Commuting can suck sometimes too, with traffic and bad weather and everything, but at least I got to go home to my family everyday, and they really miss me too. But I also feel torn about staying at least until the end of the school year and make attempts to make more friends. What should I do?

619,katparry,1508795503,/r/college/comments/78b680/existential_crisis_in_progress_messy/,"Hello /r/college, I've been a lurker on here for quite some time. I'm about to dump a lot of stuff on you:


&amp;nbsp;

Background:

&amp;nbsp;

Longer story shorter, I'm 28 and in CC. I worked for 10 wonderful years in project management at a Fortune 50 company (making very good money with no degree), and was doing very well in my beloved career, but alas my husband got a job in D.C. and thus we moved. Instead of going back into the workforce I decided it was time to get my degree, something that I've wanted since I was young. Its something that I personally want to do to prove to myself that I can do because I tried to go to college once before and it was a massive failure (tl;dr really chaotic homelife, poor af, and stress made it really hard. Also I was not ready) so I went into the workforce instead. I was encouraged by a professor (that I took philosophy classes from while I was working full time) to continue to pursue academia... and he was right...I love school, I love learning, I'm a sponge, and I'm doing super well here. I'm very happy in school, and I dont ultimately regret my decision, but i is at the same time ruining my life because of the lack of ""knowns"".

&amp;nbsp;

Issue 1: Picking a Major

&amp;nbsp;

I can't seem to pick a major between Anthropology, Sociology, and .....Photography (photojournalism to be precise). In regards am not looking to get a ""job"" out of my degree because I am purely going to school to learn. I am a firm believer that the process of getting the liberal arts degree has great value, not to mention I have learned more in the three semesters of CC than I did during all of my other school years combined. I can only imagine what its going to be like to get deep into a major program and learn more.

&amp;nbsp;

I love photography because it takes me to new places and I'm good at it. It gives me satisfaction (when I like my own work), and It challenges me to always change my perspective. I love cultural anthropology because I love learning about a culture, food, the rituals, relationships, the politics, language. I love traveling and getting people's stories on their lives, their families, and so I usually pair my photography with a photo essay when I go. This is something that I've been doing since I was very little.  I love sociology because it involves systems and theory, which is where my mind loves to play. I also love philosophy and political science for the same reasons. It is a pure joy for my mind when I'm in these classes, I feel like I'm lifted out a deep dark hole of my depression and awestruck by the amazingness (or awfulness) of the human race whenever I get back from a good lecture. 

&amp;nbsp;

The issue I'm having is how do you discern between ""beloved hobby/subject"" and buckle down to ""undergrad major"". 

&amp;nbsp;


Issue 2: Picking a Transfer Institution

&amp;nbsp;

Its transfer season, so all of this seems to be weighing so heavily on my mind. I'll have three semesters under my belt, and four by the time I get into whatever institution I do get in to. My issue is that I have family members that are telling me that I shouldn't go to universities like Georgetown or GWU if I get in because its going to cost a lot of money...I'm really pining to go to those schools because of the curriculum and the teachers. I've been to the campus, Ive sat in on the classes. They are amazing schools. The family members I'm staying with think that me going to school without the solid idea of ""getting a job"" out of it is inconceivable. These are people who went straight from HS to Ivy League schools and had the money to pay for it. They had ideas that they wanted to be lawyers and teachers and whatnot since they were young, an apparently no one in this group has ever struggled with the ultimate life question ""what should I do with my time"". For the first time in my life I'm regretting being unconventional. I feel like a newborn baby deer learning to walk. Going to work after highschool was easy. I tried to avoid all this by giving up college, and this time I want to see it through.

&amp;nbsp;


So its getting to me. I feel strongly that it shoudln't matter that I don't *know* what I want to do on the job front because I'm going to get a job after. I'm highly employable. What the job is, where it is, I do not know, but I already feel that my time in college is opening me up to so many more possibilities. Values are very important to me, and the job that I have later after school will absolutely reflect my values and leverage the skillsets that I have built from my previous employment. I would not give a moment of my precious life-time to something that doesn't matter to me. I'm not worried about the future job prospects, I know I'm going to make it work.... but I am worried about the debt that school is going to pile on top of me. And if I'm going to be in debt, I want to make sure that I got a damn good education. So if I can ditch these feelings, and try and grow a thicker skin to shield myself from family members, I feel like I can largely ignore #2 and just worry about picking a major and picking how much debt I want. 

&amp;nbsp;


I currently have a 4.0 GPA and in a greek thing that opens up opportunities for me....also another honors program at my school that is AMAZING. (I've learned so much from honors classes!)  I've been getting good scholarships based on my merit at CC already, so I'm hoping that I would continue to get scholarships at whatever institution I get to attend. But I won't know what these financial aid packages look like until I get them. So I'll just have to wait for that. 

&amp;nbsp;


Conclusion: 
So I guess I'm just half-venting, half-asking if I'm nuts. Should I just bail on school and go back into the workforce, the thing that I'm good at? Am I ruining my life? What should I pick as a major? Does it really even matter for undergrad? Is it so bad that I just want to go to school to get a well-rounded liberal arts education? Should I just ignore these people or does my idealism need to be crushed with an iron fist?

620,asdjklghty,1508702899,/r/college/comments/782lrl/letting_others_know_you_were_homeschooled/,"So I was reading a thread earlier and it reminded me about my childhood. To save time I'm going to copy my reply to that post here.

My parents tried to mold me and my siblings into a version of what they wanted us to be. I've been homeschooled until university and even to this day my parents don't know how it's like. They're starting to but that's not good enough.
It's annoying because society still expects you to be educated outside of home so when meeting people they'll take you less seriously when they find out you're home educated. I always try to avoid talking about my previous education but I can't forever and when people always lead headfirst with ""what high school did you go to?"" My parents kept saying, ""home school allows you to avoid x and x. Your time is more flexible so you can do more"".

Lies. I couldn't get into sports until later in life. And as a second year student (Im 19) I hate telling people I'm learning to drive when others already can. And I didnt want to learn earlier bevause I was preoccupied with other stuff I finally could do and I didn't know I was allowed to learn because my mom always said, ""You shouldn't learn to drive unless you can get a car. Driving is a skill you need to keep practicing"". What she didnt take into account is learning to drive takes time. Not everyone is like my parents who learned later in life when they moved from Hong Kong, England to Canada. Their silence is almlst like they were embarrassed to finally tell me if I could learn to drive finishing high school.

And that leads me to another thing which is asking stuff. Do you think if you keep getting ""no's"" you're going to be inclined to keep asking for stuff? But I find it unfathomable how my parents don't know this. Or at least not admit it. And there are tons of other stuff I could say.

Tl;dr being so controlling and trying too hard to raise your kids without issues you experienced wasn't something I knew until this year.

And I read this page and it really brought out some sad thoughts

&gt;Your choice to homeschool was never about us. It was about control, it was about you. It was about creating little robots that mimicked your beliefs

But I'm back to my procrastination and lack of motivation that I was on in HS.  HS was easy for me, I did super well with little work.  I am quickly learning that this is not how college works.

I have a very hard time motivating myself to do homework and I always make internal excuses as to why I don't have to do it (i.e., if I need to go back to slides and write notes out from class, I tell myself, ""Oh, i don't REALLY need this"", or, ""I'll do it later"")
I consider myself relatively intelligent when I put my mind to it (I mean, I got 70's/75's on my exams without studying and I've heard that's good). 

I think that a large part of my issue is that we never had to take midterms or final exams in high school.  I have absolutely no idea how to study for any type of large test, and I also believe that I have poor note-taking strategies. I've tried looking it up on the internet and some things are helpful but it's still a struggle for me to focus.  This is a huge concern for myself.

Another issue is that I'm stressed about what I want to do in life.  I know that this is normal, but as someone who likes to have everything planned out, it is causing a great amount of distress in my life.  I am majoring in Neuroscience at the moment, which I love the thought of.  However, I've been told that it's hard to find a job.  I plan on getting my Masters or PhD but I don't want to waste my time if I can't get a job in the future.  (I was actually fine with this choice until last weekend, when my cousin told me that two people who work at her call center majored in neuroscience at my university and now are working at... well... a call center).  My job considerations include maybe research with pharmaceuticals and drugs and how they interact with the body on a neurological level, but I'm not even sure if this is a sustainable career.

I don't really know what I enjoy to do but I want a well-paying job.

622,throwawaykurama,1508087657,/r/college/comments/76k82d/need_advice_i_really_am_struggling_at_my_current/,"I didn't attend UNC Asheville out of choice, it was the only college where I recieved a good financial aid package, and I didn't get accepted into a lot of schools because of my ACT score of 30. Regardless of this, I went in bound and determined to have a good experience and make the most of out it. My university is a 4 year college with around 3,000 students, and officials told me this would be a good fit for me because of the tight knit community and rigorous academics. I have Autism, dyscalculia (learning disability in math), Generalized anxiety disorder, and depression, so I wanted to believe this. I tried to make friends at orientation, joining clubs, interacting with people in class, or talking to others online from my college with no dice. Everyone found their group during orientation or within the first month, I didn't.


I had a doctor's note describing my disabilities and that I needed accomadation, but the school decided to put me with a roomate anyway (THEY EVEN TOLD ME IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WANTED PROFIT) , and I hated it. It took them a month, and multiple visits to the school health center, for them to switch me to a suite with 2 others, and I couldn't get along with them either. They are close friends who were comfortable with the doors having no lock, and the shower being out in the open with no door, and were constantly sitting right outside my door. I tried to stay there for a few weeks, tried to force myself to adjust- doctor even put me on a cocktail of anxiety meds to try and help me be able to live there, but I couldn't. Dorm life is not for autistic people. I have a childhood friend that I have known for over 6 years that I stay with off campus, which is what I wanted to do originally, but the school said no, cause my tuition would have been free without the dorm fee! I've been trying for over a month to get a job but I don't think anywhere will hire me because the school makes me park my car 2 miles away- even though I have a note saying I need access to go to doctors appointments. I can't get hired on campus either.


No one on campus is very friendly outside of their preestablished cliques, clubs are largely inactive, or meet very late at night. One club meets from 9pm to 2 am on saturdays, and if I wanted to be in it, they told me I would have to come every single Saturday or I wouldn't be allowed to participate. 2/3 of the school commutes anyway, and no one cares about doing anything on campus, not even the freshman who they force to live there. I tried to do club sports, but I'm the only beginner and don't fit in, I don't think anyone likes me anyway cause I'm awkward. No one wants to be my friend. I don't think my professors like my either with the exception of one.


I'm in honors, and only taking one honors class, but the general ed classes are extremely hard, and worse than my honors class! I took AP in high school, so I expected difficulty, but not as much as I am facing. For one, no one here seems to care that I have a learning disability. I am going to math tutoring for hours almost every day except one every week, doing all of my homework multiple times until I get 100%, studying my ass off, only to barely make a C. I don't get extra test time, and I am barely able to scrape by. I cry because my math class stresses me out so bad. I want to major in computer science, so I thought maybe my programming class would be my solace, but it is just as difficult. No one knows what they're doing, I've tried to reach out to others in my class and they don't know how to do the assignments or are just googling them. My professor is only in his office when I have other classes, and I will probably have to sacrifice some of my math tutoring time to start going to computer science tutoring because I am so lost, we are moving so fast and no one can do the work that is assigned.


I go to counseling every week, I'm on antidepressants, and I'm trying so hard but nothing gets better.

624,FossilFeathers,1507140396,/r/college/comments/749yqm/is_college_not_for_me/,"New here but I really need advice.


I’ve been out of high school since 2012. Since then I went to community college &amp; graduated with an associate’s in biology, completed an internship, taken a few semesters off to work, switched around different schools and programs, and overall tried to figure out what I want to do next. College has always seemed like a pressure expected by my parents and society, and up until last year I was making A’s and B’s at a nearby university going into a BS in Environmental Biology. Now I’m about 2 semesters away from graduating and finding that I really can’t put the effort into my classes anymore. My degree doesn’t interest me, I despise lab work, and I don’t want to do anything specific in the field if I even was to graduate. I just can’t care about it anymore. At the start of this semester when I thought I wanted to come back, my parents were (understandably) getting tired of paying for classes that I was failing, and so made me pay for this round until I passed them. Now I’ve sunk over $4000 into this semester that I’m thinking about dropping and no longer have any kind of savings cushion to get on my feet outside of school. I don’t want to go to tutoring for my classes or counseling for any social anxiety/depression because I think it’s mostly environmental and caused by the stress of not having my life together.

The only ‘career’ I have ever considered would be to work with exotic animals. My pets are what keep me sane, and I enjoy teaching people about them and learning about birds, reptiles, and other exotics. But most zoo jobs require more experience than degrees, and I don’t want to sink more time doing volunteer work after graduating if I could just quit school and do them now. Recently it seems like I may have got my break – a local exotic reptile shop has a hiring event this weekend and I’m scheduled for an interview this Saturday. I’m so incredibly nervous even though I feel like I’m overly qualified (I’ve interned at the zoo, worked at Petsmart, and have personal experience with keeping lots of odd pets) but I don’t want to put all my eggs in one basket. If I were to get this job, I’d be more than happy to drop all the classes I’m currently in to work there fulltime. But I just feel like I’ve done this a thousand times already – dropping school to make money only to be guilted somehow into thinking I need to finish my degree. Now I’m just broke and miserable and don’t want to show my face around the house because I think my parents know I’m skipping and not happy but I don’t even know how to explain it to them for the 100th time that I’m not happy in school and just as frustrated as they are.

I essentially knocked out most of my Gen Eds, and earned 27credit hours. I worked hard my freshman year, and maintained an easy 4.0. 

Sophomore year, I did alright in the fall, but my motivation was almost non-existent. I realized I wasn't on the path I wanted to be on, and that my life was headed in the wrong direction. I wasn't happy. In the spring, I basically ghosted 100% of my classes. I might as well have not attended at all. My junior year, I did just that: I made a small attempt to attend class at the beginning of both semesters, but I couldn't force myself to keep it up, no matter how hard I tried. I earned straight Fs for three semesters in a row. 

I identified my issues, and am working on fixing them currently. When I'm done fixing myself up, I will return to school. I'm facing a 1.9 GPA. I absolutely want to finish my degree.

Since I moved in a dorm(it's been 3 days), I tried to be close to them but it is really hard for me.

I like all my classes so at least I have something to look forward to but now that it's the weekend, I can't think anything to do besides going to the library and finishing homework. 

I had 2 friends from high school who I hung out with in the first weekend before classes started and they even formed their own squad which I hung out with but they ended up excluding me from the group on the 2nd day cause I wasn't in the same dorm as them. I mean I understand that I live further away from all of you guys but can't you just text me whenever you go out?!  😕

Clubs don't start till next week and I just don't know what to do till then. Literally everywhere I go I see someone hanging out with at least one other person. Most of these freshman groups were formed during orientation but when I tried to talk to them they either ignored me or talked for like a minute and then walked away. So orientation ended up being pretty lonely too. I know it's only the first week but I really can't help but feel like I've already missed the opportunity to have a group of friends. 

No one on my floor wants to hang out either. I kept my door open for most of the first week but no one was interested. My roommate and I get along well but we don't talk that much since we have completely different interests.

Clubs are probably gonna be my last resort. I was gonna try a tennis club,  a science fiction club,  and a coding club since these were my main interests but...a part of me feels like this is gonna fail like everything else. 

I'll definetly still try as hard as I can in my classes and get my computer science degree since my parents spent a lot of money for me to be here but I hate having to lie to them about hanging out with friends when I'm really just wandering the campus alone.

From 2008-2014, I was in and out of school at my local community college. I tend to start the classes and midway fall behind or I stop going. I have 3 passing grades, 4 fails, and about 25 withdraws accumulated in those 6 years.

I suffer with depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I would get super pumped and motivated and 2 months in that eventually that goes away. I feel overwhelmed and a lot of times it was hard to leave the house. I finally sought help for mental health and am on medication, which helps a lot.

The program I eventually want to get into says this is its application:

""*2. An overall grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required of all college courses already attempted and listed on your
official transcripts. Please refer to the CCSF college catalog for determining your grade point average.*

*a. Academic history of more than four (4) incomplete grades, withdrawals, repetition of prerequisite courses, due to failures, academic probation, etc., may cause your application to be disqualified.
More than four is considered excessive by the DMI program and an indication of academic problems.*

*b. If you have this type of academic problem, an essay explaining the reasons for your academic history may be included with your application. However, this essay is not a guarantee of admission but will be taken into consideration.""*



Its been almost 4 years since I tried with school. Can I start fresh? or does the transcript follow me forever? Also, my local community college is not the same district as CCSF.",college,28yo applying for college again.

Barely top third in my class.

Next year I am taking 4 APs, a Pre-AP, and two honors.

After junior year I'll have 23 credits.

I was in theatre for 1 and a half semesters but I quit. I have performed in several selective improv shows at the show.

I have performed at a theatre community for several years but I haven't been active recently. I was also part of the improv team there for several years and during the summer I have taught younger kids about improv for two straight years and will be doing it for a third time this summer.

I have performed at a state wide theatre conference five times during the summer, and I have won an all star cast award and could(???) win another this year.

I am a Texas resident and am hoping to maybe get into UT Austin, Trinity, or A&amp;M.

I'd love to go to Rice but I understand how unlikely it is for me to get in.

I honestly had my mind in other places than school freshman year, so I ended up doing pretty bad in most of my classes, and failing Algebra 2. 

&amp;nbsp;

Sophomore year: I tried much harder and got much better grades (all A’s and B’s), and passed algebra 2. The only downside here is that I took no honors/AP courses except for AP computer science, which I got a A+.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, my Junior year I decided to skip algebra 3 and go straight to CP Precalculus. I struggled, pretty hard to start off in that class. While I did understand everything at the end of the year, the damage had been done. For my junior year, I got all A’s and B’s, with the exception of PreCalc, which was a D+. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have learned a ton from my failures in high school, and FEEL very ready for the rigorous workload of college. But now, I’m concerned I won’t make it in with my GPA + SAT. My GPA is a 2.9 (UW) and a 3.4 (W), with a 1250 SAT. I know everyone says colleges love improvement, but with the dip in junior year with PreCalc, how does that factor in?

&amp;nbsp;

As for other factors, I’m a Caucasian male. I have participated in High School Cross Country, Mock Trial, and Key Club. I work as a team leader for Best Buy since my Sophomore year. I have also participated in Boy Scouts, but did not become a Eagle Scout. My mother also attended USC.

&amp;nbsp;

I’d love to hear some thoughts. I don’t know what to think honestly, as some people have told me I should get in, but others have told me it’s a stretch. Sorry if this came out a bit long.

I graduated from high school in 2016. I took a year off to save up money and buy a car, but some issues came up and I'm taking a second year off. So I'm trying to start college in the fall of 2018.

The only problem is my high school taught me absolutely nothing. I literally have no idea where to start. My counselors knew I was taking a gap year and decided not to tell me anything and I was stupid and didn't ask to know anything. Any advice would be very helpful.

Here's some info:
I want to have a bachelors in botany. I graduated high school with a 3.6 GPA and I was in a lot of extracurricular  activities. I've been employed since I graduated, and within the month I will be working a full time job and part time job.

Here are some questions I have:
1) FASFA. Can I still apply to it even though I'd be graduated for two years? When should I apply?

2) A lot of my friends went to community college to get the unnecessary stuff out of the way (I guess stuff like english and math). Where can I find out what classes I need to take to be a  botanist? I tried looking around on a few college websites but couldn't find anything.

3) After I finish all the unnecessary stuff, then would I be ""transferring"" to an actual college? When would I apply and how hard is the process?

4) A lot of my friends didn't have a choice about living on campus, they had to do it. I'll be 21 when I go to college so that doesn't really appeal to me. Is there any way that I can opt out?

I failed a test (a MIDTERM, not just a test) for the first time in college (failed another one recently). No matter how hard I studied for some tests, I just couldn't get the grade I wanted. There were so many nights I stayed up just to study and I even took Adderall for the first time (will never take again because of the horrible after effects and it didn't even help anyway).

We can't all do what we love, that's capitalism for you, and I just pray that I do not fall in this category as I would live a miserable non-fulfilling life.

Will getting a part-time job open me to a new perspective to how I need to take on more responsibilities and develop proper work ethics?

For all I know my bachelor will have no purpose in my career path, but life has no seconds chances, and if I missed this opportunity of a safety net where my education is being paid by my parents who support me, and as I regrettably take the responsibility of it and the means to finance my education.

I was hoping for a summer one, but I took this one and went to school part time. It turns out that I need to actually take a summer class or I would push back my graduation. It's complicated because I have no idea if I will be retained for the summer or not.

For the most part I like the internship. The work is kinda tedious and boring, but not too hard. Why do I not know if I will be retained for the summer? I have gotten zero feedback from anyone about anything. I have no clue whether I am doing a good job or a bad job. I try to do a good job. What makes it even harder to tell is that the other intern looked openly lackadaisical most of the time, spending more time on his phone then working, and he basically got moved into a bigger, more important role. Meanwhile, I would work my butt off and I never had anything said to me, really. The difference between me and him, though, is he is graduated and I am not.
I guess I wouldn't mind walking away from the internship. There are some things I don't like about the place. There are many tribal rules, and people are not very good at explaining things. You more or less have to learn on your own. Also, the guy I am an intern for is not really there for me on anything. What I mean is that if I have an issue with something, and I email him, he rarely responds. Even any other question, he rarely responds, and I am left hanging. I'm the type of person who likes things resolved, and when he says he will take a look at something, when I have to actually go to his office and talk to him, he never gets back to me. I never know if the problem is fixed or not.

Also, sometimes the company pushes me into working extra hours. For example, when I started, they asked if O wanted to work 60 hours. Uhm, no I take classes at night, and they know that. The one week, they pretty much made me work 60 hours when I had an 2 exams that week. I gave them what I could work, but they kind of just scrapped it. When I interviewed, they told me 35-40 hours a week, not 60. How do I approach this situation? I have to take this summer class. Do I just ask if I am staying over the summer or not?

Now im in my second semester, and i took math 259 (precal/trig) i thought well maybe i dropped it becuase i did not try hard enough, same thing is happening now at home do my homework with some struggle but i get it done i just took my math second math test on Friday and i got a D. The first one i also got a D. The math does not  stay in my head.

At this rate i am also going to drop this math class, which would be two semesters now that i have dropped it.And so now as much as i love programming, im gonna have to switch majors because i will never be able to pass my math classes unless i drop down and honestly i just dont wanna waste the time on that.

The reason i think i am struggling on math is because i went to a independent studies high school. And honestly the classes are trash hardly any homework and i took not one math test. And i took advantage of that and just cheated on my math classes and now i am paying the consequences in college.

So for that reason i am thinking about switching majors to something that requires less math and that has something to do with computers.I am a full time student and i work only 10 hours a week, but now i am just not encouraged to be a full time student, so im thinking about taking 2 classes next semester and being a full time worker.

Not sure if all of this is relevant but here we go:

I graduated high school in the top 20% of my class in 2010. I was accepted to my dream school out of state and parents told me they'd pay for it. College started well, I began in a STEM major, 3.3 GPA for my first year. A week after getting home for summer break, my parents told me they were getting divorced.

Next year, I went back to original school, was having slight difficulty focusing and doing well in advanced level math courses. I thought it was stress. Finished the semester with a 2.8. Spring semester sophomore year I started falling off the wagon. In hindsight, I likely had ""high functioning"" depression. Parents started putting me in the middle of fights (I'm the oldest). Stopped going to class because of stress and lack of doing excellent in subjects I used to breeze through. I wasn't able to work through it. I sought help from the school and got paranoid when I thought I overheard a counselor talking about me in the hallway before our meeting that I was running late for. I dropped all my courses for the semester and went home without any bad grades.

Junior year, everything collapsed. I completely stopped doing anything other than trying to cheer myself up. Things I continued doing: partying, social events. I tried getting a puppy to work on my depression (maybe not the best choice at the time but 4 years later, he's my entire life). A month later, a major storm decimated my hometown and I spent a lot of time worrying about how my family was doing instead of working on class work. I was almost kicked out of my sorority, and I decided halfway through finals week to drop out completely. I was heart broken.

I decided to transfer to a college in my home state and moved in with my grandmother. Things were going exceedingly well. I was working part time, I loved my classes and I was making friends at the school. I finished this semester with a 3.4.

This school had another ""flagship"" college whose program was much better than that other one. I decided to transfer there in order to put myself closer to my goals of getting the best degree I could. I got in to transfer but not for my ideal program. I had balanced working full time with school full time and finished this semester with a 3.2. I figured I was in.

Unfortunately, I was not accepted to the program I wanted. I had needed a 3.5 because I was a ""transfer"" student. I was devastated. A couple weeks later, I was suspended from work due to not getting the required license needed within the allotted time. I was out of work for 6 weeks. During that time, I was too depressed to get out of bed, I felt defeated and stupid.

I asked my family if they would support me taking a year off of school to treat my depression and go back to school having worked on a recovery plan. They all encouraged me to ""just keep going, you're almost done"" because I had been in school for 4 years. I needed about 40 more credits for my major, if I ever got into it.

I tried ""beating the system"" by taking summer courses while I waited to apply again to the major I wanted. This backfired. I could not shake this failure looming over me. I couldn't focus on any work, and when I did, I was so self conscious about it. I thought people would think I was stupid, I'd never graduate and everyone would laugh at me wondering where I went wrong.

I was let go from my job in September right before the semester began. I continued academic year 2014-2015 with the same results. Failure. Depression. Unable to even get out of bed. My GPA dropped down to a 1.5. The grades were either B+ or higher or Fs. I was put on academic suspension.

I had to wait a year before I went back and took courses on a probationary status over the summer of 2016. In the meantime, I worked my butt off at 2 jobs, knowing I'd need to save up money to go back. I applied to every job I could to get closer to an office job in my industry.

I went back super excited. I loved the course I signed up for, I had gotten an entry level position (although temporary) in an office and was applying daily to permanent positions in my industry. I wound up getting a C in the class because it was group focused, and I carried my group the entire course by doing most, if not all, of the work. This was the point that I decided I didn't even like this school. Why did I even care? I didn't meet the criteria for a probationary re-admission after academic probation.

I attempted researching other colleges I could attend instead that were still in the area or online. I found a college that I was very interested in that had my major, and required a 2.0 Cumulative GPA. I guess I only had a 1.8, and I was rejected. My options were to take 4 years off and do an ""academic bankruptcy"" in which I'd have to start over or raise my GPA. I figured it shouldn't be too hard to raise my GPA, so I enrolled in the local community college. Bonus: maybe I could get my A.S. and it would make me more competitive considering I had then completed something.

Fast forward a couple more months, I am currently in an entry level position in financial services with plenty of room to advance. I love my company. They offer $2,500 per year tuition reimbursement. I am taking 2 courses this semester towards an A.S. at a local community college. They want me to retake courses (24 credits more) that I previously took in order to get my degree (for example: English I, Public Speaking, Management, etc.).

Total credits: 83
I think my GPA is around a 1.7 Cumulative

I have some questions:

1.) Is there any way to appeal the transfer evaluation at the community college? I won't get double credit at a 4-yr school for retaking classes o did well in the first time.

2.) Does it make sense to graduate with the Associates before transferring to a Bachelors program? Or should I try to raise my GPA with the couple courses I'd need to take as prerequisites and then try to transfer again?

3.) Is it even possible to raise my GPA that much considering how many courses I have managed to fail?

4.) Should I even bother trying to get my Bachelor's Degree? I have always dreamed of getting a Bachelors and a Masters, but now I'm thinking maybe it's just not worth it/unachievable given my past mistakes.

TLDR; Fucked up in college due to depression, parents' divorce, getting fired and major storm, failed a lot of classes, should I even bother trying to finish?",college,Is getting a Bachelors Degree still possible?

Currently I have a little over a year in a good, entry level job, but I can see that there is much more out there with a degree. 

About 2 years ago I attempted to go to a community college for an Associates, but due to some personal issues my grades rapidly dropped and I was no longer eligible for FAFSA assistance, and did not make enough to cover the cost of classes. 

Now, with my current pay, I make enough to cover these costs, but I work ~45 hours a week, with only Sundays and Mondays off. 

Is it outside the realm of possibility to go to school full time with a student loan to sustain me? I have looked around for answers, but there is so much information around it's hard to get a definite idea of the process of doing so or if it is even possible. 

I understand I could work part time somewhere, and would likely do so, but I guess it gets a little overwhelming trying to get everything mapped out to consider even doing this. 

I have tried online classes in the past, and failed miserably at staying focused. I would much prefer to be in a classroom. 

Any advice would be helpful, thank you.

650,MsCertainlyUncertain,1487995536,/r/college/comments/5w28mw/the_program_i_want_to_be_in_is_very_selective_and/,"Basically, I want to go into graphic design. At my school it is a very selective program. You first have to take 5 required art classes then you take an intro to design class in order to determine candidacy for the program. What that means is that out of 40 students in the class, only 24 are accepted into the program. The selection is based on gpa for art classes (I probably have a 3.6), overall project grades(1. 8/10, 2. 9/10, 3. 9/10. 4. 11.5/15),total gpa must be minimum 2.0(I'm a 2.8), and class attendance (I missed 1 class w/ drs note) Here's my beef; I am technically a Jr. but have changed my major 3 times. First it was art, but I hated it, then it was accounting which was terrible. Now I am completely certain I was to go into graphic design. I believe the class majority is freshmen/sophomores, so I have some seniority.


 I had to get on the waitlist for this class because I decided it was what I wanted at the absolute last minute. I feel like it left a bad impression on my professors because there were miscommunications with emailing one, so I met with her during her office hours and it was awkward. 


I have enjoyed this class so much. It's the first art class I've had where the time flies and I'm having fun. I really do like it. One downfall is that with my last project that we spent 2 weeks on, I scrapped and created a completely different one at the last minute. I was so proud of it and just proud of myself because I underestimated my abilities. Part of our grade involves us printing out the project we created, trimming it to the required size with an xacto knife and then mounting it perfectly straight onto a board. This class has made me so ocd because I want my piece to be perfect. I mounted my project onto the board and it was fine. The night before the due date, I noticed a glue mark, which they take points off for, and tried to remove it with an eraser really hard, causing particles of the board to come off and creating a noticable dent. I so wished I never did that. Then I tried taking the glued project off the board but the middle part was really on there and wouldnt come off. I was forced to glue it back in place, which created a weird texture to the paper and turned it in this way. I was devastated because I was so proud of my project but stupid little things had to make the whole thing trash. I figured that my professors would just focus on the actual work instead of the minor problems but it really hurt my grade because I got an 11.5/15 which is not good because that was the bottom score rank in the entire class. 


I just dont know what to do. I cant go to the professors and ask them to hear me out because this class is competitive and it's on me to prove myself. This was one of the 3 projects I've had and on the others I got the class average grade. We have 3 more projects I believe and I hate that I am putting so much work into something that seems to go unnoticed or that doesn't put my mind at ease. I really need to get into this program and am not sure what else I can do besides what I'm already doing and to also stop obsessing so much over little flaws in my work. 


I can sense who's their favorites are in the class by the way they speak to these people and the way they interact with me when I ask for help seems not completely rude but maybe annoyed or just not as excited. Which is weird because I kind of keep to myself in the class and don't really talk to anyone or participate which may hurt me although participation isn't really a criteria. I have bad anxiety and have a hard time with initiation and just forcing myself to talk too. 
How can I put my mind at ease and maybe make myself stand out more? What am I doing wrong? and how can I make it into this program?


tl;dr: 20/40 students move on to the graphic design program and I'm not sure I will. I just get the vibe my professors don't really like me or what I have to offer even though I'm doing the best I can and really want to be in this program.",college,The program I want to be in is very selective and there's a chance I won't get in.

651,itlk123,1487541881,/r/college/comments/5v0r3h/trouble_making_friends_as_a_transfer_student/,"After a great first year at my original college, I felt that I could do better academically, so I transferred to a larger, elite research university. Since I had no problems making friends at all as a freshman or at any time in my life previously, I thought it would be easy to transfer in socially, but I was gravely mistaken. I have found it incredibly difficult to meet people that I connect with at this school. My current school is a research university with an acceptance rate around 10 percent, and thus I would say about 80 percent of the people here are either very socially awkward or so consumed by their studies that they can barely even squeeze in a social life. My living situation is an 8 person suite consisting of athletes who are never present and STEM students who can barely hold a conversation. My transfer orientation group was a group of music students who had all transferred from the same program at the same school int order to follow a teacher, and thus already knew each other. I tried to join a couple of clubs in the fall but did not realize how insanely competitive the club culture here was. While at most universities, you can join a club by simply emailing the person in charge and expressing interest, joining clubs at my new school only happens during a three week recruiting period at the beginning of the fall, and a smaller number of clubs recruit during a similar period at the beginning of the spring. Many clubs require multiple rounds of interviews during which they cut the majority of applicants, and are very hesitant to take non-freshmen, as they want people who will stay in the club for all four years. Not realizing this, I applied to only a small number of clubs and was ultimately rejected by all of them. The same story happened with greek life, where I came into rush almost completely unknown and had my value reduced by virtue of not being a freshman. I don't really know how to make friends at this point, considering that clubs and greek life are not an option, and my living situation is not at all conducive to meeting people. I honestly feel like I'm trapped at a university that I don't enjoy, and while I know that I am getting an elite education, I can't help but miss my old liberal arts college where I had a sense of community. I feel extremely alone here, which is staring to have impacts on my mental health, and I feel like I have no viable avenues through which to make friends, I can't join a club, I don't meet people in my building, I can't meet friends of friends because that requires having friends in the first place. I've considered transferring again but everyone I have talked to about it says that attending three colleges would raise red flags for future employers, and it would not solve the problem of me not knowing people at my college. I am honestly feeling very lost because I definitely do not want to stay here for two and a half more years, but I have worked way too hard to drop out. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

So i am 22 years old and my name is Jake.  I have been having depression and anxiety and jealousy too. I feel like i have no friends at community. All my cousins and everyone i know including my girlfriend went away to UNI. I feel that i am missing on drinking and partying like my cousins , twin brother , girlfriend and everyone else does in UNI while I'm at Community college after 2 years not drinking and going to frat parties and stuff . My cousins , my girlfriend of 2 1/2 years  , my twin brother goes to UNI  and they make new friends and party too , It's not fair to me and i am jealous of it too. I want to have alot of great friends and  drinking parties  with Frats and soloritys too  at a UNI just like them and have a fun college experience. I feel like giving up ,also i have speech problem too that makes me hard to say some words and sounds so i think most people will not want to be friends because of that too in school too. I have almost no friends at the Community college too . My girlfriend not talking to me after we had a fight is not helping too. If you read my other posts , you can add your advice to your post on this thread too with advice on this thread. Also i didn't get good grades in the last 2 years too especially math too in the last 2 years because i was with my gf and stuff. i feel like giving up at this point , because i figured i will not be like them and have no friends from college and drink and have fun  at parties with friends like them . Everytime i try to work hard , i always fail too so that adds to it so to me hard work does not pay off at all too.

Edit: Also i feel like i will not make any friends and party with at frats and stuff after i transfer out of my Community College too because of my speech problem. Along with that i changed my major at my community college too so i can become Medical doctor too , CRNA or a engineer too , my family says I'm not smart enough because i need help in school and I'm not good in math too . i had 4-8 friends in high school too that i hang out with after in HS. I really never tried in school too so I'm trying to do better too so i can go to a big UNI and drink at frat/ solor parties and stuff like most people do in college

653,JeLev,1485265002,/r/college/comments/5pw4uw/unusually_practical_guide_for_college_xpost_from/,"Hi everyone -- I'm a current college admissions counselor and I posted this on /r/applyingtocollege and was told that this subreddit would probably make use of it as well. So I hope they're right and that this does in some way improve your college life. Because of the nature of that sub it's geared slightly toward newer students, but I'm sure that people currently attending can get something out of it as well.

Here is my ""unusually practical guide for college."" It is arranged in no order at all and was completely improvised this evening. I've been carrying all of this around in my head and wanted to give real, concrete advice, rather than airy, head-space advice (like ""be open-minded!"") We're getting nitty-gritty here. 

Keep in mind that I've only been to one college. I was in English and Political Science. I tried to generalize this, but not everything will apply to every school, and I'm afraid a lot of it is writing-centric. I hope that some other former (or even current) college students can add to this, especially ones with stronger STEM backgrounds. 

And so: 

**Academic**

* While coffee is delicious, tea is better when consumed in mass quantities. If you're studying for finals, your body will feel much better on three cups of tea than it will on three cups of coffee. On that note, learn to eat fruits and vegetables if you don't right now. Your body will thank you. If you have access to unlimited food in the cafeteria, this is your time to try new things. 

* Get to know your faculty advisor quickly. Your school may assign one to you or you may get to pick, but whatever the system is, get on their radar as soon as you can. If they see an opportunity that needs students (research project, internship, whatever) they're more likely to send it to you if they know your name. They will also be better able to advise you if they know more about you.

* When working on group projects, if you're not using Google Drive, you're doing it wrong. Keep everything in there, even things that individual group members are working on and will share with the group later. You never know what can happen and so it's best to keep everything in a common space.

* Get organized. Somehow. I put every assignment and appointment in a Google Calendar and set daily ""to-dos."" Every Friday (or Thursday, because sometimes my weekends started on Thursdays, which was incredible) I created a list of everything I needed to do that weekend, and I stuck to it. Related:

* Use your weekends to your advantage. Things really slow down, so it's a perfect opportunity to jump-start a paper or a reading. 

* You don't have to read every word. Learn to skim. Skim the optional reading too -- it'll come in handy. 

* If you can, take notes on paper, not the computer. When you do this, you mentally siphon out the less important information in favor of the more important information because you can't write as quickly as you can type. This will make your notes more valuable later on.

* Take notes on what you read. Even short summaries like ""Skowroneck considers presidencies as part of long historical periods marked by prevailing ideologies established by certain presidents"" will make your life **much** easier when working on final papers. (Also, y'all should check out Stephen Skowroneck's theory of presidential leadership in political time -- it's fascinating.)

* Use the works cited page of books to your advantage. If you're struggling finding more information on a topic, that's your first port of call. 

* Learn how to write papers in ways that work for you. I always wrote whatever I wanted for the assigned length of the paper. Then I wrote a schematic of what had I puked onto the page, re-organized that schematic into a structure that actually made sense, and fleshed out key details and holes. Some people write a full outline and then start. Some people organize by scholar, case study, source text, or school of thought. Whatever you do, come up with something that works for you. 

* Ask for help. Your professor's office hours, a tutor, the writing center, the counseling center, your classmates. Nobody will think less of you. (Pro-tip: asking classmates for help means talking to the smartest people in your class, which also usually means the most interesting people. Talking to interesting people, I would argue, is the whole point of college.) 

* ""It's hard"" is a TERRIBLE reason to not take a class. The best classes I've taken have also been the hardest classes. ""It's Hard"" is also the name of a pretty bad album by The Who. 

* If you're in a program that lets you be undecided for a year or two, take advantage of that. If you see something that you don't know much about, don't write it off as uninteresting. 

* If you're working on a paper, don't stop your writing session at the end of a paragraph. Start the next paragraph and then stop. This way, when you sit back down to keep going, you don't have to putter about thinking ""how should I start?"" You will already have a beginning. 

* Find a pen you like. Mine is the Bic Grip Roller. I used to go with the Pilot Precise V5 Extra Fine, but they leak sometimes. 

* Balance out your courses. If you have the opportunity to decide which classes you'll take which semesters, plan ahead and avoid loading a lot of hard classes into one semester. 

* If you have a class that only meets once or twice a week, find another time that week that you can treat like that class to do homework only for that class. For example, the year I did a thesis, I dedicated 9-12 every Friday morning to work for that thesis. I did a lot of other work for it throughout the week, but having a dedicated time to work on it really focused me. 

* You can revise your work much more effectively if you put 24 hours between the last time you worked on it and the time you started revising it. 

* Go to campus conversations and events about topics that are outside your subject area. Just because you're not studying it doesn't mean you shouldn't learn about it. This is the one time in your life where you will have the benefit of professors lecturing for free right outside your door. (Also, these events tend to have free food.)

* Keep a novel going to read for fun. I would start all of my library sessions just by reading a little bit for my own enjoyment. The idea was to get my brain going with a warm-up before I jumped into the work I would get graded on. Crosswords, Sudoku, and Chess are good alternatives to this if you're not much of a reader. 

* Find a hobby. It's really important to be able to do something that is productive but not academic. You won't feel bad about working on this thing, because it's productive, but you simply can't spend all of your time on your studies. I played a lot of music, but I know people who tried woodworking, knitting, yoga, improv comedy, and one guy with a unicycle. 

* Purchase a copy of *The Elements of Style*. Read it once at the beginning of each semester. If you carry it with you everywhere, you're not over-doing it.

**Social**

* Learn to make one large, shareable dish like a dip, lasagna, cake, or bowl of chili. There are a lot of pot lucks in college, and you will be well-prepared if you have a dish like this on standby. PM me for a bean dip recipe that people actually request of me when I go to stuff at their houses. 

* Go to parties with people you know. Make sure that you keep track of them and they keep track of you (and that you keep track of them) throughout the night. Walk each other home. 

* When considering campus opportunities, it easier to say yes and then say no than it is to say no and then yes. You can always try something once (a sport, a club, whatever) and then say ""you know, this isn't for me"" if it isn't for you. It's much harder to jump on things once they've started. 

* If you're at a party, never leave a drink unattended. Ever. 

* Set aside structured time to see the friends who mean the most to you. This can be an orientation group, people from your floor, whatever. College gets busy, and so ritualizing friendship makes it A) more frequent and B) more special, somehow. I know people who had ""family dinner"" with their closest friends every Sunday, and nothing got in the way. 

* You are not bound to your friends, especially the ones you make early on. I ditched my first-semester friends in January of my freshman year and it was one of the best choices I've ever made. They weren't bad people; we just had nothing in common. Don't be afraid to branch out.

* Branching out is scary and that's okay. 

* Do not judge anyone's character or personality (unless they do something very heinous) during their first semester. Everyone in the first semester is very desperate to be liked, and people tend not to do their best when they're under that kind of pressure. Let people (and yourself) mellow out a little bit before you start deciding who you like. This advice goes doubly for sophomores, juniors, and seniors who are passing judgment on incoming first-year students. 

* Find someone who you're close to who does not go to your school who you can call if you just need to vent. 

* Don't get that upset when most of your high school friendships collapse. It just happens.

* Give people room to change and become better people. College has a way of knocking people down a peg. If you meet someone who looks like they need that, check back on them in a year or two. 

* Take your work seriously, but don't take yourself seriously. Otherwise, you'll end up like one of the people in the above tip.

* Being a campus celebrity is not that fun. It's better to just know a lot of people so you have a lot of friendly faces on campus that you can say hi to than it is to just be ""known."" It's also okay to just have a small group of people who you like. 

* Meet older students. It doesn't matter if you do it through clubs or sports teams or greek communities, but these people have all the key info on your school, like which classes and professors are good, where to go for really good Vietnamese food, and which improv groups to see. They will also invite you to the cooler parties. 

* If you're unhappy, make a change. Cut or change an extracurricular, start hanging out with different people, break up with that person. Just don't make changes indiscriminately -- try to find the root of your dissatisfaction and fix that.

However school got really expensive and I wasn't able to finish on time (the tuition was over $50k and I didn't have enough scholarships). So I decided to come back and try city college for a while...my dad ended up passing away a few months after I came back from school and while I tried going to city college for three semesters total, I maybe finished like 2 classes. I was more interested in working, to be honest, and it was hard for me to concentrate in school.

Basically I have a 1.38 from that school and am on probation so I've really shot myself in the foot. I'm getting to the point where I am thinking of actually applying to a school and finishing my bachelor's (since I have like 70 credits from my first university), but I'm scared that I've dropped/failed so many classes during the last several years that I won't get into a college. I want to omit my city college history, but if I apply to a state school they'll have to see it.

I worked my ass off to get accepted there, and I absolutely love it (even though it's very challenging and stressful at times). I get stressed/anxious very easily, it's just part of my character, but lately, being a commenter student (and having a very strict mom) has been a bigger challenge than I anticipated. 

My dad is not the problem - he's a chill guy, but my mom is a whole other story. Growing up, I was very isolated from other kids my age. I wasn't allowed to have friends over, hang out with them outside of school, go to school dances/events (not even prom), I wasn't allowed to play sports or join many after school/extracurricular activities, blah blah you get the idea. Don't get me wrong, I love my mom, and she loves me, but she is way too overprotective of me. 

Everyday, I wake up about 3 hours earlier compared to my peers just to get to school on time. Traffic is terrible where I live, and my college is a good 16 miles away from my house, and since I don't have a car, my mom drops me off/picks me up EVERY DAY. I try not to get embarrassed about it, but it's really hard not to be humiliated every time my mom drops me off by the front steps of my building in her minivan in front of dozens of fellow college students. 

In total, we probably do about 3 hours of driving everyday (to school and back). This quarter, my classes get off pretty late and I have so much homework and studying to do and I'm constantly tired since I sleep so late. I try to see the positives of living at home, like sleeping in my own bed and having my own bathroom, but that's pretty much it. The time wasted in car rides could be of so much use to me, and I'll be getting more sleep and I can participate in clubs and sports like I've always wanted, but my mom just won't let me do anything. I've actually talked to her about this stuff but she just doesn't get it. She just dismisses me and calls me dumb or ridiculous for wanting to dorm at college when ""I have a perfectly good bed at home."" She thinks going to campus events is unnecessary and bad people would want to do bad things to me, and she's always acted this way, even with my older sisters (who are both in their thirties and still live at home even though they have good jobs because my mom never have them independence). 

I've been so obedient towards my mom for so long, because I know that whatever I do/say, she'll always reject my ideas if it involves me getting even the tiniest bit of independence. I've asked her so many times if I could hang out with friends or get a job or go to a campus event and every time she's said no. If I disobey her, she will make my life miserable. She'll slap the living daylight out of me and take away my phone, laptop, and pretty much every other form of communication to the outside world (And please don't say ""slapping you is abuse, call the cops on your mom."" because that's going to make things worse). Friends tell me to speak up for myself, that I'm an adult, but *they just don't get it*. I've tried *everything* to get my mom to let me dorm. She's been saying for months now that she'll get me a car, but I've crunched the numbers and her getting me a car, insurance, maintenance parking permits, and gas would cost more than just letting me dorm for the next two academic years (I'm graduating early). I've been given so much in scholarships/grants/aid that it just doesn't make any financial sense to commute, but my mom says she doesn't care, that she needs to keep an eye on me until I'm out of the house. I'm a very responsible person. I've never caused trouble in my entire life. I do great in school. I don't party or do drugs or anything like that. The worse thing I've done is keep my room messy. 

I just don't get it, and I'm at my wits end with my mom. School is only going to get harder next year, and I just don't have the time or energy to drive 3 hours a day and deal with my overbearing family. I don't have anyone to talk to that'll understand my situation. Whenever I voice my concerns, my older sisters tell me to get over myself and to stop being immature and to just deal with our mom whether I like it or not. I want to get an internship at my university, but it's just not realistic with my mom because she demands that I print out my schedule for her to see and she expects me to be out and done with school  after my last class of the day. I feel like I'm stuck and going nowhere. And people tell me ""oh, you just need to get control of your own life, you're an adult. Stop being such a pushover,"" but what the hell am I supposed to to in this situation? Risk my relationship with my mom/family and make her even more controlling of me? Everyone seems to judge me for being so obedient but they never offer suggestions of what I can do to better my situation. I could use some advice or encouragement on what to do. I feel like my mom is holding me back from accomplishing so many things in life, but I just don't know how to make her stop this.

Currently I'm a biology major but I wanted to be a neuroscience major,  however my school doesn't offer neuroscience and I was going to transfer to another school that did. Before college i was really good at biology and chemistry  in high school and really got into studying the brain because of my AP Psychology teacher.  But as being a biology major I realized I truly don't enjoy science as much as I used go and I'm only continuing this course because my school advisor pretty much told me it is too late for me to do anything else and it would be hard to graduate in time. I would have changed it sooner but I got all of my non-stem electives out of the way first.

Mostly this fall 2016 semester kicked my ass because my chemistry 2 and biology classes were my most difficult classes. Everyone found it easy while I struggled to find it interesting and learning so much information for a cumulative final at the end. I wanted to change my major to English but I truly suck at writing. And everything else doesn't interest me. I've tried taking classes outside of my major but nothing clicked.

659,le_danse_macabre,1482299468,/r/college/comments/5jia13/from_2167_to_38_in_one_semester/,"***Disclaimer*** - I had only attempted 12 credits at my college prior to this semester so that is why I was able to make such a HUGE jump. Once you have a ton of credits factored in, it's harder to make big jumps.

****

My previous grades were A, B, F, and P (pass, no grade points). This semester I retook the F class and got an A, plus three other A's to boot. I got a 4.0 for the semester, made the Vice President's List, and raised my GPA by 1.633 points!

Although my disclaimer should make it clear that this kind of GPA magic can't work for everyone, **the MOST important thing you can do for your GPA is to retake classes you got a D or F in**, provided your school allows you to replace the previous grade for GPA purposes. 

****

The most important thing I did to get a 4.0 this semester was to build momentum early and maintain that momentum when the boring middle of the semester part begins. Do not skip class, do not skip homework, do not just say, ""Well the lowest one gets dropped,"" or ""I'll bring my grade back up on the next test."" You need to build a cushion and safety net for the times later on when you are not motivated. 

Example: The last week of school I was still struggling with a presentation for biology lab I'd been working on for 2 weeks. I picked a shitty topic and although I'd tried to refine and change it I just could not get together a presentation I wouldn't feel embarrassed presenting. I had horrible anxiety about it, and I ended up skipping the whole thing. (Not my best moment. Dick move.) However, because I had done *literally everything else to the best of my ability,* getting a zero on that one final prez took my overall grade in Bio from 99.2 to 93.5. I slept great that night knowing I had worked hard enough the rest of the semester that this one curveball of a crappy project had no power over my grade.

That's the general idea. Don't put yourself in the situation where you absolutely must score a 95 on the cumulative final to get a C. Aim to put yourself in the situation where you could score a 50 on the final and still get a B. Be diligent about the little stuff. It pays off!

2. Do assigned reading the night before and take notes for extra background knowledge.
3. Study in the library (can't focus at home).
4. Do assignments first then play Skyrim.
5. Learn outside of school.
6. Join a club relevant to major (CS club)
7. Speak with counselor first before signing up for classes.
8. Consume nothing that will impair my body or future career.
9. Get an internship the summers before Junior and Senior year
10. Sleep is more important than anything.
11. Read the syllabus like a bible (then input everything in Google Calendar)

I've been practicing with this a few key notes before I head off into the lion's den.

I'm astonished people consider 9 am classes 'early' :/

Obviously I don't really care I'm this young nor do other people. Nothing to brag about. I didn't graduate with a diploma because I was in all honors class or something. I felt held back and confined to a cage with no way to escape nor any freedom. I'm not missing anything from leaving early, being an introvert with moderate social anxiety saw to that.

What else do I need to know? I feel like I can read all the blogs in the world and still be missing something.

Long story short, I'm a post-bac student who was trying to use this semester to raise my science GPA from ~2.9 to at least a 3.0. I have a perfectly fine 3.5 cumulative GPA because I did well in my Psych minor. Unfortunately, because I was adjusting to a new school that was different from my undergrad one, took on more than I could handle, had a terrible schedule where I was on campus early every day and staying late, being constantly tired due to mild anemia and said schedule, I'm performing terribly. I lost my chances of getting A’s after the first round of midterms and tried to change my study approach to do better on my second round of midterms, but I only improved in one of my classes. I am worried this basically ruins my chances of even going for the lowest-tier grad schools. I've asked advice on how to study before when I was struggling with midterms, and while it worked really well for my anatomy class (where the slides are basically 90% words and I can learn by rewriting the notes), my other classes, such as Molecular Bio mostly have pictures that I have to work to interpret myself or find the information in the textbook and thus was a lot harder to execute. I honestly think when it comes to Molecular Bio, I have had to work three times as harder as my peers to “get’ my professor's slides because he doesn’t teach it in a linear fashion I prefer and jumps all over the place.

I'm frustrated because I feel if I had honestly NOT taken this gap year, I could've saved my GPA and my chances of graduate school because I was so borderline for that 3.0 many schools suggest. I'm also angry at myself because I wish I had actually worked harder when I had the classes during undergrad because at least I wouldn’t feel so alone AND struggling in academics at this new school. However, this semester has made me wonder if all this time, I am actually not cut out for Biology. I do well in my Anatomy classes and have lab experience from two different places at my old university, but I clearly struggle in anything Cell or Molecular Biology related, and have had to retake more than 4 courses before. I was never good at math and logical things in high school, but after one of my science teachers worked hard to make Biology fun to learn, I got interested in it, which is why I did well in my intro to Bio classes in the first place.

To be honest, I'm burnt out as hell, miserable, depressed nothing has gone well for me, and I have to work hard this final week of school if don't want straight D's on my transcript. I'm scared of telling my parents 5+ years of Biology studying went down the drain and I’m wondering if this is the breaking point where I should give up and find something else to do. Finals are next week, and I'm cracking from the pressure that I have to do extremely well just to save my grade to a C or low B. I used to enjoy Biology, even though it was difficult, but now the stress is making me consider other fields since I’m extremely limited in my opportunities if I don’t go to grad school. However, most of my other interests are in arts and liberal arts and psych, so I'm not even sure if going for a second degree will be worth it. 

I’m sorry if this was kind of ranty and sad. I also tried attending a lab interview earlier today so I could be a lab tech for research I was interested in working with but apparently they filled all the slots before they could interview me and this other girl in my class, so I’m having a terrible day.

I felt as though all of my education set me up to be where I need to be. However, I have had a friend for around five years now and he is finally deciding he wants to go to school. The problem here is that he received a very poor education, never tried, and was never put into any college prep courses. He spent a semester taking two or three classes right after graduating high school, but it was too hard for him. He recently asked me what he could do to prepare himself over the next six months before attempting to reengage in school.

My advice was to start with the basics, as those were hard for him but they are necessary as they might relate to his prereqs. So the basics I recommended were: 
-algebra
-an introductory science (chemistry or biology)
-brush up on reading comprehension
-Learn how to write a paper
-learn how to cite sources

I sent him to websites such as PurdueOwl for citations, and Khan Academy for, well, mostly everything else. However, I do not feel as though a lot of this information has helped him. navigating the internet until I find something I understand is not daunting for me, but for him it is. 

So, my questions are: 

-What other basics would be good to prepare for college (whether it's in hindsight or something an academic adviser recommends/ed)?
-What are some online resources that one can utilize to brush up on these skills?

I'm very stressed out because not only are all my lecture final exams cumulative this semester, something that didn't happen often during my actual undergrad time, the final worth more than a midterm grade and are the kind of exams where you have to infer the answer based on what you studied. Basically I believe they are conceptually based and will ask you ""if x happened what happens to the mitochondria"" instead of ""what does the mitochondria do?"" 

Doing well on the final can seriously save or destroy my GPA at the moment, as my original goal was to raise my science 2.98 to at least a 3.0 for grad programs (and to save my GPA from a bad semester I had junior year) but I'm terrified this semester will make my transcript look worse and it's too late to drop. I feel as if I am too used to memorizing from my Anatomy classes and not being a great critical thinker because I keep having difficulty figuring out how to improve.

I have indeed tried office hours for professors but I'm starting to hate going as I always have the impression that compared to the questions other students have asked when I went, I'm asking them stuff that should've been easy or I'm wasting their time because despite that I'm willing to work hard I'm not that bright of a pupil. And this is not even a top 100 school, this is just my regular public state college.

Take my last Molecular Bio exam for example. I tried to not cram compared to the first exam and studied 2 hrs during lunch before each lecture reading parts of the book and writing notes on confusing parts. I even studied with a group, tested my ability to recall without the notes, and thought I was going to do better this second exam.... then I got the exam in front of me and felt like everything on there was nothing I studied on at all because they were all questions you had to infer the answer to. Additionally I had another Cell Bio class where I was told by many students that all you have to do is read the professor's lectures, write down anything he puts on the board and you can get an A. And guess who still did poorly on exams despite this advice from students?

I'm really depressed that I blew my chances of getting mostly As this semester and I already feel burnt out and want to drop out of school because I'm stressed that this keeps happening to me. I do really well in my Anatomy, Psych and beginning Bio courses which is why my overall GPA is higher than a 3.3 but once molecular subjects happened I was dumb to think I could master them if I tried hard enough.

This is mostly the fault of the family I was born into and the family I was brought up in and how both were extremely parts of my life that I was forced to live in.

I grew up in a large suburban town (population 250,000+) and my early years of schooling were great. I was a straight A student throughout all of elementary and middle school. I excelled in the advanced programs I had been put into and was very good at basketball and most sports as I was a natural at all of them.

High school was where it all ultimately changed for the worse despite my efforts to continue to be a contributing factor to society. When I was least expecting my academic career (the only career I had anymore) to go downhill, it did, and it wasn't even my fault. I continued to take advanced classes by enrolling in many AP courses in high school, most of which I did well in and passed the exams, saving myself about a year in time and money of college coursework. However, I could have certainly done better if it were not for my extremely detrimental domestic situation. To put a long story short, my father ""cheated"" on my mom for about 9 months before she found out. Once she found out, it was around the beginning of my sophomore year. Since that period, there were non-stop arguments, fights, and bickering between the 2 of them. This went on for about 2 years (so from early sophomore year to early senior year) and has since come to a halt for all intensive purposes. To be honest with you, I truly do not know whether or not my father cheated but at the end of the day, I say that his actions (infidel or not) had crippling detrimental effects on myself that I still live with.

Since this whole domestic instability, I have never been the same and I do not ever think I will be the same. I retracted involvement in sports partially due to not having my parents afford a car for me and because I no longer had the natural athletic build that I had in my childhood; instead, I was extremely skinny and I tried working out to an appropriate extent for my age but I never got back to where I should have been. My mother and father continued to be overprotective of me and refused to allow me to participate in contact sports, so I couldn't play football for example. As for my academics, it was so hard to stay focused but I did my best which was ok. I had no problem getting into any university that I applied to and received admission offers and scholarships from all but one. However, the scholarships I received were all partial and I was unable to afford the difference, so I was forced to stay in-state and I decided to go to a school about 3 hours away from home.

Life away from home has been very difficult for me. I don't know anybody here and I really don't even want to put myself out there because of my depressing and lonely personality. I don't have any family anywhere away from home because everyone on my mom's side died and we don't talk to anyone on my dad's side (they live in another country anyways). Life away from home is also more expensive than I expected it to be in both money and time costs. Therefore, I applied to another in-state institution that is commutable from my original home and I intend on going there for the remaining years of my study.

My domestic/home life has really crippled me and it's hard to talk about because I think a lot of people will think I am making it out to be worse than it is or because nobody else seems to have any of these issues. I was pretty much an oddball at my high school because I didn't do any sports for reasons previously explained, I was involved in extracurriculuar activities that were underfunded and unappreciated at my school, and I really didn't have many friends. I wasn't really into having too much fun either because... life wasn't very fun for me anymore.

It makes me feel so worthless that I was such a top notch student in almost all aspects and to think that my father (who had virtually no involvement in my education other than me giving him my report cards when the time came around) would think to do this. **It just sucks.** And I cannot put it any other way. **It makes me feel worthless.** To a point where I just stopped doing my best in some classes back in high school at times. *I could NOT cope anymore.* It was too much to say ""get over it"" and move on that fast because I had worked so hard from a little child being promised such great rewards and this is what I get... lovely. I no longer could take the curriculum in AP English because every book we read during the school year was about cheating, infidelity, or extramarital affairs. **I kid you NOT.** I couldn't do Calc BC anymore because I just counldn't find the environment or the motivation in myself anymore to study. And it felt so bad getting F's on every exam for something that wasn't all my fault. AP Chemistry and AP Physics weren't any better! I had tried so hard and this whole family corruption never went away in my mind despite all my attempts to set myself free.

I have been doing pretty good in college, mostly because I am not pursuing a STEM degree like I guess I originally intended to. I am studying Radio/TV with hopes of one day being a successful sports commentator or a political commentator.

I'm making the decision to go to school back home next year simply because I cannot afford to live away from home after this year and I think there are better opportunities in broadcasting back home where I come from. I will buy a car so that I can escape my house.

What made me write this is that I've missed class the past 2 days and it wasn't anything mandatory/important. However, these were the last classes before my exams in each class for next week. I was very depressed after having some betrayal and racist comments directed towards me by some friends. I stayed up very late on Wednesday night and missed class by about an hour on Thursday morning. However, Thursday night was a very depressing night for me as its my parents anniversary which is trash now obviously. They still celebrate it but it haunts me bad. I went to sleep at about 3 AM, woke up around 12:00 PM (20 minutes into my only class of the day) then went back to sleep **until 5 PM!!!!** I was so depressed and sleep to me is where everything goes away.

I wish I got out more, but to be honest, I hate alcohol, drugs, and partying because I just never have done it as I've never had a real group of people to call friends. Whenever I think about doing something outside my dorm, I just pull a typical chickening out and then continue to play video games for the next few hours because its free. I'd like to think that this is just a matter of not having enough to do that interests me. I truly wish I was working already and was doing something I was passionate about. Then, I'd think everything else would come naturally and maybe I could escape this dark, dark place I am in.

Now, in college I have to use active studying and that really burns me out. Ever since junior year of high school and the stress of having to prepare for standarized tests and college admissions, I haven't been able to exercise as none of my friends did it anymore and I couldn't find time. 

I found that whenever I exercised , my grades would suffer, and vice-versa, and I couldn't find the strength to exercise after exhausting myself from studying.

In college I'm learning so many new things which take a lot of time to process and it's alreadying tiring enough to learn subjects that I never dealt with as deeply in high school that if I tried to exercise, I would end up not getting all my homework done.

I'm not going to get smarter, but I think getting stronger is possible.

The problem, is, how do I find time to exercise when I'm exhausted from the little sleep I get? 

I could pick a easy major and I wouldn't really learn much from it but I would have time to exercise but I want to figure out how to find a hard major and also find time to exercise.

I'm a biology major who was a pre-med initially for my parents but at a certain point my hate for biology outweighed my fear to confront them. I decided to finish my biology degree because I'm almost done and do a masters in Biomedical Engineering because thats what i always wanted to do and i love math/coding. I have two problems, one immediate and one long term

The past winter semester i took 3 bios and got C's in all of them. The summer i tried taking a bio and a math i need for BME and i failed both. Now we get to this semester.

I took two bio's and the same math. Dropped one bio in the first week. I missed the first math exam which i thought was fine but then i looked at my syllabus and realized i didn't have a drop so if my professor didn't give me a break i was going to fail the class so i decided to start catching up in the class first then i'd go talk to the professor. But catching up took longer than i thought because i also had to catch up with the other bio class which the first exam i bombed. 

So i didn't talk to the professor and i didn't do my homework or quizzes which are 20% of my grade (but i can still salvage at least 10% with the rest of the assignments of the semester). 

Now for this bio class. So including this class, i have 5 bio classes left to graduate, about 18 credits. I've attended zero of my workshop classes, losing 60 points out of 150, and i need 90 points in the workshop to pass the class regardless of my grades in the rest of it. I have an exam today that i'm really ill prepared for and my drop was already used on my first exam. 405/570 points is failing in the class, and i have only 485/570 points (between a final report, quizzes, 2 exams, and a final) left for me to obtain. Even if i got all those points though, if i get less than 90 in the workshop (which im literally at 90 rn) i fail the whole class.

I feel like there's hope for the math class if i just talk to the professor, but i don't know what to do about the bio class. Should i just withdraw and try to fix my garbage study habits? I'm paying for about $4500 of the semester out of pocket. I already threw away some of that money by dropping the first bio. 

****So that's the immediate issue.**** 

   The bigger problem is that this has been a trend over the last 4 semesters. This is the first semester where it got this bad. But last few semesters i've been dropping classes here and there. Doing poorly. Passing just barely. And every semester i tell myself i'm going to go to class. I'm going to attend. But i just don't. I might attend class for a week then i'll flake for another like 3 weeks. I don't know what's wrong with me. I'll miss one class. Then i'll say ok i just need to catch up on that class. I'll go to study and i cannot focus i can't keep my mind on task. 

With my calc class it was easier to study because i love math, but getting behind in bio took me away from it. With my bio classes i literally have to force myself to look at the page. Like i have to consciously in my mind tell myself ""Look at the page, look at the page, dont stop reading."" If i stop telling myself to focus i'll wander off and get distracted. And just getting myself to focus is a fight it's like i'm battling with myself to just study. I tried pomorodo method before and that will work for a few days but then i go back to my normal cycle. Part of the issue is that i've struggled with depression and anxiety over the last two years. Recently the depression is slowly fading but the anxiety is still there and its caused by my doing poorly in school and spending even longer in university because i keep dropping classes. My anxiety causes me to not want to do anything but its caused by my not doing anything:(

I feel my biggest issue with this is simply that i don't go to class. I've always been one of those idiot ""smart but lazy"" kids, which i know sounds very childish and means nothing.  However if i sit in class and focus i usually don't have to study much outside of class. I can understand and absorb most information just from taking good notes in class and paying attention, with exceptions of course. My problem is every single semester i start off strong and almost immediately like 1 or 2 weeks in the semester i fall behind in all my classes. And the game of catch up always snowballs out of control until im right here 2/3 into the semester failing my classes anxiety levels through the roof.

Like right now, i know what i need to do to do well. I'm very motivated to finding solutions and i'll probably work really hard at the moment. But once next semester hits i'm scared:(. I feel so hopeless. I've been doing the same song and dance for the past 2 years nothing has changed. What gets me even more angry is that i have a job that requires me to be learning and growing and gaining new skills and i'm doing phenomenal in that job. I honestly thought i was stupid and worthless because of my classes. But here in this job i'm excelling unbelievably. I keep telling myself that it's just because im doing biology which i hate with every fiber of my life. But even so i still have 18 credits of bio classes i have to grind through, i need a solution.

**TL;DR I'm a very bad student currently failing his classes. I need help figuring out what to do about these classes but on a larger scale figuring out how to break out of this cycle of regret, resolution, hard work for two weeks, flake for 3 weeks, cram and try to catch up, then regret again. My biggest issues are not going to class and not being able to focus when i need to study**

edit: also i have a lot of college credits because i went to a crappy religious private school that graduated me at 16 and sent my to a community college where i basically had to finish up the rest of my education then transfer to university. In the process i took a lot of classes i didn't need and had to take a lot of classes just to finish the pre-reqs to start working on actual degree classes.

My teacher has a really, really heavy accent. So heavy that I struggle to understand anything he says. The first ten minutes of class I try an focus as hard as I can, but inevitably I lose focus. I've tried everything to stay focused. Left my laptop and phone at home, sat in the front of class, gone to office hours etc. I just can't do it. He also uses a syllabus that was made in the 90's with no exact dates for papers and tests. If you ask about papers and tests in class he laughs and says ""we'll talk about it later"". He assigns chapters each day in class, forgets what he assigned, and asks us the next class what the readings were. In office hours when I ask about the reading he just says ""what were they?"". It's my only class on Monday and Wednesday, and in all honesty it feels like a waste of time to go. I attend a commuter school. It's 1.5 hours to get to this class and 1.5 to get home. My entire day is shot because of this and it's really frustrating to go out to school just to sit mindlessly for two hours. My motivation to attend is shrinking and I need suggestions on how to make this easier on myself. I'm a 4.0 student currently and have never had real issues with motivation or attending a class, until now.

The main issues are;
1.) I'm graduating this semester and need this class. Dropping is not an option.
2.) I attend a commuter school, 1.5 hours to get there, 1.5 to get home. Day feels wasted.
3.) Unsure of dates, readings and deadlines even with office hours.

TL;DR: My professors accent is too heavy to understand. It's a 3 hour total commute for one class. Don't know what work is required of us or when it's due, even if I go to office hours. Need advice.


Edit: here's a link to his syllabus. The dates on it are in June for the fall semester. And the weeks things are ""due"" don't line up. (One of them is Fall recess)

Edit 2: Update - today's class, he walked into the class. Started a movie, left and never came back leaving the entire class bewildered. We are going as a group to report him to the dean. This is unacceptable.

I know I need to most definitely communicate with her, I just need to work it up to her, but I've loved all of the suggestions I've gotten! And again, I want to make it clear: my concerns are not only for my own sake, but I'm concerned about her OWN well being. I hate seeing people struggle! 


I'm a second year college student and last year I didn't (necessarily) have a roommate, so roommate issues are new to me. So I have this roommate - Lisa* - who seems to have some sort of disability. I'm not one to judge or anything (I have a learning disability myself). She's fairly nice and she just seems very shy/awkward and like she doesn't necessarily know social cues well. Okay, no big deal!

I moved in first and my room had no odor to it. It was a little musty from the summer, but after opening the windows and turning on my wax melter it was fine. So she moved in a few days later and immediately turned my wax melter off (without asking, I had been out of the room visiting my boyfriend). She told me the smell overwhelmed her and she told me not to have it on when she's in the room. Okay, seemed odd but I dealt with it.

Right away, I noticed she's NEVER brushed her teeth. Ever. Since getting here and we've been here a month. Typically she was showering every other day but I never saw her bring any soap or shampoo to the shower. Just a towel and a robe. 

The smell began to build up after she moved in. 

I've tried to deal with it and ignore it, because I know often people can't control what environment they're from and what have you. But it's not her stuff that smells. It's here. The smell gets worse when she's in the room. Like today I heard her getting dressed and the odor wafted across the room and over to where I was sitting on my bed. Somebody's body odor SHOULDN'T be that bad. 

This week, I haven't been in my room much, but in the mornings I haven't seen her once go to the shower. 

I know Lisa is slow because you can tell by talking to her and noticing the way she acts. I think she needs somebody to say to her ""hey Lisa, you need to take a shower; put on clean clothes; pick up your side of the room, etc."" 

I'm too afraid to talk to her as not only is she suffering from a disability, but I think she has emotional problems as well (she posts stuff about being lonely on Facebook and being unable to cry). But she's said before she's enjoying life???

I talked to my RA and a friend of mine who is an RA. Basically, my RA said to live with my window cracked slightly open (Yeah, I tried that and my roommate shut my window) or to talk to her about it, and I do not feel comfortable talking to her about it because of what I've listed above. 

It's gotten to the point where I will (pretty much) not live in my room. It's disgusting and unacceptable. She's in her early to mid twenties too (she went to school later because she had troubles adjusting to adulthood) and I feel at this point, she should know better, or know that if she has allergies to soaps and shampoos to try and get something medicated. She has a work study job, so there's literally no excuse for her to not have money for personal care items. Even something from the dollar store could help!

What do I do in a situation like this? I thought about taking it a step above my RA and speaking to the director of our building. I don't do it to be rude or a dick - I do it because I'm genuinely concerned for her - I feel bad for her, if she needs help like that. I even told my RA I believe she has a hard time living independently and she just shrugged it off. I KNOW they CAN'T force her to shower, but can't they try to find some support to help her?

The smell is starting to go out into the hallway.

tldr; My roommate smells disgusting and it makes me not want to be in my room. I believe she has some sort of disability and she's not emotionally stable, judging from Facebook posts.

673,_coffeeblack_,1475477536,/r/college/comments/55migm/my_undergraduate_degree_isnt_going_to_get_me_very/,"Hello friends,

I am on my way to earning my undergraduate degree- a Bachelor of Arts in German Language and Literature.

At the risk of sounding presumptions: yes, I am aware this was not the most economical choice. I will say, however, I have found the skills and techniques that my academic path has taught me to be priceless.

As you can imagine, a four year degree in a foreign language does not necessarily open a wide variety of doors- and I am looking into pursuing a master's degree right out of college in order to make myself more marketable. My GPA is around a 3.5, but all the classes required for my major have been solid A's my entire time at university. I am a hard worker, and self motivated.
.




My current ideas are as followed:

A MA in Teaching English as a Second Language. The university I am current attending offers a graduate program- that coincidentally demands an undergraduate degree in a foreign language. At a first glance, this seems to be the next logical step.
.


The sad truth is that my German skills will most likely never be refined enough to compete with a native German speaking person. This holds true, in my mind, for nearly every single career possibility. The Teaching English as a Second Language (TESL) degree incorporates my enjoyment for cultural studies, language, and helping others.

I understand I could teach at a high school level, but this interests me very little.
.


My other idea is Experiential Education. I got this idea from a good friend who is currently working on this himself. In an overview, experiential education is ""...a philosophy of education that describes the process that occurs between a teacher and student that infuses direct experience with the learning environment and content""
.


A practical application of this is therapy- using a unique holistic approach of exercise, a strong sense of insight, and a connection to natural roots to work through problems. This, for the same reasons as TESL, appeals to me because it involves an appreciation for humanities as well as giving a helping hand to those who need it.
.


Really, I am asking for advice for ANY masters degree. These are two paths I have found that sound appealing to me. Anything you may know of that I haven't had the pleasure of stumbling across, please let me know.
.


Some more background about me:

I lived in Brazil for a year. I went there with no Portuguese background and came back ""conversationally fluent."" I know what it is like to arrive in a foreign land, and to both not understand the language, but the culture behind a new place. I thought this experience would be helpful for teaching English to non-native speakers. It's more than just words, but the subtle differences between them, and how some things are acceptable other places and unacceptable other places.
.


I am applying to live in Germany for the 2017-2018 school year. This is the terminal year of my undergraduate, and it would help immensely with my German Language and Literature background, as well as give me more insight into how different cultures operate.
.


This might seem a little over-the-top, but I think it is worth mentioning. I have had a fairly turbulent upbringing. My parents were 16 when they had me, I was raised by a single mother in poverty. (My parents eventually ended up getting back together.) We spent time being homeless, living off the food shelf, etc., etc. I grew up with very poor mental health, in and out of psychologists / therapists, and struggled throughout my adolescence with being a stable individual.
.


I really think this background gives me a significant intuition for troubled youth. I would enjoy working with young, albeit tormented or ""hopeless,"" people. In my experience, it was the integrated / holistic exercises that helped me the most with working through my own problems. I found being outside, discussion, and feeling a sense of connectedness with my environment were much more crucial to happiness than any sort of serotonin stabilizer or anti-depressant. I fully believe these medications have a useful purpose, and I don't mean to argue against them. The results of my therapy are purely anecdotal.
.


This might be a cliche of naive youth, but I have never been one to worry over having a lot of money. I understood going into my undergraduate degree in a niche sub-group of humanities that I wouldn't be generating a lot of income. My parents both have some strong dissatisfaction with their careers and spent a lot of time telling me to do what I love. I would like to find myself making more than 40k a year, and other than that salary is not a huge deal breaker for me.
.


I am willing to travel. I'll hopefully be living in Europe for the better part of a year, and I have already lived in South America (though it was mainly Brazil, with some touring.) I would be up to moving internally within the US (currently in Minnesota,) or internationally to pursue a career. I do not own a lot of things, packing up and moving would require minimal effort outside of paperwork / regulations.
.


If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time from your day to take a loot at my ramblings. As a side not, hopefully the spacing doesn't bother you. I tried to break it up and make it manageable. Please, let me know what you think. I am very interested in having as many different perspectives on this issue as possible.

674,ThePaulitician,1472744092,/r/college/comments/50ns4b/please_help_transfer_process/,"I am strongly inclined to transfer immediately after this semester to a school back home.

I am a native of South Florida and I attended the summer semester at Univ. Of Central Florida (UCF) and am currently attending the fall semester here as well.

My situation for going to college was largely based off the fact that I had a lot of AP Credits. I took 15 AP Classes in high school and passed all of the exams except for 2.

I originally intended on majoring in engineering but switched to Radio/TV on the first day of summer classes. I had taken AP Chemistry, Physics 2 and Physics C: Mechanics in High school and only passed the Physics C: Mec exam. I had decided that at the end of the day, the teachers can only teach so much in an engineering/science setting. Every one of these AP Sciences I took always had a first-year teacher or a teacher who was a rookie to the class. Now, they were smart and knew the material, they just struggled teaching it as it was very difficult material. And it would ultimately be up to me to teach myself and try to get help. I tried to get help, but then realized it was *just not possible* for a student like myself. I really had never seen such challenging, unfamiliar material to the point where I didn't even know where to begin some problems. So I decided to switch to Radio/TV because I am good at public speaking and already have some advantages with YouTube and connections to current students that are also communication majors (these students are not students at UCF though).

The summer was a questionable experience, but it was easy and I got 2 A's. The fall, however, is just as easy but I can't seem to get this topic of transferring off my mind. I had to change some classes for fall and was actually **running out of classes** due to the amount of AP Credits I came in with. Therefore, **the only way I will even be able to attend UCF in the Spring 2017 semester will be to declare a minor.** This is because the Radio/TV program here is application-based and requires a certain amount of credit hours obtained *at UCF.* So I would only be taking classes in Spring for that requirement.

I really just don't see much of a future for myself here. UCF is a great school for a lot of people, but **I just don't see a future for myself down the road here.** The University is in I guess what most people would call an expansion stage; a large portion of this campus is under construction and the school has recently developed connections to funding and internships almost exclusively for STEM Majors and are now looking at opportunities for other majors. Our President is getting very old (no offense to him, but he took the position of President in 1992!) and he's been a good leader that I feel he will be hard to replace. He wasn't even able to attend most of the Opening Ceremony here for freshmen as he left the stage early barely under his own control and he studdered with the teleprompters. This school also has a lot of resources and tuition paying for things I do not even use. There is a *huge* drug and alcohol prevention program, a Pride (LGBQT) place to name a few things and I just have no use for that. I'm sorry but this is college and I have no pity for people who are alcoholics or drug addicts for the most part and the money in my tuition that goes to that is just not reasonable to me and I'm not offensive to LBGQT people so yeah... On top of this, the Radio/TV program is seeming unstable to me. The first day of COM class, my professor showed up late with a very petty excuse and they subbed in another teacher who didn't know what she was doing for the most part.

All this worries me about a future here.

I'm strongly intent on transferring back home to FIU in Miami. Their communication program is application-based too but has less requirement including the credit hours. I also would find a job with the Miami Marlins and Florida Panthers to try to get a background in sports (the portion of radio/TV I want to go into) and it will also give me connections and the opportunity to work for a team if I can't find a job with my degree. Plus, it will be cheaper and I won't be paying for these ridiculously priced meal plans and stuff. Living away from home is expensive and I didn't realize how different it can be until now. I'm not homesick as I've done very well here as you can tell, I just think I have better opportunities and a path down the road back home at FIU instead of here at UCF. My brother graduated 3 years ago and still has not found a job with his degree and I just would hate to see the same thing happen to me.

The problem with this is going to be convincing my parents about it. They are very ""helicopter-ing"" as the UCF First Year Advisors put it. I originally wanted to go to a community college for one semester  (to avoid this situation) but my parents insisted I go to a normal school. My parents have this sort of pride I guess with me going away to school, but in all hoenesty, they won't be able to afford this place after the first year and they refuse to admit that.

I have until November 1st to submit a transfer application to FIU and I am confident at this point that I would want to submit one. I got a partial scholarship here to UCF and I have no doubt that I'd be accepted at FIU at this point.

Help!

How should I approach my parents about this?

For transfer students, can you tell me what influenced your decision to transfer?

I also am very not looking forward to making the trip to the advising office to talk about this. I'm not looking forward to the ""Are you sure? UCF is a great place to be!"" speech.

675,apfwilson,1472508944,/r/college/comments/507om6/transfer_student_having_a_bit_of_a_hard_time/,"So I just transferred from a community college to a four year university. I had a fairly active socail life before I came here, but now that I'm here, I have limited socail interaction.

 I'm living in a dorm because my planned house roommate bailed and I thought it would be a great place to meet people. I have been hanging out with some cool people in the top floor lobby, but I don't feel like I'm really that close with any of them. Almost none of the people on my floor want to talk to each other, and my roommate is pretty much always out with his girlfriend. I've been trying to stir up more conversations with him and the people on my floor, most of which are D.O.A.

I've applied for hall counsel and a few clubs, but they won't be starting for a bit. Additonally, I plan on getting a work study job, but again, that won't start for at least a week. I usually get my homework done early, there is way less than I thought there would be, so I have quite a bit of time to kill these days.

I've even tried going to events via a ministry, (and I'm not even religious) just to meet people. There are some nice people there, but I think the religious barrier could turn into a problem if I get too seriously involved. Plus, they are a little clicky, and I'm not sure I'd fit in.

The only thing I haven't really tried is frats and the greek life, but in all honesty, they pretty sketchy here, I've heard some hazing stories, and they just seem expensive and time consuming. I just feel like I'm a little old for them anyway, so I don't want to bother trying to get accepted if they aren't instrested in upper classmen.

The bottom line is, I'm bored, I'm lonely, I'm getting kind of tired of putting myself out there, and I'm developing anxiety. As of yet, this experience hasn't been what I thought it would be. You're not constantly going to parties, meeting girls, so and so forth as advertised.

I'm a freshman. It's embarrassing to talk about, but I've survived three suicide attempts so far since 7th grade and have a formal diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder as well as PTSD, general anxiety, and borderline. My insurance doesn't cover the medications I would need to be on so I don't take any (family can't/won't pay for it and I certainly can't afford it). 

I hate the school I'm going to, it's small and quiet which is not an environment I do well in (ironically enough), and I have no idea what I want to do with my life. For a long time I was considering pre-med but I don't think there's any chance I'll be able to keep up with the chemistry requirements because while I'm an excellent student chemistry has always been incredibly difficult for me. 

Right now I'm in a psychology program but if I want to be guaranteed a spot in the higher level classes I need to declare my major in about two weeks or they'll fill up, and I'm not sure I'm ready to make that commitment.

My parents don't want me to transfer until after this year but to be honest thinking about spending a whole year here makes me want to pull my hair out roots and all. 

I'm just incredibly depressed right now. I'm not even homesick, though it is hard not having anyone nearby, friends or otherwise, who I can be honest about how I'm feeling with. Every morning I wake up wanting to kill myself and every hour the feeling gets stronger. I've tried giving this whole experience the shiniest, positivest outlook I can muster up, but every single moment I've been here feels worse and worse. How much longer can I, or should I, keep going before I make a decision that involves me leaving this school?  

I want to do great things with my life, I really do. I've got a high IQ, I do well in school, but I'm tired of being miserable and don't think I can be this miserable for this long without something breaking. I can't stop thinking about killing myself. 

My parents don't understand that I can't just ~decide~ to be happy. I don't want to drop out. I don't even want to transfer before this year is over. I'm just so tired of feeling like this, this is not how I wanted my college experience to be. I was hoping to turn over a new leaf but this has been worse than any other time in my life.

What should I do? What kinds of things should I consider when it comes to declaring a major?

My room-mate is pretty cool, but he is from the area. I tried hanging out with his friends, but it feels awkward being the only person in a group who doesn't know anyone else.

Coupled with the fact that I am decently slow to warm up to people (to the point where casual conversation is easy.  I can keep a brief conversation with a stranger, but it's not the easiest thing), and that a lot of people I've seen have already found a niche of some sort, it seems kinda hard for me to make new friends and meet new people.

We have a club fair on Wednesday, when school starts, which I will without a doubt be attending. Besides that, and trying to strike up conversations with people who seem to be on their own (which I've tried to do a bit of), what else can I do?

I come from a Baptist family, and currently still attend a Baptist church. I have been homeschooled my whole life, up until last year. All my classes after 4th grade were online, pre-recorded lessons. Long story short, didn't socialize except when at church, and spent all my learning time in front of a screen. I've always been very good at school, especially math. 


Last year I started attending a school which was specifically designed for Christian homeschoolers who wanted to take classes that needed to be taught by an actual teacher(Calculus is hard to teach yourself...I tried). My social(outside of church) life started almost exactly one year ago. I'm pretty awkward but considering the consequences I'm ""alright"" when it comes to being chill. I was very sheltered in high school, evidenced that I went to the movies with friends without parents on the scene for the first time earlier this year, right after finishing my Junior year. 


I discovered the Internet when I was around ten years old, and have had pretty much unfettered access to it since then. In that time I've learned quite a bit of technical knowledge so any filters or blocks were easily subverted. Needless to say, I am fully aware of almost everything that can be seen here, and I doubt you can shock me with anything. So in that sense, I was not sheltered at all(much to my parents' dismay I'm sure). 

Anyway, I start my senior year very soon. I have the amazing opportunity to be taking Calc 3 and be a TA in Physics at this school, which is a dream come true for me. I plan on applying to a research or tech university for my Bioinformatics or Computer engineering degree(I have been programming for 3 years). 

The problem. 

I have been reading some of the askreddit college stories posts, and have been getting more and more apprehensive after each story. I feel that I will be jumping in to a completely unknown world. I'll be going from a deeply religious background(of which I still hold the belief), and being fully immersed in a secular college experience a thousand miles away from my parents, as a 17 year old. 

So, what should I know? Is there anything I should be doing right now as a senior, or things I shouldn't be doing?

Also, haven't had my first kiss yet.

A little bit of background: I got into a good undergrad business program after getting my HS Diploma @ age 15. Great at exams but never studied or did homework. Hit the brick wall that I deserved and got dismissed with a 0.0 gpa after a year of college. Tried to go to a community college and hit the same wall, 0.2 gpa after a year. No drug/partying problems, just never attended class.
Fast forward a couple years, I decided to re-invent myself during a volunteering trip abroad. Went back to the same community college and studied/attended diligently. I eventually raised my 0.2 into a 3.875 and am currently going through a transfer to a good 4-year school in order to continue my business studies.


I'm now 24 (as of yesterday!) and fairly late compared to the curve. Most of my friends have been working for 3+ years after completing their degrees, while I'm barely half way done. I am set on going through with an MBA program, but need some advice. Post-undergrad, these look to be my options:

- Enter the business world at the age of 26, compete with 21~ year olds and hold a job for 2-4 years before applying for MBA's.
- Apply for MBA's straight out of Undergrad without any relevant business or corporate work experience.
- Push my dream aside and settle for something different.

I feel as though working with a much younger set of people would be a constant reminder of my previous failures, and knowing myself I'd probably get really depressed. I'm trying to find a way to fast-forward my path, even though it looks to be an unlikely process.
I'm proactively studying for the GMAT, and am actually loving the CAT system. I'm thankfully still pretty good at taking exams, which is made even better by the fact that I actually give a damn now. I'm scoring pretty high, but have a long way to go and am only starting to understand what I need to work on the most to progress. 
Here are my questions:

- Can you think of any other options?
- Is taking a shot at an MBA program without work experience a big deal?
- Is there something that I can do during the next two years to counteract my work experience disadvantage as an applicant?
- Are there any sorts of certifications (that I could do while also studying) that could help me out?

I was born into an abusive home (physical but mostly emotional). First generation here in the US (but parents are college educated in their countries). I have had severe depression since 8th grade but undiagnosed until 20 (do have a history of cutting in H.S.) due to the abuse.

Regardless, I am highly intelligent and did great in H.S. All AP classes and graduated with a 92%. I had no self esteem so i just applied to my local college (which is terrible). My city is also poor and underperforming (though I didn't know this until I met other people from other places). In my high school if you even got a 3 on an AP exam it was rare and worth celebrating (while other students in AP classes in other cities it was expected). My city is a border town so very poor, though I did go to one of the better public high schools.

I went to the local University and graduated in 3 years. ONLY because I was living with my abusive family and it was my only way out. I wanted to be smart and not just runaway without support. I did not get that much out of my education sadly. One because it is not a great university and two I was in such a hurry to get out of there, and lacked the knowledge of how universities worked. I did not know that I needed internships for experience. Again, I had to navigate everything about college on my own. My degree was also too generic, Mass Communication. I also just have loans. 

Fast forward a few years, I finally tried to get help for my trauma, and it took a VERY hard 4-5 years. I was hospitalized 3 times, 1 suicide attempt, and had so many diagnoses. Finally it was just PTSD, and depression. I tried to get help but honestly, because I am ""educated"" and not on drugs or an alcoholic or single mother, it was almost impossible to get help. I finally got on disability and am in the process of having my loans discharged. The 4-5 years I tried working but it was almost impossible between the depression, suicidal thoughts, and medication changes.

I'm FINALLY stable and for the most part happy. I am enrolled in community college and have about 12 credits, though I can barely afford it. 

My question: I NEED to go back to school to get a real degree that will help me. I want to do graphic design (that's what I started in CC). BUT as you all know a GOOD school makes a HUGE difference! I want to go to a good university! I had the grades in High school, but 2.75 in college (again due to the untreated depression and in an abusive relationship). I have since improved my grades (3.2) BUT every university I've seen will only take me as a transfer student or grad student. I don't have the grades for that. I hear about homeless people getting into great colleges, but how?

How can I show admission officers that I am more than my transcript?! The only reason I have a Bachelor's is because I was trying to do the right thing WHILE being my only option to move away from my family. They have NEVER helped me financial (and of course emotionally) during college, and even told me when I finally moved away they specifically told me they would NOT help me financially if I chose to move out. So I've been on my own since 19. 

What can I possibly do to show colleges that I am worth investing in? Worth accepting (even on probation to show my worth)? I would also need a scholarship as I ""make"" under $800 with SSDI AND I can't apply for FAFSA until the 3 year period is over to discharge my previous loans.",college,"29F, Will any college help me?",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4tgmzh/29f_will_any_college_help_me/,1468884519.0

My experience wasn't the greatest. I enrolled right after high school, and went on to fail a few classes in my first semester due to a combination of mental health issues and immaturity, and subsequently dropped out for a year. 

Fast forward -- I decided to enroll again. I did a little better this time around. I earned twelve credits. However, I quit going for another semester since I still lacked solid direction. I finally became serious in January 2015. 

Ever since then, I have been working fairly hard, and have gotten all A's except for one C in Statistics. During the entire course of my studies, I was employed full time. Somehow, this didn't really bother me too much until I went overboard with the amount of credits I took during one semester. During this past session (spring 2016), I worked the graveyard shift while taking 17 credits. I was beginning to go insane. I was depressed, lacked sleep, and had no spare time. 

I have now been accepted to all four colleges I applied to as a transfer student, but only one of them is cheap enough for me to attend. I have tried almost every financial aid avenue out there. I am getting the Stafford loans (Sub and Unsub), a scholarship offered to me by the school, and a state grant. 

All of that will be enough to cover my tuition and fees, but I still need to pay rent on an apartment, which would be about $500-550 per month when adding in the utilities and internet. (The school is an hour away from where I live, so commuting is out of the question). By this point, I'm worse for wear due to burning out. 

I am really not looking forward to the oncoming hell that will be work plus school again. I've matured a lot over the past two years and have come to appreciate the value of higher education. I would go in a heartbeat if money was no issue, but this is just too much.

https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4l0e5a/i_was_dropped_from_my_class_a_day_before_the/

That thread has all of the information you need to know up until this point, but I'll give a brief summery. I go to a very intense college, and the absence policy states that if you miss two classes, the professor is allowed to withdraw you. Excused or unexcused, it doesn't matter. You can have the most valid reason in the world to be absent and you will still get dropped because ""you deserve the full experience"". Some teachers choose to enforce it more than others. The reason it is so harsh is because we have a type of class called a ""studio"". These classes meet once a week, run for eight hours, and then assign an absolute mountain of homework. Students in this program have three studio courses a week. 

In my personal situation, I was dropped from the course on the last week of class because I was absent for two days, and two hours of class. The absences were due to medical reasons and doctor's appointments. The two extra hours were due to a hearing in which I testified. Even though I had made up all of the work, was fully ready for the final, and had good grades, I was withdrawn. I did not even receive an ""incomplete"" grade. My progress was voided and I am now being required to retake the entire course. This takes up a lot of time, and a lot of money on my part. Not only that, but because of being withdrawn from this class, I am now on academic probation and will lose my scholarship and financial aid, which are the only things allowing the privilege of attending this college. 

If you are curious exactly *which* school this is, you can refer to the comments under my last post, I just feel uncomfortable mentioning the name in the main body of this post.


Since that last post, I have met with numerous departments, deans, and advisors within the school. I have touched base with every department that I could think of being even in the least bit relevant to my situation. Every person I met with in regards to this issue was very impressed with the amount of effort I have been putting in to try to sway my professor's opinion. They commended me for working so hard for something that I wanted to change. 

I have decent grades as well, I currently have a 3.5 gpa, which is not particularly easy to maintain at this school.

I am not asking for an immediate grade in this dropped course, I am only asking for an opportunity to complete the requirements needed to receive credit and *earn* a grade. 

I have contacted the professor twice. Once in the initial correspondence when I was informed that I had been removed from the course, and once again the other day. The first time, I did not receive a response. This second time, I took a different approach. Before, I had tried to justify the legitimacy and need for the absences taken. This time, I approached him with suggestions for alternatives to a full class, but things that could potentially fulfill his requirements. 

I understand how much work allowing me to complete the course would mean for him, especially since it is outside of the semester. I offered researching other, shorter, weekend courses that could help me make up for missed studio hours and provide opportunity for critique from classmates (an important component of a studio course). I suggested writing an essay, doing an independent project, seeking out a related lecture, revisiting a previously assigned project, actually traveling out to his city to meet with him to save him the time and stress of coming here, etc. I showed that I was willing to go above and beyond because completing this course matters so much to me.

He responded today.. He said that he appreciated my eagerness to brainstorm alternatives and willingness to work, but that nothing could make up for the missed class time. 


I am at a complete loss. The dean of this department won't do anything, the professors have a lot of freedom in this school. The other departments I have met with are unable to do anything either. I don't want to stop fighting.. because if I lose, I'll lose the privilege of attending this school, for financial reasons and time constraints. 


**UPDATE:** I have been in contact with financial aid and I explained my case. They said that while I am on academic probation due to being below the required number of credits, I will still receive financial aid as well as my scholarship because I have good grades. So that's a relief.. Now the problem is that I cannot get a refund for the class, nor can I get the credit.. which is silly..

Don't be surprised at the amount of extremely overqualified and intelligent people here. **They're all in the same situation as you are in**. Instead of admiring them, **focus on what you have to do to reach your goals without putting yours in the shadow of their accomplishments**. (They're used to 90s on every test, but watch them drastically fall off their high horse when they receive a 60, while you've been on this path for a long time, it's hilarious)

I know that you made as many friends as you could because you knew nobody there, but **devote time to yourself**. I'm not talking about Saturday nights watching TV, I mean time to **plan your life out and actually do some studying**. **Run on your own agenda**, not what those around you are on and **learn to say no**.

A friend told you to pick social life and grades over sleep, and you tried, but it's easier said than done. Instead of staying in bed, use the extra time to **actually go to class** no matter how ugly it is outside and to **study just a bit more for an exam: every point matters**.

Late night fast food runs are always great with friends, but you'll be surprised at how much money it adds up to.

This university offers so many **free services and seminars** to help you out and you should explore more of them as well as **become involved in clubs**.

When you're stressing out about something, know that **there are people there to help, whether it's classmates who are feeling the same way, friends who want you to achieve your maximum potential, or your professor or TA**.

**Develop a great routine and great sleeping habits** and stick to it. When it becomes automatic things like going to the gym becomes easier: you'll find out about that a bit later.

Also, **never lose hope**. Some assignments will knock you down, life will hit you hard, and you really do get homesick even if you don't think you are. When you lose hope it's harder to accomplish things. **Find solace in your future, in your friends, and the people who believe in you**.

Have fun, but **don't go out every week**. You have more time than in high school and are more flexible, but how you utilize it defines how you do for most people. Going out every week is expensive, and pointless since you're not into hooking up especially in loud, boisterous, moist places. However, **don't stay in your room all the time** like your roommates. 

Meet people, do new things create memories that you're still looking back on.

In terms of the other gender, flings come and go. **Life's too short to worry over one person right now**. In high school you were with the same people every day, but now there are more options. Don't pine over one person, **expand your horizon. If someone's not worth your time move on**.

Your greatest years are ahead of you. Make your mistakes now so you can change them, but **don't put yourself in as bad of a position** as I'm in now. **Put in those extra hours of work, stay until the library closes and go to another library open 24/7 not only during exam season**. Use your resources.

I'm a freshman at an Ivy League school and I'm pretty sure that I'm about to flunk out. It's been an AWFUL year. First semester I was diagnosed with ADHD and literally had no idea what I was doing, but eventually managed to get a grip, pull a 3.2 GPA, and make elaborate plans to have my 2nd semester go *very* smoothly. 

But somehow I fucked that all up because I came down with depression so badly that it literally **knocked** me off my feet. I slept for 15+ hours a day. I missed so many classes. I wasn't turning in assignments, because I literally couldn't think. I wasn't eating. I wasn't showering. It SUCKED. My advisors/resident dean/proctors tried to help me out a bit, but it got to the point where I was so far gone that I would lie in bed all day, cry, and contemplate suicide. I stopped checking my email and answering my phone calls. I just didn't want to live anymore. 

Fast forward to a few days ago. Suddenly the cloud lifts THREE DAYS before I have to get the fuck off campus. I'm happier than I've ever been; I don't need to sleep, I have all this energy, and it feels like I've gone from the depths of hell all the way up to *cloud nine*. I scramble to get everything done, but can't because there's not enough time, I literally need to pack up my entire room and put everything in storage, and I'm bouncing off the walls so hard that I can barely sit down long enough to seriously study (Bizarre, I know, I'm starting to wonder if I have Bipolar instead).

So now, I just got home, I'm feeling calmer, and it's hit me: I FLUNKED this semester. I know for a fact that I failed at least 2 classes, and I'm freaking out because that mandates a mandatory leave of absence unless the administrators decide to cut you a break. I know I should reach out to my resident dean and my advisors to explain myself (they were aware of my depression, but didn't know the full extent of it), but I don't even know what to say. I really don't want to get kicked out of school, how do I go about fixing this?!?!?

Is going back to school right for me since it makes me overly stressed? 
-----
I went back to school last year to change my career to Engineering, but I find myself struggling. It's actually my original goal in high school, but somehow I took a different path when I didn't get into my top choice colleges. Now that I see the results of my attempts - several withdraws in the past 3 sems (5 total) and possibly getting my first D or F this sem :( It makes me question whether going back to school is the right thing.

A little bit of background. I had actually finished undergrad in 2011, though I had realized in 2010 that I was no longer interested in my degrees (Political Science + Econ) and didn't want to pursue a career in government and public policy anymore. Ended up working as an accountant and financial analyst for 2 years. I wasn't happy so I quit. Tried looking for other jobs, but with no good luck. During those times I felt lost and no longer sure what I wanted to do with my life. Ended up not working for a year. Found a short term job and worked for 2 months before deciding to go back to school in January 2015. 

I straight up took 5 classes since I wanted to finish and transfer immediately. It got too much and my bad habits from my senior year (procrastinating) kicked in. Dropped my physics class to attempt to salvage C++ and calculus. Things got worse and ended up withdrawing from those two so I can just focus on my CAD and intro Chem classes. However, dropping all those classes sent me to depression. How could I do so bad when I thought I'm finally doing what I really want to do? Other aspects of my life was bad too -- financial, dating, family. I had serious thoughts of suicide. It was the worst period of my life.

In retrospect, I jumped too deep into the water without warming up first. I met with a therapist as a last resort after being forced by a close friend. Luckily, the therapist was able to point out and explain what I was going through. Otherwise, I was really ready to end my life. (long story dating back to my childhood experience + gradual development of depression since 2010 after losing interest in my original goal + unhappy at work). 

I continue going to school since I want to become an Engineer. Last semester I took Physics, C++, Calculus, and intro to Engineering. Ended up dropping calculus again. I did well in C++ and Engr, but barely managed a B in Physics. This semester, I'm taking Public Speaking, Chem 1, Physics 2, and Linear Algebra. Dropped my math class after the first month. Struggled again in Physics and dropped it too :( I have been meeting with the school counselor to figure out what's going on with me and so I don't go back to depression. It's been helpful even if it's slow baby half-steps.

I love going to chem labs. I would not mind spending my whole day doing experiments and hands-on work. I do best in that setting. Not only I have fun, but my brain is actually functioning! Doing homework and studying is a completely different story though. It stresses the hell out of me. I have solid A in chem lab, D/F in exams and homework. It's absolutely hard to start it and even harder to stay focused. I would almost instantly end up doing something else. I really want to do well, but it's like my body doesn't listen to me and refuses to study. 

I met with a different counselor at the Disabled Services to assess my learning struggles. I can't meet with her again until Fall 2016, but she did say I definitely have red flags for ADHD. It's a bit funny because I never seriously considered myself potentially having one, so I started thinking more about it. I didn't notice until recently that I'm constantly having the need to touch and play with my hands. I also can focus well, but only when the activity is highly stimulating and interesting. I bought her recommended book plus other gadgets like this timer cube. If anything, I got even more efficient at doing chores which I never had any problem doing anyway (physical, hands-on) but studying/homework is still very much a complete struggle for me. Counselor told me to take 3 classes max per sem. At this rate I won't finish my degree until I'm already 30 &lt;.&lt; I don't mind really, I just want to do well and enjoy life. Studying and homework just totally stresses me out that I forget to enjoy things. 

At the end of the day, it makes me think whether being in school is the best for me? I do want to be an engineer and do hands-on work -- particularly materials engineer since I want to specialize in testing. I enjoy thinking about different variables, finding an object's limitation and applications, etc. I have tons of fun in chem labs. Sitting down to study and read though is a big sacrifice that I really struggle with :( I look at it in different perspectives -- investment, sacrifice, it's part of learning, things will get better, reward system, suck it up... but the same result. I end up not doing well and dropping classes. Perhaps studying and doing homework in school setting is beyond my capabilities? Should I instead find a hands-on job maybe in manufacturing or testing and work my way up from there? 

I'd like to hear some opinions. If you have any question, just let me know. Thank you for reading. It's very long &lt;.&lt; ",college,Back to school at age 26.

I am writing to appeal my academic dismissal from [University name]. I was not surprised, but very upset to receive a letter earlier this week informing me of my dismissal. I would like to urge you to reinstate me for next semester on a trial basis as described in the dismissal and probation pamphlet.
I must state that the initial reason I was put on probation is that I did a total withdrawal in November of 2014 due to my mental health as diagnosed by [University Health Center]. I did not realize that withdrawing at that time would render all my classes as automatic failures and I did not understand the process of a medical withdrawal. I did not intend to return to [University Name] at that time or any time in the foreseeable future so when I found out my classes were failures I was not concerned which is the beginning of my slide down.

I admit, I had a very difficult time past semester, and my grades suffered as a result. I don't mean to make excuses for my poor academic performance, but I would like to explain the circumstances. I know jumping back in with a full course load may not have been the wisest decision after being away from school for two semesters and with questionable mental health but I sincerely thought I could handle it. I most likely could have if it had not have been for circumstances beyond my control. In December my father underwent surgery on his rotator cuff. Normally this is a routine surgery but with my father’s age and aggressive career he healed slowly and was unable to return to work until recently. This left me to provide for my family which proved to be a highly stressful endeavor that I nearly failed at. We have been struggling to do even the most basic tasks such as put food on the table and about a month ago our heat was turned off. This combined with the aforementioned issues with mental health truly set my progress back. In addition, I am unable to drive and I was heavily reliant on other people to get to classes which meant I was at the whim of their schedules which prevented me from attending workshops for the classes I struggled with. These struggles are I have worked hard to overcome.

I have made every effort I can in order to make this coming semester a better one. I have received an accurate diagnosis regarding my mental health and we are pursuing an aggressive treatment plan which has proven highly successful in similar cases. I have also moved to [Campus Town, USA] so my lack of reliable transportation is no longer an issue. When I originally registered for classes for the coming semester I tried to keep my course load light and arranged in a way that allows me to attend tutoring workshops when needed. I also intend to make contact with my professors in the beginning of the semester to let them know I may need additional help outside of class and ask for their recommendations on resources for studying and absorbing the material.

I love [University Name] and I’d like to continue pursuing my Pre-Mortuary credits here before I transfer to [Other University Name]. If I am reinstated, I will put complete focus on my schoolwork, attend tutoring workshops, keep an open line of communication with my professors/advisor, and manage my time more wisely. Fortunately, now that my father has recovered and has returned to work, I no longer need to expend my energy to run a household. 

Please understand that my low GPA that led to my dismissal is not an accurate indicator that I am a bad student. Truthfully I am a good student that had a rocky journey but is now on the path to success and I will continue to make every effort to stay on that path. I hope you will give me a second chance. Thank you for considering this appeal.

692,matergallina,1461405933,/r/college/comments/4g2xci/finally_getting_things_together_is_my_plan_too/,"Background, but I'll try to make it easier follow.

I am 27, a wife and a mom of 3 with one on the way. Currently we live in an apartment, with both me and my husband working part-time. Husband is disabled, but SSI/SSDI is out of the question for now.

I have bipolar II. When I was 18/19 I tried conventional college at a tech school in a different state, was manic and didn't even try. Basically incompletes in every class. Next semester Not-very-kind-NParent forced me to move back home and enroll at the local community college. Again, still manic, and you can't force a manic person to do anything, whether they want to do it or not, so incompletes and fails. I just stopped attending halfway through both semesters.

Long story short, moved on, met husband, tried to responsible up and went to beauty school. It was an easy-out for me. (Sister did it, parents want me to be just liker her, etc.) Finished, completed, licensed, worked in a salon for a year. HATED IT. My life was HELL. I will never cut anyone's hair besides family EVER AGAIN. But now I'm stuck with the loan from this schooling.

That was years ago. I've moved on to farming for a season, then to retail where I'm at now. I want more for my life. I want to provide more competently for my family. My husband is sick a lot and I want to do as much as I can for my family because his plate is so full all the time.

So, I want to go back to school! This time of my own volition, in a field I enjoy. I've spent years thinking about what industry because I don't want my decision to be a spur-of-the-moment manic choice. I'm 99% sure I want to go into finance. Specifically I'd love to be a corporate cost/efficiency analyst.

I know how much schooling it entails, I'm prepared to work hard and dive in. My only qualm is money, for school and living expenses.

There's family housing at the community college I want to attend. 
It'd be perfect for my family. The cost is actually honestly a little cheaper than our apartment now. But you can pay in one lump sum per year. If we use our whole tax return, it'd cover all of housing costs besides power. So we wouldn't have to pay a lot of bills each month. That brings down the necessary amount to earn per month WAAAY down, meaning I can devote more time to school, I could even go full-time. A grant for the full amount would cover all of my school costs. We're on medicaid and SNAP so no medical bills and our grocery bill is very very low.

Does it sound like this has been thought out? Am I forgetting something? The worst part of bipolar is not being able to fully trust myself when coming up with ideas/plans.

(I do plan on visiting the disability center and getting any accommodations I might need, and going to office hours if I need to. I refuse to let the past happen again!)

This has been my goal and dream for quite a long time and I'm prepared to work hard for it. 

Thing is that one of my passions in music, specifically I've been playing Cello for 10 years. I'm even doing this program at my school allowing me to work alongside my elementary school music teacher. I'm kind of lost because I've lived most of my life with engineering (I'm part of the STEM academy at my school) and music side by side in my life. I've succeeded quite a lot in both of them, but I decided to stick to the engineering path because, well, I'm poor and I  have never thought to about making a career out of being a cellist, I just really love doing it.

I do plan to continue doing some sort of non-music major orchestra while in college, but I'm looking for something more. I've tried looking into an audio engineering degree, but I don't really enjoy it (will still continue researching it though). I was wondering if there was anything else that combined music and engineering (more focused on engineering)?

Okay. So, I'm a freshman in NYC for college.

The curriculum at this school works better for me, but I feel even less compatible with the people. 

I've tried being friendly in class and meeting people, but I'm a bit of an awkward introvert.

So I'm in my second semester of my freshman year at The City College of New York (CCNY for short). It's an okay school, and I am a computer science major. I'm required to take calculus 1, 2, 3, and differential equations (something like that). I had to drop calculus 1 last semester because I did really bad on the midterm (it was an evening class, my schedule was a whole mess and I really wasn't prepared for the transition to college). I'm retaking it this semester and it's a struggle but I'm definitely understanding the material more. 

I am also taking an Intro to CS course where we're learning C++, and its honestly really hard. The material went from moderate to really complicated, my midterm is in 2 days, and I'm honestly considering dropping the class. I'm not the only one either; most of the class is really lost and the recitation TAs don't help us at all. We literally show up, take a 15 minute quiz (which is impossible, how are we supposed to figure out a C++ problem in 15 minutes???), and leave an hour before the class ends. A friend and I tried to ask the TA for help before a quiz (since we always have a lot of spare time after the quiz is done) and he just said, ""no, we have a quiz soon"". When someone asked him about tutoring, he told us to use the message board where we can ask questions and the instructor posts up announcements, not actual/physical tutoring. We have had 2 group projects so far and the TA was supposed to make us explain/present them in class, but our TA seems like he doesn't know about them. Doubt they'll get graded. I know a fair amount of Python, Ruby and JavaScript, and honestly I dislike how C++ is taught here. I learned through workshops and an interactive classroom setting, more hands-on. The professor here always backtracks, doesn't fully explain things, and kinda assumes we know more than we actually do. The only other Intro to CS professor is even worse.

I've come to realize that this major may not be for me and even though I love programming (when I can learn at my own pace and I have the benefit of a good instructor), I'm terrible at math. I don't think I can deal with another 3 semesters of math. A friend who was a Computer Science major at Pace told me she did well in all her programming classes but her math classes really lowered her GPA. She never graduated and she only had 1 year left.

I'm honestly considering switching from Computer Science (CS) to Computer Information Systems (CIS); it's more of what I want to do with security and programming mixed together, and it involves a lot less math. I'm considering transferring to the New York City College of Technology (City Tech for short) since it has a 2-year program for CIS, and then a Bachelors in Technology if I want to continue, and CCNY doesn't have this major. Only problem is, I've been talking to friends, current students, and graduates, and I keep getting mixed reviews.
Some enjoy the school; one was a CIS major who's graduating soon and he enjoyed how it was very hands-on. He currently works for the MTA. I also heard that there's a lot of internship and job opportunities that are offered (no one takes advantage of them though so its a lot of space available). However, other people have told me that the buildings aren't well-maintained, the environment can be depressing, the students are ""lazy"" (they go to class but don't really excel and a lot play video games in the cafeteria all day), and it feels like high school. Some told me that the professors weren't great, and some don't offer office hours/tutoring. Most classes aren't difficult and the work is ""mediocre"" (a current student's words). I heard from two CS majors that the major classes are hard, and the CIS major who's graduating said the transition from CS to CIS should be smooth. He also enjoyed the school and the environment didn't bother him.

Another problem is that the graduation rate for City Tech is very low: like 15-25% in 6 years or so. I asked a previous student and he said that it's low because a lot of people end up transferring out or dropping out, and a lot of older adults come back while working to take classes /certifications. I'm not entirely sure how a graduation rate is calculated but the low rate in this school really bothers me.

They take walk-ins until August for admission to Fall 2016, and it's not selective at all. My counselor for a success program I'm in is currently on vacation so I have to wait to hear back form her next week about this. I've asked plenty of people and even though I'm 90% set on transferring, I'm not sure if it's the right decision. CCNY has a better reputation, but City Tech has the major I want. I also commute from home: 1 hour and a half for CCNY, while City Tech is only about 20-30 minutes away. It would be a better commute for me and I'd be learning what I want, but I don't know if I'm making a mistake.

A friend who has been working in the programming/IT industry for almost 20 years has told me that it doesn't really matter where you get your degree from or if you even have one sometimes: its about your work experience in the field. And that's true: I've looked at job applications that ask for 5+ years experience, not necessarily a 4-year degree. I do want to get a degree eventually, and I also want to take advantage of internships, but I'm not 100% sure if I'll excel at City Tech. I'm planning to schedule a tour soon once I talk to my counselor and finalize it if I do indeed go through with it.

I spent two years at community college, living at home, and not being social at all. Therefore, I introverted very deeply and got caught up in my own world. I am deeply fascinated by religion and politics and that was all that I obsessed about. 

So fast forward to this semester, I was painfully serious and extremely awkward. I probably made a lot of people in my dormroom uncomfortable. I would talk on and on about politics and religion, deriding the American political system and also critiquing the bible. Obviously, this was clearly the wrong thing to do. Also, I talked a lot about my future ambitions of becoming a politician in the same grain as my deep fascination with paganism, WWII, opera and classical music. Also, I voiced endlessly my opinions on the degeneracy of American culture, my hatred of alchohol, and other antisocial things. In other respects, I thought I did well socially and comported myself so for the first couple of weeks it was a mixed bag until I really ran downhill. 

So long-story short I got a girlfriend and lost her and it was devastating! After it was over I ran to my RA's office and I was about to burst into tears the night it happened. For weeks on end I talked endlessly about this girl, because I didn't receive closure from our relationship, so I tried to resolve it myself internally but it just didn't click. I got extremely depressed and I had a hard time being positive. Actually, that's an understatement. I was so depressed I constantly talked about the meaninglessness of life, the inevitability of death, my frustrations and hatred with all the people who were doing well at my university etc. I think I even cracked a few suicide jokes. It was bad. I had painfully low self-esteem, I was awkward, and I thought that was the end of the line for me. 

But things are turning around. After being so overly pessimistic I drove away another friend of mine who was a girl, and irritated the living shit out of a good number of people in my dorm, I finally figured myself out and got my feelings in order and in check. 

I had a long talk with my friend who understands what I'm going through with depression and emotional volatility. She explained to me that the people in my dorm disliked me not for me, but for my negativity! And that I had the potential to be a cool guy, intelligent and charming, all I needed to do was to get out of my dorm and to get out of my head. 

So I'm a total atheist, but I've been going to catholic church and meeting a good group of kids there with whom I get lunch every now and then and with whom I've carried myself pretty well right off the bat. My feelings about god and the bible have definitely started changing and I'm going on a mission trip with them to the phillipines this summer! Also, they are inviting me to join a catholic fraternity and also to join the knights of colombus which would definitely help me be more social. 

I've also cut the negativity, politics, and religion. From now on it's just normal teenage stuff. I'm a little rusty and I'm totally new to sports and all, but I've found that just talking about some sports with people definitely helps the socialization process. I'm also trying to be much more kind, considerate, and helpful to the people in my dorm and i really think I'm turning their opinion of me around. It was so bad that even the weird people in my dorm building got a hello from the RA's but I didn't get hellos from the RA's! I think that's turning around. 

Also, i ran into two old high school friends who are now popular and well liked and even though this semester I alienated two perfectly healthy young girls from my life, I think I really did well with a third girl this weekend when we went out for food. I think that if I become friends with them, it might be an angle for further socialization! 

The situation isn't perfect, there are two RA's (very pretty girls too) who think I'm a total weirdo and are very uncomfortable around me and don't speak to me. Also, I've been on long conversations with my mom on the phone in my room complaining about college and life and I don't know how much people heard (probably not a lot i'd imagine but still!). And finally and most painfully, you don't get a second chance at a first impression. I figured out the issue, I was trying to sweep two years of depression under the rug and expecting college to be this perfect paradise where everything falls into place. When it didn't I had a nervous breakdown and it was bad! Now that I've identified the mistake, have tried to do damage control and rectify the error, I feel much better. However, it would have just been much easier (considering how many opportunities and how much things were going right for me at the beginning of the semester) if I'd just started off with the way I am now. Now it's an uphill battle and I've got to live with the all of the embarassing things I said, exposing to everyone my insecurities, and being just a weirdo. I hate failure and I sure failed. But I'm positive I can turn it around, anyways, not going to give up now am I? 

Advice, anyone been in a similar situation? 

I want to win my two RA's back over. I want this social mishap to never happen again. I also want to know what people think of this sort of emotional breakdown (Actually, thankfully, I kept my social circle to a minimum so not a lot of people so me at my worst but still!) and other thoughts on the matter!",college,Made some significant social errors in my first semester at college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4bcfly/made_some_significant_social_errors_in_my_first/,1458587962.0

I decided to attend a  small public state university and transfer on later. I took fall semester 2014 off cause i missed deadlines. I attended spring of 2015 and had to take pre college algebra class cause i did bad on the placement exam.

I had a 3.0 my first semester and decided to take algebra in the summer, but 2 hour classes led to me skipping a bunch and i ended up failing. One F so far.
Then I retook it in fall of 2015 and I failed yet again... Two F's now.

So at the moment I only have 15 credit hours and I feel like I am very behind...
I came into school as a biology major but I changed it to CS cause people telling me med school is expensive and really hard.
I have very minimal interest in  CS and have no interest in coding or computers and I am horrible at math, and the future calc and harder math classes will kill me! Everyone told me I can get a good job after 4 years if I do CS. I have not taken any classes relating to my major because I have to pass algebra first, so if I pass this semester I still have time to change it. On top of all this I have 9k worth of federal loans cause I am an idiot.

Im taking 3 classes right now (college algebra is one of them) and doing horrible cause of all the stress of work, school, and I feel like im depressed. I have no motivation to go to school, lost all contact with friends I made my first semester and now I have no idea what to do. I have tried taking career finder tests and still cannot find anything I like, i honestly feel like I have no hope and this is pissing me off and adding to the stress/depression even more.

700,Weiss10,1455563688,/r/college/comments/45y499/transfer_student_messed_up_dont_like_my_major/,"Hi there. So, I went to a community college as a Comm. Major in order to get my pre-reqs out of the way. Unfortunately, prerequisites were all I took in CC, not taking a lot of room for experimentation. 

Fast forward to now. I have transferred to one of the most prestigious universities in my state. And I love it. However, I started as a Telecommunications major, 3rd year transfer. I'm at the start of my second semester and realize that I don't want anything to do with Telecom anymore. Nothing.

So, I've been going to two career counselors, fighting doubt, depression, anxiety and more as I try and get myself through this exisitental crisis. Other majors I've considered are Health Science, Education, Public Relations, Business Management, and Computer Science.

I have always excelled far above my peers in English and writing, did well in science if I studied hard and liked the material, and ALWAYS struggled in math. I am a people person who enjoys helping others and making people happy, and I enjoy video games, writing, computer software and hardware, theatre and performing in my spare fine.

The constant pressure for STEM by my surroundings has left me quite nervous and conflicted. As someone who is interested in coding and computers And never did well in math, do I truly have the grit to endure Calc 1-3, Linear Algebra, and so on? Was I just ""taught wrong from a young age"", like some believe? My family all feels like I would do well in PR but I've even thought about law enforcement Like my dad, or grad school to be a medical tech like my mother. 

Acknowledging and having made peace with the fact that I will take another year to graduate, I have until the end of this spring semester to decide. It's been tough.

What does /r/college think? Any stories of similar plights to shsre? Should I bite the bullet for CS or HS? Should I go into something with my strengths? I have a little interest or strength in all of the majors I listed above. I've really lost my way, and I've been spending the last 1.5 weeks getting myself back on track, and the fact that I don't excel at STEM like I'm expected to really makes me sad, and even envious to the CS or engineering people of whom it comes much more naturally to.

701,throwmeawaytoopls,1454634599,/r/college/comments/448fkh/motivated_to_turn_it_all_around_now/,"Hey Reddit. Posting this as a throwaway cuz some people know my other username IRL and I'm a bit ashamed to admit all of this.

**Preface:** I'm in my 2nd year of college with 23 hours out of 42 attempted completed. I've dropped 5 of 6 drops allowed. My GPA is 2.27 and I want to major in engineering. I have been in community/junior college my whole college career due to lack of confidence in acceptance of universities with semi-poor performance in high school. (Class rank was top 40%) My SAT score was 1650, scoring 77th percentile in math (610), and 64th percentile in Critical Reading (540). Writing was 56th percentile (500)

&gt;**Preface after the Preface:** I'm just now being medicated for ADHD, and I will (hopefully) be receiving hearing aid help due to enough hearing loss. I already have hearing aids, but they are getting older and getting to a point where they need to be replaced soon. I've been suffering from depression since around junior high and I'm just now getting counseling for that and my anxiety/stress management issues. 

**And now to today.** I am only taking 3 classes with one of them being an 8-week class and the other being a blended course (half online, half in class) with 11 hours total. Calculus, Physics, and Business Management. This is low due to being overwhelmed by stress, anxiety and the lack of focus that I had my previous semesters. 

&gt;Although still early in the semester, my performance is multiple times better than that of my previous 3. I scored a 79% on my first calculus exam and I'm now studying for my next one so I can do much much better and bring my grade up in that class. (Currently an 84%) I know I am capable, I just need to work on the self-discipline and learn how to study efficiently. I come home and immediately knock out any homework I have and then do a few practice problems in both physics and calculus to make sure I stay on top of my studies. I'll finish everything in about 2 - 3 hours and then I have enough time on my hands to make myself extremely bored. To remedy this, I have downloaded a few textbooks and got to reading about my hopeful major, taking in whatever I can. 

In other words, I'm trying to keep myself busy to distract my brain from going to those depressing thoughts. It's extremely helpful and I wish I had done this sooner. I think I can handle one more class on top of the current load I am facing.

I need information that I've been trying really hard to find and it's bothering me a bit. I'm attending a transfer information seminar tomorrow so I might get answers there, but I also want to iron out a few things and see if y'all can help me come up with questions to ask the adviser in regards to my conundrum. 

&gt;First of all... If my semester goes well, and I get all A's, I believe my GPA will come up dramatically to almost a 2.9. The engineering college I want to go to requires a 3.0 to be reviewed, but they recommend higher in order to be competitive. If I take proper courses and get another semester of All A's, I will bring my GPA even higher. I guess what I'm getting at is... I feel like I can recover from my fumbles in my first 3 semesters and prove I am capable. Is it possible that the admissions board will look more at my recent performance than my overall academic record? Also, they state that they include incomplete classes and withdraw/fail classes into the GPA calculation. I'm not sure if my current school does this, so how can I know? This is my biggest concern.

My issue then becomes my academic record of dropping classes. My state (TX) allows at most 6 Q-drops. However, the school I want to transfer into only allows 4 Q-drops. Since I have 5, what will happen? Will they automatically deny my transfer request or will I potentially be able to transfer (given I meet requirements for transfer) and then just not be able to Q-drop a class at all? 

Last, but most definitely not least, I need to know if there is any way my hearing loss can impact my chance for acceptance. I have looked far and wide, but almost everything I've seen about Learning Disabilities refers to those that are much worse off than I am in that regard. I am currently on the state record of having the disability and I am receiving proper accommodations for it. 

WITH ALL OF THIS INFORMATION... What other questions should I raise for the advisers to answer? 

I'm in quite a predicament, but I can dig myself out of it. I tried to format this as best I could in order to make it not so wall-of-texty. But anyways... Are there any recommendations? Should I withdraw after this semester and work for a year and get my head straight or should I keep at it? Is it possible I could get a semester or two completely overlooked somehow?

I wouldn't mind attending a liberal arts college personally, though so far I haven't applied to many. Right now, I'm mostly anxious over the fact that I can't make it into NYU, or so I predict. Its requirements are pretty high, and my GPA is only a 2.6 despite having all A's and B's this semester, and my SAT is a 1740 (630 in both writing and reading, 480 in math). NYU is my top choice since it's a big center for the creative arts, and I can't really name any other realistic choices like it. I tried portraying my immense desire to attend in my essay, as well as an explanation for why my junior year grades were atrocious (ADHD, underestimating A.P. difficulty, not familiar with certain subjects), but I still don't think that will be enough. Honestly, I have no idea what to do if I can't get in. The only two I've been accepted into so far are George Mason and Drexel, but I feel those were much too easy for me to get into, and I want to attend a more challenging school. The only other schools I feel I would want to go to would be Syracuse, UCONN or Fordham. 

Anyway, I've been reading that attending an elite school will obviously financially benefit you more since you have better job opportunities through your school than in a medium-ranked college. This is another thing that made NYU appealing to me. However, like I said, I probably won't get in, and the only two I have gotten in aren't as prestigious like the latter. So now, I'm freaking out about not only the level of education I'll be receiving, but my financial state afterwards, since I won't have a leg up compared to the rest of the country. I've never wanted an office job, I've always wanted to enter more prestigious work and make a name for myself. I wanted to be influential in the creative arts, but the more and more I examine my situation, the more I realize my past stubbornness and arrogance has hindered that, and thrown me to the bottom of the well. 

So, I'd like to know from the more experienced as to whether my anxiety is justified and that my situation is dire, or if the college I attend doesn't really matter, so long as I work hard or something that is factually supported. Also, how much does any of this matter with the major I attend to get, since I've read some people say the quality of film majors don't depend on the school you attend since the education is mostly universal.

704,ael1234,1452095811,/r/college/comments/3zqctp/how_fucked_am_i/,"Hey everyone. I fucked up. My first semester of college, and I really fucked up. Same story as a lot of people; I breezed through high school with no challenges, little studying, graduated as one of the top in my class etc. Got to college, and had my ass handed to me. But for most people, they learn and improve before the end of the semester. Not me. I tried, I really did, but to no avail. I studied and worked hard, and still got two D's. Which resulted in me getting a 1.99 gpa my first semester of college. And I'm also on academic warning. (Are probation and warning two different things?) 

Now, I was in a science field, but I quickly learned early on that it wasn't for me. In high school, I liked science enough. However, I've always liked history and english a lot more, and always excelled at those things too. Science and math (chemistry especially) was always a struggle for me, even in high school. But, I love animals so I thought I could get over it and force myself to like science. Well, I learned I couldn't do that. Not only did I not like the classes I was taking (no interest whatsoever) I was really bad at them. So, I changed my major to Political Science. I'm really happy I did this and I'm super excited to start the classes I have next semester as I have a genuine interest in them. BUT, I'm still stuck with my original problem. The giant 1.99 GPA staring me down.

So I need advice. First of all, how will this make me look further down the road? I did fine in my non-science classes that I took (an A and a B) but I got D's in my science classes. Second, what can I do to improve? I already have to schedule a meeting with an academic advisor and another person to talk about what I'm going to do to improve. And I plan on utilizing office hours this semester (something I realized way too late in the game last semester). But what else? Last, is it possible to overcome this? I feel stupid. I feel pathetic and like a failure. I've never in my entire life heard the words ""academic"" and ""warning"" next to each other in a sentence. I've never seen a GPA below 3.5. My family doesn't know how bad I've done because when they asked me about classes I just said ""Oh I'm doing fine"", but clearly that isn't the case. I also really want (and kind of NEED because of money reasons) to become an RA next year, but I need at least a 2.5 and I think I may have ruined my chances there. I feel so awful. I just need someone to tell me that I'm not a complete failure and that there is a light at the end of this tunnel.

So sorry for the long read, but I just have had this bubbling up inside of me and I just really needed to write this all out. Thanks for any advice you can give! ",college,How fucked am I?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3zqctp/how_fucked_am_i/,1452113811.0

Every year I sat out I tried to reapply to get back in, but i kept getting rejected. Anyway, this past summer I was finally accepted and took two classes and ended up with a 4.0 so they allowed me to continue for the fall.

I wont lie, I was pretty rusty this semester and trying to get back in the groove, but I did well in my core classes. My elective classes are what screwed me over so my GPA for the semester was under their minimum and they dropped me. I had no clue about about the minimum semester requirement, but I guess that has no weight in my argument. I honestly thought I was bound by the appeal form I signed, which was to get to the 2.0 by the end of Spring 2016. Ive tried talking to my counselors in my college, but they all stick to the script and say theres nothing I can do. Although, one counselor said I could come back for the summer. I really cant afford to miss any more school, as Ive already sat out for 3 years and I have a kid on the way, so finishing as soon as possible is important to me. The counselors dont seem to care about my situation at all. Ive gotten an A/B in all my core classes to get into my actual college, its just my electives that have screwed me over. In just the summer and fall, ive raised my GPA from a .67 to a 1.92.

706,beluganarwhalmutant,1450119680,/r/college/comments/3wti85/medical_leave_for_almost_four_years_how_to_go/,"**FYI, LONG story, as there is quite a bit to be said in order to paint the full picture.**

I had a rough time socially in middle and high school, to the point where I invested the majority of time into academics because it was the only place where I felt valued. After a harsh college application experience (as my dad had been out of a stable job for at least a year), I got into Brown U. in the spring of 2010 with an academic scholarship that covered 4/5 of the total cost. I was also accepted into Santa Clara U. with a full ride, but turned it down because I lived nearby and wanted to escape the area that I associated with a lonely and stifling adolescence.

Though I was ecstatic to be offered such a great opportunity, my excitement quickly dwindled as I started fearing the ramifications of starting college. I had little idea of what I wanted to do at Brown, much less study. To be honest, I had little idea of why I even *wanted* to go to college - there was not much more impetus there than the threat of having to resort to a low-wage job to survive if I chose otherwise. In fact, I applied to Brown on a whim, just because my friend at school thought it might be a good fit for me. In any case, reading the many threads on the Brown '14 Facebook page did little to ameliorate my anxiety in the preceding months. The opposite happened, and it only worsened with each incoming email, ""Congratulations!"", welcome, and farewell. 

One of the few things I *did* do in advance was register for a pre-orientation program for first-years, geared towards minorities but open to all. I still remember the tension in my body and the dread in the pit of my stomach as the day approached, and it amplified during my flight to Rhode Island and the day before the beginning of the program, when I was staying at a hotel in downtown Providence. The night before, I broke down and wished I could just go home. My mom, who had accompanied me, urged me to at least go and try. Try it out, and then I could decide whether to leave or not. So I did.

It wasn't as horrible as I had anticipated, but I felt like an impostor among the other attendees. I forced myself to go to some of the social events, where I met a few people and eventually formed a group (which I would be most familiar with for the next three semesters). They were cool, funny and interesting people with diverse backgrounds, and then there was me. I honestly felt I had little to contribute, and that I was outmatched by people in my classes. Because, really, compared to everyone else, I was a chubby spectacled spaz with little social grace, shitty fashion sense, no real direction, etc. You get the picture. I was an alien who had crash-landed by chance in a community of prime human beings.

This constant, rarely unwavering stream of thoughts and beliefs festered in my already overwhelmed mind, giving rise to relentless self-deprecation and outright phobia. The fall of 2010 (Semester I), it was understandable I feel flimsy, but the house of cards shook ever more intensely the following spring, where I dropped Gen Chem for the second time and during when my self-loathing and hopelessness manifested as skipping class, half-assing assignments, avoiding most forms of contact, and shutting myself in my room with the Internet to keep me company. 

After I found out I was on academic warning in the summer of 2011, I vowed I would work harder to make up for it. So I took five courses (the maximum workload for one semester at Brown), not including two science labs, in the fall of sophomore year. As my mental stability slowly crumbled, I started making visits to Psychological Services to talk about my issues with a shrink. It helped to tell someone, but I felt I was in quicksand and any effort to escape was causing me to sink faster. Yet I kept it bottled up inside me. It was in this period that I began to contemplate suicide. In this time, I also signed up with a medical brigade club on campus that was planning a trip to Ecuador over winter break. As the semester came to a close, my decision to kill myself was compounded by the fact that I had taken gen chem for the third time and completed the final, despite having done poorly on all the exams and being certain I would fail it. (A week later, I learned I ended up with a C - a miracle considering I had tanked on all other assignments. Goodbye, medical school!) My confidence shot to shit, I felt darkness surround me. I did my best to enjoy my week in Ecuador, not ready to face the return.

(**Now for the climax.**) We flew back into Boston, took the train to Providence, and went our own ways upon arrival. I entered my single and remained cooped up in there for the next few days. No food, little sleep. Then the day before spring courses began arrived, and I had yet to register for any. I also had to declare a major, which I had long since abandoned investment in. Trapped in a corner, my mind searched for ways to end it. Jumping off the top of the Sciences Library. Throwing myself in the path of a train. Provoking a police officer into firing at me on purpose. I went to the roof of another building, but couldn't muster the energy to jump. My being was throttled of life force and will, to the point where I could not even find an urge to careen off the top. Beyond distraught, I went to Psych Services, who urgently escorted me to the mental ward at a nearby hospital. My mom came to visit me. I was there for more than a week, through my birthday, with a bunch of other broken people, before I was released. The following day, one of the University deans sat with us in her office and requested I went on medical leave, which I obliged.

All of 2012 was misery back home in California. I chipped away at surface-level problems, but the black core of my despair remained intact. My shrink was no help, and ultimately made things worse when she signed my papers for medical readmission, which I was granted by the University. I was back at Brown for perhaps two and a half weeks starting at the end of January '13. While I was working to keep myself occupied, the distorted thinking and thoughts of self-destruction were not far away. I spoke what was really on my mind nonchalantly to the Dean during a check-up, which prompted her to quickly arrange another internment at the same ward from the year before. My mom crossed the country within a day to visit and keep me company. A blizzard kept us from exiting the building from recreation. If it wasn't for my mom, I would have gone bonkers. The Dean visited the next week and extended my leave, after which I returned home.

I've been here since then, February '13. I attended a local community college, where I had a perfect academic record - at least until I started going to the smoking area out of sheer loneliness. There I became slowly hooked into smoking weed and cigarettes, to the point where I would blow through two packs a day on my own. I spent a LOT of money on weed. My company were, in retrospect, troubled individuals as well; they drove me to do shit I felt was out of character but did anyway because I had lost my self-respect years prior. I applied for medical readmission again in the spring of 2014, but a week before they were to give me a decision, I did a very stupid thing. I fucking wrote I was going to kill myself - ON FACEBOOK. This impulsive, thoughtless action was triggered by seeing the graduation photos of the Class of '14 - the very people I had begun college with. They had finished, while I *felt* finished. Needless to say, after numerous calls from concerned individuals and a visit to my house from the police, the decision that I would not be readmitted was made. About the only thing I enjoyed from 2014 was the World Cup... in this year, I had also worked two separate jobs, which I quit both times because I felt I would be stuck there forever, with no future but endless shifts. Not exactly the best way to stitch together a resume.

The first few months of 2015 were much of the same, where I spent a great deal of time with ""friends"", aka poor saps who wanted a weed buddy or punks who used me as an emotional and verbal punching bag. Of more than a dozen attempted courses at community college, I completed only two. I got angry. VERY angry. I cut off those leeches and began to consider my life, where everything had gone wrong. There were no easy answers, or solutions. In the summer of this year, I visited my family in Argentina (I was born there). During this time, I connected with the stark reality of life in another corner of the world, which was dealt with in a lighthearted fashion by most of those I encountered. Here, I went through the weed/tobacco withdrawal, tried a lot of genuinely good food, improved my Spanish dramatically, and explored the city with my family members. I couldn't remember the last time I had gone out with people who were not apt to judge or belittle me. When I returned in late August, I felt a great rush of emotion. In this moment, I genuinely wept for the first time in forever. 

Although my spirit had been briefly charmed, my internal turmoil had periodic episodes of resurgence. In the spring, I applied yet again for readmission, which was turned down, with the strong recommendation that I take courses at a nearby four-year for eventual transfer credit. So I signed up at UC Berkeley. I didn't return to the States until the second week of classes, however, and found it hard to motivate myself to work. My greatest effort was a three-day ordeal to read and learn many pages of organic chemistry for the first exam, which I pulled a 96 on. Regardless, discouraged by my terrible study habits and total absence of focus/interest/desire/god-only-knows, I dropped them one by one. I stuck it out in Ochem lab, but I lost the drive to navigate through the material, and dropped it as well, a day before the final. That was last Wednesday, six days ago.

Since the second hospitalization, I've been seeing a psychiatrist and psychologist at Stanford Hospital. Their good intentions come up short, as I realize only I can truly solve my own problems. I am *still* reluctant to see my shrink, and though I feel empowered after spilling my guts to him and having him empathize and offer a plan of action, it evaporates soon after. I take a heavy dose of antidepressants, and have tried quite a bunch - at best, these have kept me in a sedative state, with no angst but not much of anything else either. At worst, I developed a voracious appetite and packed on the fat, on top of losing virtually all sexual drive and turning my member into nothing more than an exit valve for urine. As if that wasn't enough, my 23rd birthday is in February and I sense that time is encroaching on me quickly. My few friends are off living their lives, my parents are losing their patience, and the days have blurred into stagnant periods of sunlight interspersed with quiet darkness, which closely matches my general gloom.

If you read all the way to the end, I applaud you. I have not told any one human the entirety of this experience, not anyone at Brown, not the shrink, not my family nor my friends. I fear if I do, I will lose the little support I have left from them. That's why Reddit is awesome - because I can tell complete strangers with no investment in me whatsoever! What do I really want? To enjoy my time alive, to be interested and invested in something with uncanny fervor. And to **finish college**, if for nothing more than to use that as a symbol of my ultimate victory over my own capacity to self-sabotage.

**TL;DR: lonely boy becomes lonely college student, becomes mental college student, becomes mental case, and now wants to become something more.**

Two years ago I fell into a quite deep state of depression, so I dropped out of college, only to come back and failed all my classes because I couldn't find the strength in me to get out of bed in the morning to go to school. I was always either crying or sleeping all day, and lying awake at night staring at the ceiling and cry some more. However I didn't manage to drop out in time so the ugly grades stayed in my transcript. The same thing happened the next semester, and the semester after that. I was in a dark place.

I'm doing better now because I had help from my friends (god bless them, by the way). I found a job, and I went back to school again and am doing quite good. I tried to apply to a full-time program next semester but got rejected because of my failures in the past. My R-Score (the equivalent of a GPA) is ridiculously low because of that. I know I can raise it quite a bit with this semester's grades, but I can't apply until next year. I'm already 20 years old and I don't want to waste any more time. 

Moreover, I'm only allowed 3 free consecutive semesters of part-time studies. After that, I'd have to pay the full fee for my classes. I could apply to another college so that it'd be free, but it'd be hard adjusting.

What should I do? Is it possible to change what's written on my transcript or is it too late? I'm planning to get into Computer Science in University but I honestly don't know if I can make it.

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.",college,"Failed 3 semesters of college due to depression, what now?",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3uxojw/failed_3_semesters_of_college_due_to_depression/,1448951140.0

**TL;DR: Freshman mech. eng. at subpar college, receiving inheritance, looking to transfer to a better college.  Where should I be looking/what are my chances?**

Hi, I am a freshman working towards a mechanical engineering major at an average (at best) college which is known for its meh engineering program.  I attended a good high school in Pennsylvania where I did not work hard.  I graduated with a 3.2 weighted GPA.  I applied to Penn State and Drexel straight out of high school.  I was accepted to both but with next-to-no financial aid.  My expected family contribution was $0, so attending either school would have had me $100,000 in debt by the time I had my bachelor's.  I am in a strange situation where a forgotten family member from my father's side passed away this September and I am in place to inherit ~$40,000.  I want to make some changes in my life but I'm not sure where to begin.  The only goal in my mind is to get into a better college.  I honestly have no idea what to do financially, and neither does my mother (she's foreign and never attended college).  My test scores are relatively high but I plan on retaking the SAT this December (after serious studying).  I took 10 AP courses in high school and scored a 4 average on all of them.  I got 5s on all of the STEM-related ones (AP Calc AB/BC, AP Physics C:Mech).  I'm doing well on all of my courses in college.  I have the highest grades out of all the students in both my chemistry and calculus classes, and both professors agreed to write me letters of recommendation for some internships I'm applying for.

The reason I'm asking people for help is because I still feel the same way I did in high school.  Nobody in my family has experienced college, so I walked in blind.  I agreed to go to a subpar school in order to spare myself and my family financial strain while knowing that I would be unhappy there (I'm very far from home and friends and I don't feel like this school can take me where I want to go).  Taking out such high loans was an intimidating process so I chose to avoid it.  I made this decision with help from a counselor.  She was awesome but she had over 100 other students she had to help as well.

What kind of college do you think I have a chance of being accepted to?  I’d love to go to a great engineering school, but I’m more than happy with an above average one.  A big factor is financial aid, as even with the inheritance I still can’t expect money from my family (and some of the inheritance money is likely to be spent elsewhere).  I’m willing to take out a reasonable amount of loans.  I’d love recommendations on some lesser-known mechanical engineering schools that could meet my needs.

I tried my best to avoid any personal information in this thread.  Thanks for the help.

Hello!

My name is Kid, and I am currently 22 years old and have been attending Community College for.. Well.. About my 5th year now. I did, however, already receive my A.S. this last May with a 2.89 GPA. 

My life has been pretty cool and the age of 22 I have worked several technical jobs including boat towing, fiber optic installation, and even tried my hand in the marketing start-up business. I am pretty well rounded and rather exceptional regarding interpersonal skills and am finally really nailing out my hard-skills. I can fix and do just about anything, my motto is ""I know a little about everything and can learn a lot about anything."" Currently, aside from my studies, I am learning to model in 3-D space using a program known as Blender. 

Maybe I should mention that I am now a business major and that I ended up at my local CC after finding out from my state school that they would only transfer me in as Freshmen. ""Wow."" So, the idea is to now finish out this years pre-req's and then transfer to my state school in the summer or fall. at this institution I wil be pursuing a degree in business analytics with a concentration in information technology. If I do not lose a limb, my car, or sanity then I should graduate by year 2017. 

So, strangers of the internet, I ask you if I will be too old to finish school. I wil graduate at 24 or just before turning 24. I will work my ass of because I now realize that school is a vehicle towards my own dreams; however, I still contain a shred of doubt that I will be graduating and entering into a field where my competition will be people 2-3 years younger than me or people my age with more experience.

So here I am in college taking calc one.

We all try and study and spend a lot of time doing homework but he is just not teaching the class well. Also the last three tests averages have been below a fifty percent for the entire 100+ student class and he refuses to curve the grades because he thinks we aren't studying enough and are lazy students. We tried talking to him about this but he didn't agree and said his classes was not very hard because there are three students who get 100 percent on all the tests so we should too. I've never had an f before but have one now even though I study my ass off 6 nights a week for his class.

713,Deathbeam78,1448307748,/r/college/comments/3tzap1/freshman_with_no_friends/,"Hi, I'm a freshman at a small university with about 6,000 students. and I'm becoming depressed and lonely because I find it hard to make friends around here. I know what you might say that I should join clubs or frats, but frats aren't really my thing and the only club I would join is soccer. But in my school it is extremely hard to get a position in the soccer club. I know this may sound odd or completely bs, but throughout my 18 years of living, I have yet to meet someone with the same amount of interests as me or someone who ""like"" me. This is why I never had a best friend. For example, here are some of my interest:

sport: soccer (watching and playing)

Music: EDM and Rock (all types)

hobbies: video games , guitar, reading horror stories (/r/nosleep), etc.

It seems that every one at my school is preppy and like no one likes heavy metal or EDM. I wouldn't say at I'm an introvert, but I can be quiet at first, but really talkative if you stick with me (I know it sounds clique, but it's true. I once had one friend tell me in high school that when we first met, he tried to stop me from talking because I was talking and talking). Sure I had friends in high school but that was because I saw them 5 times a week, so we never hung out outside of school. Idk, it has been like this since middle school, and I thought college was going to be a game changer. It just seems that no one ever wants to be friends with me whenever we first meet.

I wasn't completely lonely throughout my life because I had a lot of cousins, so I would hang out with them and play soccer, go to the movies, the beach and whatnot. But that's because they were my cousins, and I can tell you that if I didn't know them I wouldn't have hung out with them.

I don't have the best social skills, so I could not bring myself to just to talk to a random person because it would be awkward especially if they don't want to be bothered. I'm afraid this will be my path throughout college. Having no friends, eating lunch alone, not doing anything on the weekend and just listening to post-rock and crying myself to sleep while all my other roommates are out partying and having a great time.

And what if I find a SO, who wants to meet all my friends. How embarrassing is it going to be if I tell her I didn't have much friends growing up? I had chances with a couple of girls but I turned them all down because 1) my social skills aren't the best 2) what happens when she finds out im a loner? This is why I rarely try to get a girlfriend because I don't want them to date a loner. Now, I don't want to make it sound that I'm anti-social or anything. I can keep a conversation going if I get comfortable, but it's a little hard with girls, but either way I'm not a complete anti-social person.

Idk. This loneliness may get worser, which could lead to depression which may overcome me. I just need advice or someone with a similar experience.",college,Freshman with no friends,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3tzap1/freshman_with_no_friends/,1448325748.0

I'm a first-year at my current university. I just got out of high school a few months ago. When I was in high school I was doing really well. High GPA, vice president of the Technology Club, in musicals/plays, yadda yadda yadda. Whatever. I have always liked maths, science, aviation, and computers, so I thought maybe physics would be a good direction. so after apps were due, I got accepted into my university's science college as a Physics major. I was so happy.

So, yeah. I had to take a mathematics placement exam, and although I love maths, I have horrible test-taking anxiety. Also yes I do have diagnosed psychological disability so it did affect my performance. (sometimes i have to just walk out of class to cry, breathe, or puke before a test, I can't eat the day before big exams, it's very bad :/) And basically, I got put into a lower-level maths class for people who needed to ""catch up"". It's a 7 week course where you need to get at least an 80% to stay in the college of science and engineering.

Yeah and basically I just... faded out of it completely. Every single exam we took I got a ""whatever"" score (in the 60-80% range). I tried going to the disability office, but they said they were completely booked and would not be able to see me until this Friday (my appointment is 45 minutes after my final ends, yay.)

I sat down with my professor and had a long talk about my situation, but he was honest with me, and we even went over the excel program they use to calculate our final scores. In order for me to get an 80% in the class and remain a Physics major, I would have to get 110% on the final, and 100% on the quiz we took friday (and I know I didn't get 100 because I didn't finish one of the problems)

and yeah.. so it looks like I am going to have to drop my major for one in the college of humanities/social sciences. I won't be allowed back into the science/engineering school, and even the business school, because I didn't meet the 80% curve. :/

and I understand strict rules like it, they just want to make sure I would be successful. I know physics is a lot of maths, that's partially the reason I picked the major. I really like it.

But yeah.. my test-taking anxiety just killed me. I had 100% in the homework, but a very low score in the quizzes/midterms portion.

It's been an extremely hard week... I don't know what I am going to major in now, but I know for sure I am going to be dismissed from the physics major. I've been really upset this whole week, and I know this week is going to be even worse, because my final is on friday, too. :/

It just sucks because I had really high hopes of being involved in physics, even from when I was younger. and now that I'm here, just a quarter into my first year... it's become apparent that that's not the direction I will be going in. I feel like my life has done a complete 180. 

I've just been very sad... I guess I need people to relate to. so, has anyone else been dismissed from their major? Has anyone WILLINGLY changed their major from science/eng to something else? How are you doing now? and if you're ok with giving advice, what do you think my options may be from here?

Here's my story. 

I was admitted as a computer engineering major(big mistake.... into a good university in 2011. I was excited to start a new chapter in life. First quarter goes alright. I was getting a feel for the classes, but got a 2.0 for the first quarter. I also hate to admit that I ditched classes and that's probably where I started declining. I skipped class to sleep in, play video games etc...I'm not a party person so that wasn't one of the reasons.

2nd quarter comes and I'm taking classes related to my major such as Calculus and Physics. I have never taken Calculus before and I thought Physics was going to be easy since I liked the subject in HS and did pretty well on it. I was wrong. Things started going left and right. I was doing bad in both of the two classes. I skipped some of my classes and failed the two classes. (C- on physics but I count it as failing because you can't advance with a C-). I ended the quarter with a horrible GPA. It dropped horrendously.

It also happened for the third quarter. I was taking a programming class. As usual, no programming experience. I was also skipping classes because it became a habit and as usual I did bad that quarter too. It was at that point where I was on academic probation. 

I took 2 summer classes (Calculus being one of them and also did bad on it. It was bad enough to pass though. I also did bad on my other class, but at least it was an okay grade...)

For my second year(2012), I was taking Calculus 2 and retaking Physics and also took some GEs. I failed those two classes. I don't know how I lost my motivation but I did. My parents told me to switch majors and I told them that I could handle and they trusted me. I let them down. 

I tried my best the next two quarters but I couldn't do anything. I did okay on some classes. I wanted to switch my major to Psychology and I took some classes for it, but it wasn't my thing. For the quarter before summer, I talked to my counselor about what I should do. Should I go to community college for a while and come back? She said that I should so I followed her advice.I signed a leave of absence. My parents weren't too happy about it. 

I went to community college classes and took some classes and did okay on them. I went there for 1.5 years. I was also talking to my counselor in my university and ask if I could be undeclared before I switch to computer science for a while and she said to talk to a counselor from there. I did and the counselor there was nice and giving me advice and told me not to take computer science as a major because I did bad on calculus. He recommended me to be an informatics major. I was supposed to come back as an extension student of January of this year, but he never email me back last year. I have no idea what happened to him. When I talked to a new counselor for undeclared, she wasn't very nice about it. She kept ignoring me. I called and asked to speak with a counselor and she kept insulting me, calling me a troubled child etc... She probably has tenure so I can't do anything about that. I even made an appointment and went up there and she never saw me. They said they will see me, but it never happened. They went on their lunch break...I didn't take classes for that quarter.

I was able to take extension classes for the next quarter though. I don't take the actual extension classes though. I go to the actual classes where regular students go and learn there. I came back and took 2 GEs and did pretty good! 

I took a class related to my major for summer. It was also a programming class. I also talked to a counselor in the middle of it and she said I would have to be an extension student for another 2 quarters. She gave me a list of classes to take. Great! I ended the summer class with a B+ which is nice considering my past. 

So this is a new school year. I'm taking 3 classes. (One statistics class, one CS class and one GE). I'm not too worried about the GE since I'm probably doing well in it. For statistics, I thought I was going to do well. I studied for the first midterm for a good week and was pretty confident about it. I got the results back and I did pretty bad.... The mean was about 76 and the standard deviation was 15. I was 2 below the SD.... I have a midterm coming up, and I studied for a few days and feeling good about it, but who knows.... For my CS class, there are 5 projects and for the first 2 projects you can work with a partner. Because I was enrolled late(out of my control, they basically accepted me during the 3rd week), I was unable to get a partner for the first 2 projects. I didn't know how to do it and the projects were really hard compared to the CS class I took during summer. I was unable to finish my first 2 projects, but I turned in what I could. We also had a midterm recently and we recently got the scores. Once again, I did bad. The whole class did pretty bad too. The mean was around a 65%, but I was way below that. I was also unable to finish my 3rd project but turned in what I could. The 3rd project was basically coding a GPS, and that is really bad. I'm not sure what to do anymore. I know I'm definitely going to focus on computer science after my upcoming midterm, but unsure of where to start. I've also tried using chegg for computer science, but I feel that they don't really help. I used chegg for statistics and that definitely helps compared to cs. Hopefully I will do well on statistics... Right now I'm not sure what to do if I fail 2/3 classes. I'm still not an official student yet until the next 2 quarters (assuming I do well that is). I stopped playing video games as much. I don't want to disappoint my parents anymore...

TLDR: Admitted to uni as a CSE major back in 2011. Did bad and failed my first 2 years because I skipped classes to sleep in,play video games etc. Requested a leave of absence and went to a community college for 1.5 years. Disappointed my parents. Came back this spring as an extension student and did well. Also did well for summer. Currently doing bad this quarter despite me studying for a week before the midterms.

Hell, thanks for even clicking.

Last year I attended a 4 year university with enough financial aid to get a full ride. Unfortunately, and to my unforgiving regret, I didn't take college too seriously at all and essentially failing out, getting academic suspension in my second semester (spring 2015), and losing my scholarships along the way of course. I have not even been back there since I got the email I was suspended (I never even looked at my final grades for that matter)

Since then, I've tried to gather my bearings and getting a couple jobs and working full time and more to save a little money. I am now in a position, with taking a semester off, where I feel serious enough to take on college again. 

However I don't like the location where I am at all and want to move someone else. Recently I got a tip from my cousin to room with him in another state that I really love and go to the local 4 year university, similar to mine, over there. Even though we haven't really spoken about it at all, this has me very excited and even more willing to go back and pursue my education. 

Now comes my thinking on this, because even though I am greatly excited and want this to happen, I'm also very skeptical. I'm unsure what it would take for me to get accepted into another university with me having getting suspended from one already. My idea is to transfer and take classes full time at a local community college next semester (preferably online, which they do offer, as I'm about an hour away from their campus) for this upcoming spring semester, and, if I do well enough, be able to transfer to the four year college and live with my cousin (barring everything goes as planned). The reason why I'm here is that I want to know if this plan would actually be able to work or if there anything else I would have to do in addition.

A few quick things to note so there maybe some less confusion:

- I do have some credit at my current four-year college, some from APs I took in high school and others from actually passing while in college. I might have about 15 credits, to ballpark it. Nothing too much though.

- I have no idea what in the world I want to do, as a career or as a person. I'm still separating the things I like from the things I love, which makes this very very hard for me to make any sort of decision. I wish I could say that I want to be an electrical engineer or a bio-medical researcher or an author, but I simply can't.

- The reason why I haven't spoken with my cousin about living with him yet is because I'm not sure if I would be able to get into the university right away next fall or not (hence why I'm asking here.) And even if it isn't right away, I'm unsure of a plan to go forward to get me there. 

- My ACT was a 28 I believe, if that matters for anything at all. Both 4 year colleges are state schools so I have no doubt if I had applied to the one I'm looking to now in high school I would have been accepted too.

- I do want to leave the area where I'm at, not because its a bad area, but just because I don't feel I belong here. I know, even it may seem like I don't, that I would love where my cousin lives. I've visited there once and had a ball and its one of those places where if someone asks you if you could live anywhere in the world, its certainly near the top of my list.

Again, I'm sorry that this post got a little out of hand, I'm just stuck in this weird pickle in my life and I need some help to figure my way out. If you made it this far, thank you for actually taking the time to read it, and thank you even more if you give some advice. Every little bit is appreciated because I'm truly lost as to what to do right now.

If you have any more questions or need some specifics, feel free to ask. Again, thanks so much in advance!",college,Not sure where to go from here,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3ryd9n/not_sure_where_to_go_from_here/,1446962463.0
717,uuuuvvvv,1446356558,/r/college/comments/3r1xkq/should_i_transfer_again/,"Let me start by saying that I have had depression since high school, although not nearly as severe. Also, I am clinically depressed, depression runs in my family, and I have been on medication although it doesn't work. I started school as a freshman at a university in Pennsylvania. I was on the swim team there and I was the perfect program, a 5 year masters degree program for forensic science. I had good grades and I liked my teachers and my classes. I am also dyslexic and the classes were all small enough (less than 25 people) that I could get the help that I needed from each of my teachers. I was absolutely miserable there. I was sort of friends with the swim team and had a few other friends from my major, but I never did much with them because everyone there drank and I didn't, I mean I did not meet a single other person who did not want to drink. I think what bothered me the most though was the cold, I absolutely hate the cold. I am from Tennessee where everything closes when we get an inch of snow and schools have even closed in my hometown because it was too cold outside. I was very depressed, I thought it was the cold, and the fact that I wasn't doing well in swimming, but with a lot of help from my parents and swim coach at home, I decided to transfer schools.

Now, two and a half years later, I am in my junior year at Rice. I thought that if I could get away from the cold, I wouldn't be depressed anymore but it is worse than ever. It is hard to get out of bed most days, even to do triathlon training which I love more than anything. I am on medicine and I have seen a psychologist but nothing helps. The reason I am depressed is because I am such a failure, I have always felt like a failure but not that I am barely passing any of my classes it is much worse. I am no longer on a swim team (I found after freshman year that I am a very good triathlete so I am doing that instead) and so I do not have any friends. I have never been a social person so not being on a team that forces you to interact with people has really hurt my ability to make friends. I have tried to talk to people in my classes but I have absolutely nothing to say when I am around other people. I would honestly join a sorority just so that I would have a group of people to be friends with but they don't have that here. There is also just as much drinking and partying here as there was at my old school and I absolutely do not want to be a part of that (my uncle is an alcoholic so I am terrified of drinking and I will never drink even though I am 21 so it is legal). My grades are very bad. The classes have been incredibly overwhelming since the day I got here and I have struggled just to pass since last year. I have never been considered smart but I didn't think I was so stupid that I would fail 2 classes and get 2 other Ds. My classes are also huge. Most have well over 100 people, one class I am in has over 300, so I am not able to get the help from my teachers that I need because of my dyslexia. If I had known this before choosing this school I wouldn't have come here, but the school advertised a 6:1 faculty to student ratio and said they had a great disability support service. This school does not have a forensic science degree either.

I don't know if I should try to transfer back to my first university and just try to deal with the cold, or if I should just try to get through three more semesters here. I thought I was miserable there and that was causing my depression, but now I am just as depressed if not more here.",college,Should I transfer again?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3r1xkq/should_i_transfer_again/,1446374558.0

--pardon my grammar and English because I'm typing this at 2 in  the morning--

A little about myself: 
I am an above average student, who immigrated to America in 8th grade. I have never tried hard at school mostly because I always do good without much effort. But let's skip all that. Long story short I have the grades to go a good school but not my dream school: Stanford. 
My gpa: 3.75 out of a 4.0 scale 
SAT - 1900
ACT- 30
I don't have a lot of extracurriculars or volunteer hours either. 
So as it stands right now I'm not getting into Stanford with my credentials. 
But one of the biggest things you should know about me is that I love to challenge the impossible. The thrill to be David and beat Goliath. To be the underdog. I never feel more excited than when the odds are against me. Although I have always failed I keep trying, because why not. I have nothing to lose. 

When I told my friends ans family that I was applying to Stanford they point blank told me that I was wasting my time. Some even laughed and called me stupid and dumb. Well they are right. and trying to prove them wrong is what is motivating me to take the drastic steps I am about to take. My chances are 0%. But I am going to try anyways. 

Trying and failing is better than not trying and wondering what if. 

With that in mind, I am gonna attempt the very impossible. Get into Stanford. 
I fully expect to fail. Heck I know I am going to fail but whatever. If I don't try now, there won't be another chance to try again. 

With the deadline for the application on January 3rd I have a little over 2 months to do whatever I can and get into Stanford. 

WHATS THE PLAN!!

Raising my GPA is out of the question because it is too late, so I am going to have to rely on extracurricular activities, standardized testing and my skills as a programmer to impress the daylights out of the admissions and get into Stanford 

My first sub-goal is to get an 2300 on the SAT(another very hard goal). And you thought I was crazy to try and get into Stanford. 

I am also going to try and learn a PHP and javaScript so I can build some websites and apps so I can create a portfolio
(I already know C# and Java so should not be that hard)

I am also going to do some extracurricular activities as well.  

I am going to post weekly updates to document my progress. 

So without further delay lets get started. 

I  am going to try and get into Stanford in 2 months. 

Disclaimer: I will most likely/definitely fail. But as I said before ""whatever"" me gonna try anyways. 

Wish me luck!.",college,Average high school student trying to get into Stanford in 2 months.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3qt88k/average_high_school_student_trying_to_get_into/,1446206413.0
719,sociocalf,1445967064,/r/college/comments/3qg0wn/sinking_under_the_weight_of_selfinduced_stress/,"I'm currently a college freshmen attending a private Christian college, which was essentially academic suicide. I'd always wanted to go to a four year college, but my grades in high school were quite lacking due to depression and the diagnosis of an autoimmune illness/absences due to the medical appointments that came along with it. To my disappointment, I looked towards community college (there's nothing wrong with it, but I had my sights set on a four year university). However, at the last minute I applied to the Christian school. It was known for being a good school and academically rigorous (not a good fit for me in that regard), and I figured that if I could get accepted, I could transfer to an even better university after I had proved fantastic grades. I'm also not interested in partying, so I was cool with the idea of a dry campus.

We are now heading into the second semester and I am stressing. Because I don't have much of a religious background, I struggle with the required religious classes that most of the other students have grown up with/know the basic foundation of. I get by on my Old Testament class by studying the professor's practice quizzes that contain all of the answers, however when it came time to study for the exam, there were 8 sections to study with 200 questions each (basically the Q&amp;A on the exam were mixed in with random questions). I studied one of them but quickly realized it would be near-to-impossible to do all of them in the amount of time that I had. Everyone else I knew didn't study them at all. I ended up failing the exam, and another very difficult history exam as well. 

Because this is such a small school, the social life isn't fantastic either. I had never had any drama in high school as I'm on the quieter side, but I was already involved in drama on my third week. After the incident, I stopped talking to people, and they stopped talking to me. My only friend is my roommate who (to our surprise) also happens to not be Christian and thinks this place is just as ridiculous as I do. We pretty much are each other's only social contact, which isn't bad because we like each other and are friends, however we're isolated from everyone (much to our own doing). She is transferring after winter break and I am as well. Many of the people here are stereotypical Christians, believe that everything is a ""sin,"" etc. That's what I get for coming here, but still.

Because of all of this my motivation has dropped as my depression rises. Currently I have two essays and a project that I have not done, most of which the assignments have already been due. I'm crumbling under the stress, I know I just have to go on with it but I'm so disinterested. I know a few others who had also failed the history exam, and my roommate who has never failed an assignment in her life is failing some things in her classes also. When I think about the work load, it causes me to curl up and avoid it the more it piles up. I don't know what to do with myself. On top of all of this I have severe sleeping difficulty -- it's very difficult for me to sleep early during the night. I've always been more sleepy during the day/able to sleep better during the day for whatever reason. If I wake up before 10 am, I usually feel extremely nauseous. My college requires almost all freshmen to have an 8 am class, so I've ended up missing the class after that several times due to intense feelings of nausea during the 8 am. After I sleep it goes away, but I don't know what to do. I can't just keep not going to class and they count attendance and deduct points for not showing up.

I've decided to transfer back to community college after winter break, but I know that my mother doesn't want me to be there. She's said it's been great since I've been gone, I guess my parents aren't fighting as much and she's less stressed without me around. One of the reasons I came to this college was to get away from home because it causes me a lot of stress. Now it's all piling up on me and I feel like I'm backtracking. I tried to confide in my mother but she tells my father who will call me up and start pounding me with questions about why I'm not doing well with grades when all I really need is comfort and support to give me a better push. My mother never went to college and has a decent government job, so she doesn't understand necessarily. She didn't know much about college -- she even thought I had a similar class schedule to high school. My father didn't go to college as a kid and went later during adulthood in which he received a 4.0, so he always gives me a hard time.

Dealing with LANs for businesses and managing their IT infrastructure. I don't have a passion for this line of work, I view it as a big chore... and I don't see myself doing it as a career.

The only reason I entered the IT Program was because my Dad wants me to be this 1337 H4xx0rsz. Having hacked before, I find it very boring and child's play. So what if I can use SQL Injection to get the names of employees in a company? It's silly too because laws are so tight I can't do anything with the knowledge I'm learning without getting punished for it in some form.

I originally wanted to enter into the welding program because I welded in highschool and absolutely loved it... and welders get payed about $20+ where I live. It's simple work, with great pay, and it makes you feel good knowing whatever you do at the job, you're putting something out there in the world. 

Not so with the virtual realm. I have learned that IT is incredibly complicated, so much so it's intimidating. There are people who know a lot, who spend wakeless hours learning about the smallest tools. Some people at my college have slipped through the cracks somehow and work as support technicians, despite not knowing crap (I told IT here when my internet went out that I could ping the router, but couldn't ping 8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4 in the CMD. She stared at me like I was speaking in chinese, and asked me to try to go to google.com one 2 different browsers, facepalm). 

Another thing is that I'm concerned about how fast IT moves, it's insane. I took 2 courses that already are out-of-date. I thought it would cap out when I started school (Fall of 2014) but nope, in just a year soo much has changed!

I started Fall of 2014, invested almost 3 semesters into this program and only a semester away from obtaining my technical certificate (I was going for the associates, but GenEds would tac on an extra year), 

One of my good friends is in the Machining program and loves it; he gets to make stuff for his chopper and anything else he fancies. He got himself a job and goes to school part-time now. I wish I could do the stuff he's doing, in fact he's trying to encourage me to do it.

The only reason why I'm still stuck in this program is that a lot of stuff is easy. Real easy. Other stuff is really friggin hard, like rocket surgery hard. Linux Server Administration? No thank you, log and configuration files are not my friend.

I've tried to like this program and I think have given it a fair shot, however I smell s**t all around.

**TLDR: My dad has pumped in about $6000 of his own cash for my schooling, and expects me to be that Ub3rh4xx0r that he dreams me to be. However, I don't give a crap about computers. I hate how complicated they are when you get to the administration front. I hate how the more you learn the less you know. I don't want to go to school for the rest of my life keeping up-to-date.

If I jump ship, all my knowledge will be obsolete if I decide to return. If I stick it through, I may like it, but like I said I smell dog sh** with IT. I have little motivation to learn any more.

Some background first, I don't have a diagnosis, or anything to go on, yet I have a huge list of symptoms. I've seen numerous doctors over the years, and while a majority agree there is something wrong with me, we can't figure out what. It got so bad, it affected me mentally as well. I switched to a online school early my high school career to try and manage it. I've tried lots of things, and followed lots of advice but physically I haven't gotten better. I did mentally, my anxiety is no way near what it was. I thought I could manage college but I'm not sure.


I've made lots of friends, and I am doing all right in my classes. Except physically I'm not sure. I wake up, struggle to walk to class, struggle to focus in class, and most days I can hardly make it to my third class. I always feel sore and exhausted, after nine hours of sleep, after about 4 hours of class/study time, I come home and take about a four hour nap everyday. And even then I feel exhausted. It's making it hard to focus, and even go to class some days. My mom took me to another set of doctors recently. The first one was a rheumatologist who seemed very nice and even though he didn't think it was related to my anxiety, advised me to see my school counselor. After the 20 blood tests he ordered and a counselor visit, nothing. My blood work only showed I have chronic inflammation and my counselor did not think my anxiety could be affecting anything. I saw a gastroenterologist after that and it was awful. He spent five minutes looking at my symptoms, talked about my anxiety, and told me it was probably my mental state affecting me and left. 

I honestly don't know what to do. Everything at school has been perfect, but I don't know if I can keep doing this. I can't keep going to doctor after doctor to be told nothing. Another thing is I've discovered that it is to much for me to go to school full time and work. Which hurts me because I need to work to pay for college. I've decided to keep going to the school counselor, so I don't start going down the same path I did in high school, and I have a geneticist appointment soon.

After high school I went to a small liberal arts college quite a ways from my home. I had the option to go to a community college, but part of me wanted to ""get away"" and I didn't want to to be stuck taking only core classes at the community college. I wanted more options, I wanted to go to a new place, I wanted to have new opportunities, etc. My first year was boring. General classes overlapped my AP classes, and I was bored. I found it hard to be motivated. Now there was one Art History class I enjoyed, but it was one class out of nine. It was also only during the month or January (the college was on a 4-1-4 schedule). I didn't make many friends either. I didn't feel the professors were that special, I had plenty of great teachers in high school. I also felt really crowded, despite going a college with 3,000 students in a town of 20,000 people. I was used to going home and having silence. It seems like everyone said they had more freedom; I felt like I had less. I couldn't drive so I was mostly stuck on campus, I couldn't walk my dogs or go hiking or go swimming, things I really loved. I didn't feel like I fit in that well. A lot of people who went were pretty rich. Now I'm middle class, but I still had to work over the summer, like most of my friends from back home, but a lot of people there didn't have to work. And then there were little things. People complained about getting up ""early"" - 8 isn't that early when it takes at most 10 minutes to get to class, I had to wake up earlier for work and high school. People complained about the cat food, even though it was ranked among the best college food in the country. Even though it was a dry campus, people partied and drank way too much for me, and acted like it was the reason they were at college. Needless to say, I did not have a very good experience. Now I tried. I tried joining clubs, but never hit any emails. I met with a counselor almost every week starting in November. I talked with professors about how I felt. Over the summer I met with another counselor on a weekly basis and started taking anti-anxiety meds. I thought about transferring then. But I didn't want to feel like I was giving up. It was a good school according to the rankings and everyone I talked to about it. One professor said that she felt similarly her freshman year. She advised me to try sticking it out. She said sophomore year was better for her. So here I am. I was really happy over the summer and started really looking forward to coming back. I was really hopeful things would be different. But a few days here and my mood has plummeted. I have only has one day of classes, but I already am having trouble feeling motivated and some classes seem really hard. My concern is French, it's the introductory course, but it's entirely in French for the sake of immersion. Organic Chemistry will. I doubt be very hard, but I'm a Chem major and I'll push through. Art History seems fun and since I want to major in it too to be a Art Restorer, I will enjoy it. The most fun class will be intro to film studies, which I've always been interested in, and it's a possible minor. But this weekend sucks. I'm not eating a lot, I don't talk to a lot of people and it feels so much like it will be a repeat of last year. Maybe little better, I'll enjoy my classes a little more, but I'm worried I'll still be depressed. I don't know what to do. I want to transfer, but I'm worried it won't be that different. I can go to community college for a semester so I can at least be home, but then I have to figure out where I want to go and it's still no guarantee that I'll be happy. Maybe this year will be better. But what if it's not? What do I do?

I struggled and finally graduated college, I’m trying to get into grad school and can’t because of how bad my transcript is, and I feel I was not adequately prepared for the material. What can I do to improve my chances of furthering my education?

My father worked full time and my mom was stayed home to, I guess, teach. My home school experience was like this: from elementary- middle school, school was from 8:30-12 noon (usually), M-F. We would start out with about an hour of prayer and bible study/Max Lucado; about 30 minutes of mom reading from a history textbook; then a little math basic math; maybe some creative writing actives that were not checked for spelling, grammar, nor punctuation; then about 30 minutes of reading a Little House on the Prairie type series of books about the US history that, while based on US events, were still fictional. Occasionally we’d have our prayer and bible reading, before hitting the dollar movie theater for a non-educational movie, maybe 1/5 the times, when we wouldn’t have actual school, we would go see a play at a theater or go to an actual museum. Notice I never mentioned any science or homework. My geometry in middle school consisted of “circle the acute triangle”. My economics was saving my allowance and money from jobs. By high school, we started around 9, were done around 11. I didn’t read anything. I didn’t learn anything. I thought I was really smart and just knew it all because there was nothing else being taught to me. Why else wasn’t mom giving me something to do? I think my baking and cooking counted as chemistry. No math, still no science. My English/vocab credit throughout all of this was sending emails to my friends (with a middle school level vocabulary that was never checked nor corrected). I graduated high school not knowing the difference between their, there, and they’re; you’re and your; not knowing how to use a comma, colon, or semi-colon. I had never heard of mitochondria, didn’t know what the numbers of the periodic table meant, didn’t know gravity was a force or what a force was, I had never ever heard of RNA, I didn’t know about the quadratic formula either. That is how little knowledge I had going into college. You don’t realize how often a professor will say “now, you probably learned this in high school…” I didn’t. I didn’t learn any of it because the resources just weren’t available. We we’re poor, we lived comfortably. My mom has her masters in early childhood education, so she knows how to teach CHILDREN, not middle school or high school. 

My parents had no goals for my education. The point of them home schooling me was to keep me from learning about sex, drugs, and evolution… in Texas. We had no tests. No exams. No quizzes. Nothing that would have maybe lead me to think that maybe I wasn’t on a high school level. I always thought I was on par with my peers from home school activities and sports, because I didn’t have to do anything. I had done it all. I thought I just got it all done super-fast since I didn’t have to walk between classes. My first flag that something was wrong, that I didn’t know what I was supposed to, was when I took the THEA (TX Higher Education Assessment?) to get into college. I failed the first time (didn’t make the bare minimum for any school), and had to take it 3-4 more times just to pass the 3 parts. I finally made grades that qualified me for remedial math and English. How could I have known something was wrong before that? How can I ask what is going on in Tokyo if I’ve never heard of Japan? 

I spent 3 years, full time (fall, spring, and summer) in junior college, before moving to university for another 3 years, full time (fall, spring, and summer). I had to drop and retake all my math classes at least once. Made C’s in my remedial and college level English classes. Couldn’t pass college chemistry and finished my degree with a lower level chemistry course. Dropped and retook many other science courses. Now my transcript is a complete wreck and no university or program will touch me because they rightfully don’t want to take the risk of giving away a spot to someone who might drop out. I worked very hard to earn my 3.4 GPA overall, but it took a few tries in some classes to get a passing grade. I’ve had to drop and retake so many that I went over the 40 hour rule, which says you have to complete a degree with an excess of no more than 40 hours of what it takes to earn that degree. So, if your degree requires 60 course hours to complete, you have to complete it in less than 100 attempted hours. I went over and had to pay extra my last semester. That’s how many drops I’ve had.

I feel like I did everything right while in college: I surrounded myself with super smart friends; I didn’t go out and party; didn’t drink until 21 and even then hardly ever; I studies much harder than my friends, and most of my class mates; I read the text books; I took the class notes; I only missed 4 class days during my entire 6 years, of which 2 were for funerals, one was because I was getting an award for a paper I wrote in another class, and one was because I just wasn’t feeling well. I did everything I could, and it wasn’t enough. 

I’ve tried to get into other bachelor programs, but I only meet the 3.0 minimum for prerequisites. I tried to take a practice GRE online and broke down before I finished the first section because I just couldn’t understand the questions being asked because I just don’t have a good foundation on which my education was supposed to have been built. 

What can I do? I can’t blame mommy for my shit transcript on school applications. I can’t think of how I can spin this to a positive that I’ve come a long way since basically not knowing how to read. I can show on a graph that, despite courses getting harder, my GPA slowly went up semester by semester. I’m 26, still no career, can’t get back into school to get that career. I’m stuck. What can I do? How can I fix this? Is it possible to fix this? Is there a form I can fill out if I feel I literally learned nothing in my home school education? I don’t know what to do and could really use some help here because I am so tired of being a failure. I have a passion for science and enjoy school and learning, but I just can’t get back in. I need to not only get into another program, but I need to complete it so that I know I’m not a failure. I feel that I’ve been cheated out of life and knowledge about the world and universe and that’s what bugs me. There was all this information available and they never told me.

Almost as soon as I moved out I was in and out of the hospital with kidney stones, totaling around 20 over that time. I spent most of my time in the hospital and at home on painkillers, while I tried my best to keep up in classes. 

Nobody told me about the option of Medical Withdrawl from classes, so every semester I'd end up failing and registering again the next for the same ones. My doctors always said ""there shouldn't be another stone"" so I always had hopes to keep going to classes. Well after three semesters of that I was dismissed from the university for a poor GPA and I am currently at a community college, which left me with another year of stones, and I'm looking at third enrollment for these classes I've been trying to take for three years.

The problem now is my financial situation. A good chunk of my hospital bills were stayed by my savings which no longer exists. Some were taken care of through hospital assistance, but the rest are in collections. Now as far as I've been told, until those are out of collections (paid, not being paid), nobody will loan me money privately to go to school, even with cosigners. My poor GPA lost me all grant money, and I only get about 2000 dollars in subsidized loans which pays for less than one semester of tuition. 

I have about 15k in debt from multiple outpatient treatments, as well as an outstanding bill from university before I can go back. Do I have any other options besides quitting to work? I've been working to pay for tuition, but I cant afford tuition at a real university once I repair my GPA as I'm already struggling pretty hard to meet the payment plan as it is.

Does this even belong here? Maybe /r/finance? I'm so lost and I feel like I'm drowning while the school does things like drop me from my classes after I pay, I don't feel welcome.

It's reflecting on my transcript, too. This would technically be my 4th semester (not including summers-- started in spring '14) and I feel like I've already screwed up my transcript.

Here it is:

I tried to take Summer courses to ""balance"" out the W's on my transcript, but they ended up being too much for me to handle. Luckily I dropped them before the ""drop by"" date. By the way, W's stand for ""Withheld"".
I don't know if other schools have better policies, but my school's ""drop by"" date is literally a week and a half after courses start.


Anyway, I signed up for 4 courses for the Fall semester, and I'm feeling overwhelmed. Its almost been a full year since I've been in a school setting, and I feel like I can't ""get in the groove"" of things before classes start.

How can I get myself to relax? To prepare for this semester? Any suggestions at all? (Also, is my transcript as fucked as i think it is?)

Honestly, even though I've been taking courses for a year now, I still have no idea what I'm doing, what major I'm going for, what courses I should be taking, and what college I want to transfer to. I've just been following the basic general ed required to transfer, but I feel like that's not specific enough. /endrant",college,"Major college anxiety- Returning is hard, especially when I feel like my transcript has screwed me.

729,[deleted],1437083230,/r/college/comments/3djyfj/university_wont_let_me_declare_the_major_i_want/,"I'm currently ""undecided"" in the humanities but wanted to go into the sciences. My GPA is a 3.2. In order to do so, I have to take certain classes, which I was fine with. But I was told that I cannot take these classes for the following reasons:

1. I would not be allowed to take the math prerequisites because the humanities and sciences have different math courses. The content is identical, but the registration is different for some reason. Switching is ""very hard if not impossible"" according to academic advisers, although I've known people who have done it with relative ease. 

2. The amount of time it would take to complete a degree would be too long, apparently. It's only an extra 1-2 years more, with a grand total of 5-6 years. I've only been here for about a year. I will not go over the maximum unit limit, but I've never seen a limit for how many years I can stay at the university in any of the university's policies, unless I didn't see it (unlikely because I spent a long time looking). 

Is there really no recourse here? Everyone I've talked to at the university said that I have to accept that ""these are the rules"" and to ""give up and choose a random humanities major"". I really do not want to just settle for a humanities degree. Actually, the funny part is that when I tried choosing a humanities degree instead, they told me that I can't choose that one because the one class I need to declare the major is only available to people that already declared that major upon entry of the university. I think it's pretty fucked up that the school is literally telling me to get a degree in something that I have little interest in, even though I'm paying for it. Has anyone been through a similar ordeal? 

tl;dr: university academic adviser said the university won't let me switch from humanities to sciences, tells me that I can't take the classes required to switch because of policies (there is no specific reason in the policies that says why I can't switch), and was told to give up and choose a random major in the humanities.

730,asshat_billy,1436294404,/r/college/comments/3cgfmm/should_i_drop_out_of_law_school/,"Hi! First time poster here.

Long story short, I am a Canadian-born Hong Konger, ""internationally"" educated in Hong Kong all my life (did my iGCSEs and IB with pretty decent scores), and am going into my 2nd year of law school at the University of Hong Kong. Academically, I'm not doing too bad right now, but as much as I have tried this past year (believe me, I've tried everything!), I've had a pretty bad time fitting in.

Though I do speak Cantonese (albeit kinda badly), I find it hard to talk to locals, let alone make friends with them. Don't get me wrong, they are nice people (...for the most part), but it's so hard to relate to them. They have different priorities in life, do different things, and hang out with different people.

This isn't just a social thing. I find the overall atmosphere here very limiting. I've met a few of great friends (all non-locals), no doubt, and I hate to sound like an entitled asshole, but it's not enough. It's not letting me grow as an individual. I feel like I've hit a new low in life and I'm not moving anywhere. All the motivation I had a year ago has all but vanished. I'm even starting to lose motivation for music (my greatest passion of all). It's terribly depressing.

Law school was never my first choice anyways - It was business school. Under great pressure from the circumstances at the time, I had very unfortunately turned down an offer for Commerce at McGill for this, but I don't think I can place the blame on anyone else - Only in retrospect do I realize that I've been way too careless and ""whatever works"" from the very beginning.

I've (attempted) to talk to my (Asian) parents, and they've been overall unsupportive of my intentions to move to another school. They've essentially ignored everything I've said and pointed their fingers at me, saying I'm the problem and that I should go see a counsellor, adapt and stay at HKU. Needless to say, I was very hurt, especially by their refusal to let go of this age-old belief that HKU/Law school ""all that"", even though I've already demonstrated how much I'm suffering over here.

Even so, I do understand why they (and perhaps some of you) would think it would be crazy to drop out for another school and degree. I do see why a law degree is so highly valued. But getting the degree would do me no good anyways. My grades are too low for me to get the PCLL anyways (that's the programme that would qualify me as a legal practitioner in HK), and I never really wanted to be a lawyer anyways, let alone be stuck in HK for the rest of my working life.

So here I am, deciding whether or not to apply to transfer (or even as a first-year applicant) to business school at McGill and UofT. My top choice would be McGill, as I've heard great things about it (both from friends and research). The reasons are many: As much as I want to get out of HKU, I don't want to be a spoilt brat spending all of my parents' money - My dual-citizenship means I can get significantly cheaper tuition in Canada (compared to, say, the UK). Plus Montreal sounds exactly like what I am looking for - An opportunity to experience a diverse culture different to mine, and yet one that is congruent with my personality, and that I can relate much more easily to in terms of lifestyle, opportunities etc. Just the thought of going there excites me. I could go on and on...

I do realize that, even if I do get an offer, by the time I've transferred out of HKU, I would have made it to the halfway point of my four-year law degree. But honestly, I don't think I can make it through the second half without suffering a complete mental breakdown, especially considering how difficult it gets from here on...

I'm not asking for validation for my intentions, but I want your honest opinion on this. Tell me why I'm crazy. Tell me it's too late and I'm screwed. Tell me why I should go for it. Tell me why it's a great idea. I want to hear it all.

Thank you so much in advance. You may have saved my life, I am eternally grateful.

When I work hard (which I plan on doing) my grades are pretty much A's and B's (mostly A's) so I'm not too concerned with getting into certain colleges and not others because of grades. Also finances are not an issue.

I am interested in music. Specifically the industry, composition, musical theatre (writing for), and music education (for high school). I'm currently focusing on the industry and writing music. I understand that's a fair amount of interests and I definitely plan on narrowing it down later, probably when I transfer to a four year or just before I do. I also have a very strong interest in doing a semester abroad in Japan. Essentially I'm looking for school with a diversified music program and a strong study abroad program. I also prefer a more social college environment in or near a major metropolitan area. I currently live in a suburb in Southern California and another thing that's relatively important to me (not a deal breaker) is going someplace that has actual seasons (leaves changing and snow). I don't mind staying in California but it's not my preference. The only school I currently have in sight is Northeastern in Boston because of it's co-op program (one of it's biggest draws for me), study abroad program, and the fact that they have a music program for what I'm looking for (I'm not sure about the music education though). However from my understanding, NEU's music program isn't that strong. So if anyone can recommend some universities (anywhere in the U.S) private or public that have a strong music program and a strong study abroad program. I don't plan on going to a school without visiting it first because I know it's important to actually visit and make sure it feels right. I plan on doing that this year so I have where I want to go narrowed down and can make sure I have the classes I need to under my belt.

732,[deleted],1433479050,/r/college/comments/38mkhe/i_just_finished_my_first_year_in_college_and_i/,"I just finished my freshman year at my University. Things were going great during the first semester, never better actually. But after going through my second semester, I really can't but think of negative thoughts and be possessed by depression. Before I get to my story, some might say I am ok or why not talk to my family or friends, its just that my family never wants to talk: I have three older brothers. The one right above me in age dropped out in high school and does nothing but make fun of me most of the times. My oldest brother actually goes to a university much more known than me and he is near getting his master's degree in bio-med engineering; He never takes me seriously and forces himself to listen to me and always ends up telling me to ""figure it out on my own."" My parents never before in my life asked me about my grades. I am a very responsible person and they always believe that I will do my best and that I will do well. My friends are the type who really cannot connect emotionally with others that are hurt; they just arent the talking to type.

This is my story: 
I was born in the U.S. Up to the age of 10 (fourth grade) I was not good in school (C's mostly). I then moved to my country (Palestine). Here, I learned a new language and went to a school that was pure arabic language. I did not know how to write or read so it was challenging, but I worked harder than ever. 5th grade, my average was 78 (no such thing as gpa there). 6th grade, average was 85, 7th grade, my average was 93 and I was third in my class. 8th, 9th, and 10th grade, my average was 96 and I was first in my class at the time. I couldn't have been happier. 

I moved back to the U.S and attended high School for 11th and 12th grade tackling some AP courses and attaining a 4.0 gpa both years. I applied to a University and got in.

Its the first semester in college, obviously I was too nervous. I am a student majoring in chemistry to pursue a career in dentistry (Always loved chemistry deeply with my heart). The first semester was challenging indeed but rewarding. I was able to get a gpa of 3.91 (I was taking 4 courses and one lab. I received A's in all of my classes and only a single A- in my English course. The courses were Calculus 1, General chemistry 1 and lab, English 1, and a general education course). I couldnt have been any more happier in my life. One of the most memorable accomplishments of mine during this semester was with my first exam in college: it was a chemistry exam. Out of my lecture of 350 students, my professor pointed out that one student received a perfect score, and that student was me. That day gave me the confidence I needed to move on and press forward. I have never been happier, really I enjoyed my winter break with to my heart's content because I deserved it.

Then my second semester started, Something about this semester was just totally off. I felt like I was going to do bad somehow. The courses I took this semester were the following: Calculus 2, General Chemistry 2, English 2, Biology 1, Bio lab and chem lab. My biggest concern was biology. I simply suck at biology and the rumors about biology one at my university were brutal (30% pass rate, horrible department, bad professors, disorganized, weed out course). I didnt believe any of them but they were all true. To begin with, my first chemistry exam the second semester got me a 89/100. This put me down way too much because I expected more of what happened the first semester honestly. But this worry became nothing when i started biology. The course was horrible and disgusting in every way, especially the lab. It was the worst experience ever. No matter how much I tried in that course, I could never get things right. My first exam was a 66 (this was the first exam I ever failed.) My second exam was a 79 and final was 71. I couldnt get myself to do well in this course no matter how much I tried. I spoke with the professor a lot for advice but to no avail. I am a mathy person; chemistry and calculus were natural to me but biology was just hell. What made it worse is that all my friends were doing well and I was the only one behind. Furthermore, I always hated the fact how I could help others with things like math because math is a process, but I didnt know how to get help in biology. I was the only chemistry major in my entire biology lecture and it was just devastating to see my end result. 

In the end of this semester, I got a B- in biology and an A- in English 2. I have to admit, my grades came out midnight and I was literally heartbroken. My gpa was 3.58 for the semester ((was knocked off of deans list). I was the friend who was the ""smart"" one everyone believed in and everyone always told me not to worry because Im smart and all. But I always told them I am not. Although I should be happy, it really hurt to see all my friends do better than me this semester. 2 of my friends didnt take biology and ended up with 3.9 gpas. Two other friends who took biology and similar courses to me ended up with 3.3 and 3.65 gpas. It was extremely hard for me to bring up my grades to them. 

After getting such a low gpa, I feel as though the career I intend to pursue in dentistry is just fading away. I currently have a 3.74 gpa and I have a bad feeling it is going to get lower because classes are just getting harder. It really hurts me that I have no one to talk to, and I never got a gpa below 3.8. people tell me that gpas go up just as easy as they go down, but that is no where near true after doing some calculations. I had this big fear when I entered college, that something like this would happen. I told myself I must focus on getting a high gpa to start with so that it becomes too heavy to bring down later on. But now, I feel like I am going no where. 

To top things all off, I was late applying for volunteer opportunities and community service events involving dentistry to get my hours in because I am inexperienced with volunteer work, making me not so worthy of a future applicant. When I tried to shadow/volunteer at my local dentists, I was turned down because they have new trainees. 

I just wish there was something to put me back on my feet. This semester's gpa just brought me down too much. I have no more desire to eat as much, I can't sleep, and just thinking of my friends who are better off than me and knowing things are getting tougher later on are just making things worse. The biggest thing I am known for all around my friends, peers and teachers, is that I am the most hardworking student they have ever met. I consider this the only smart part about me. But what kills me is when people tell m I deserve this break, because I feel I really don't.

I am extremely sorry for the long post. I just wanted to let it all out and have something to say to someone willing to listen. Thank you so much.

733,Edd091,1433137690,/r/college/comments/381r4o/my_full_experience_at_pensacola_christian_college/,"The dorm life for me, as I stated before was rough. It was new for me, since I never been in a dorm in my life. I would soon learn that it takes time and patience to get used to it. So two of my roommates, who were seniors, were actually popular. Yes, they were well known thought out the school. And that's something I should've looked at, becuase I'm the kind of person who doesn't like a lot of attention. Anyway, I would soon learn that not everyone follows the rules. You see, music is a BIG thing at PCC. There's certain things we aren't allowed to listen to and certain things we are allowed to listen to. And to make sure that they actually montired music, there are no headphones allowed. And I literaly took these rules seriously. I left my mp3 and my headphones at home, and I'm thinking they follow the rules. But a few weeks later, one of the roomates brings an apple computer and installs it with speakers, and the next thing, he's just BLASTING it! And man, most of the music he listened to was way aganist the rules! But you know something, the rooms was right next to the ice room. So you know what that means? No one can hear it. They were smart and knew it all too well. And the other roomate was doing it as well! He installed speakers on his bed and jammed out to is music that was aganist the rules as well. So, I'm thinking, wow. I guess most people break the rules. And it turns out, most of the guys on the floor did. And no one cared. So, that's when I started to break the rules also. You can read more about it on my post. But I was like, wow. These guys are well known in the college, they have so much knowledge from the bible, and they break rules too? To me, it didn't make any sense. Anyway, another thing that was a big pet peeve, was sleeping. You see, since they were both ""Well known"", people just popped in. Yeah, even at night as well. And yeah, when I was sleeping as well. And to me, that was just so rude. They actually had no respect for people who were trying to sleep, espically people who had to go to work or to rest for a big test. And yes, I figured out that they were basically in charge of the dorm, and I had no final say whatsover. I tried to talk to them but they just didn't budge. I also DID try to move to another room, but It didn't work out. So, I stuck with it. Even my other roommate and I had frequent talks in private about how they don't give any consideration to us. But hey, that's how college life is. From sleeping to sharing the bathroom was a huge struggle. I'm not saying I don't like them, I do. In fact, we are good friends. But it's the other things I didn't like. It was just rude.

I pretty much explained a lot of things on my other post, so I won't put it on here. But I have a interesting stories that will blow your mind. And yes, I was there.

My friends and I were out of campus just to go somewhere to eat. Sometimes the food just gets too old. But yeah, as we were driving, one of my friends forgot his wallet. He was worried like crazy. Why, because he had ""Condoms"" in it. Yep, apprently this guy has sex with the college girls, and they are stirct about it. He found his wallet and didn't get in trouble, but seriously. He needs to be careful, because the moment he gets caught, all his hard work there would be a waste if he gets kicked out.

Oh yeah, there was a girl I liked brielfy, but she's just a baby, fresh out of high school. I also prefered girls around my age lol.

One thing I want to talk about is the ushers there. They recently posted an article about them, and explain how they take their job seriously and stuff like that. It also explains how they set a positive example for the service, which is not always the case. I had experiences where a usher just told me to sit at a spot coldly. Yes, they are professionals, but I feel most of them have favorites. Yeah, since they are made up RA's, they only talk to the popular crowd. Most RA's are popular, since they have a big role. I even saw an usher in one event just going back and talking to a hot spanish girl. But yeah, not all are like that. I knew one who was cool and had no problems with. But some of them just have a cold attitude. I think they get it from their cold bosses.

I had a situation I think I can describe as discrimation. In chapel, it was the last quarter of the semester, and I was sitting next to a white girl. And all that time, she never looked at me, she never spoke to me, and she only moved if I was getting into the seat. So, she couldn't talk to me, but she could talk to a girl, who was asian. Yeah, I could feel a lot of tention. And yes, I can personally say that PCC has rasicm inside. Yes. Even christians can discrimate.

I feel that the interantionals are more friendly, since they are from another country. In fact, I was friends with a lot of them. I felt that I could bond with them more than us Americans.

Oh yeah, the elevators. Everytime someone goes to the secnd floor, people always complain. And yeah, I had a guy get mad at me one day, while I was going to class. Honestly, I wanted to say that I pay to be here just as you. But then that would get into an argument, and I don't like to waste time arguing. But after a while, I just brush it off when I have to go to the second floor.


Yeah, I pretty much explained my experiences. But I want to share one last thing. It's how I was treated that lead me to withdraw from the college. You see, prior to going back, I was in a deep situation. So, I wrote a letter explaining everything. Fortunantly, they responded, but not in the manner that I wanted. I remember getting a call from student life, saying that someone wanted to speak to me. So, I went there and spoke to Dr.Ohman. He told me he read the letter and looked at my situation, but told me that there was nothing they could do. And he did it in a way where it was stone, cold hearted. I've seen him speak during a chapel service once, and thought he was this perosn who cared for the student body. Wrong. He's just there to enforce the rules. And that's what he was doing. Just sitting there in his office, him staring at me and looking at me with coldness, it didn't feel good. The ""love"" they always talk about wasn't anywhere near this man. I mean, if he told me in a more lighter way with understanding, then I would take that. But that wasn't the case. So, After that, I knew the college wasn't the place for me anymore. Aside from the fact that It's not accredited, most people really don't care. So I knew I had to leave. I actually stayed for a few more days, trying to work it out, but they stuck with their rules.

734,Zutch,1431951115,/r/college/comments/36d0of/university_student_meltdown_long_post/,"Hello everyone,First of all i would like to that this is my first reddit post, although i have been using reddit for a while,But never posted anything myself.

I seek your advice and your opinion on a personal academic matter that i just cannot contain by myself,I have tried seeking professional help in my university but it was of no use .

My problem is, I am a university student in undergraduate Electrical and Electronic Engineering program, i am 22 years old, and theoretically i am supposed to graduate in 2 semester but in reality am setback at least 2 years.

I am and Introvert by nature, i live alone in 1+1 apartment after living in dorms with roommate(s) for  2 years, i never did drugs or gambling or clubbing,i am a rather quiet person who likes a cup of tea and a good movie in a friday night, on paper this sounds like a nice profile for a scientific path as engineering, but as i revealed, i have setback myself 2 years in progress in my program. and i am at a breaking point of frustration.

My parents know nothing of my situation, i study in a foreign country, far away from my parents, they finance my education and life, so i don't work or get money from the government, another point that'd make engineering choice more appealing to become successful, but i have proven otherwise.

You might wonder by now, then What the heck did you do? seem's like a good life. 

Well i messed up, in my first semester of uni, i didn't take my courses seriously, i was busy with the new thriving social life i had, i had my freedom to play video games as i will, and i had such a blind ego that i kept telling myself, god won't let me fail i am good servant of his.

First semester over, i repeated 4 courses out of 5 (got an A in english...the irony)
i was shocked, i was in tears, here my world started falling apart, in days i am expected to call my parents and tell them the good news of my successful first semester. 

Saddened by my failure, and fear stricken by the reaction of my parents and what their punishment would be (i was afraid they'd disown me or force me to come back home and switch to lesser study field ) once i tell them the exact opposite of their expectation, i decide to hide the truth, lie, so i foraged fake grade report and emailed it to my brother to show them my grades. my family believed it, and were so pleased, i told my self, you messed up the first time you will make up next semester and tell your family the truth, a semester passes by, yet i repeat 2 more courses (math/physics), i was mortified, out of fear and embarrassment i decided to keep lieing to my parents until the foretold day of my redemption of my grades, the day i set straight what once was wrong .

Fast forward... it's 2015 and i yet look back at those 3-4 years,  and i am filled with sadness how i let my ego take over me through all these years, during those 3-4 years i let myself indulge in video games as an escapism of my failure and disappointment, i dropped my social life, kept lieing to my parents, and kept getting sadder and sadder day by day from my failure. like a self inflicting cycle of despair while repeating courses.

During those years, my religiousness was sliding down drastically, i started questioning my religion, i started reading and watching Richard Dawkins series and other Atheist speakers debunk religion and advocate reason and logic, i was filled with rage, how could i have been blinded for so long. i relied on my superstition to  set things right while i sat idle.

I saw one of my good friends whom we started together, graduate with highest honor, i was so sad that day, i knew i could've been as good as he did, but instead i choose bad road, a selfish one, and i paid the price for it.


i am a different person now, i am agnostic and more accepting and open minded, i support and respect many things i haven't before. i have learned and realized so much through my despair .


But i am tired now, the lie is consuming me, it scorned my mind , it alienated my parents away from me, my mom just called me asking me to come home and visit them, but i refused... i refused because whenever i come back, i'd feel so much guilt with every fake smile when my parents congratulate me for my fake grades, so guilty of my cowardliness to speak the truth and face the consequence, i'd feel more depressed then ever, that i created this happiness for them, and the sadness that i will inflict on them once they know all these years of lies and deceit ...

My best friend since kindergarden abandoned me and wished death upon me once i told him about my agnostic uprising, although he was the only one who i'd go to vent off my problems (he studies in a different country ).


But, despite all of this, i never thought of ending my life, even after dropping my religion, i felt even more responsible, and more compelled to keep on, it's not over, am 22 and i am yet to live my life, but i am filled with a burden that just weighs me down so hard... like a large stone set against my chest...difficult to breath and live...



Now you might wonder how could i let myself fuck up this hard, to be truely honest, i do not know, as i stated i am not drug addict or alcoholic ( although i tried Wine out of curiosity during my religious rebellion ), i don't go to clubs or do crazy things...

You might also tell me that many engineering is just not the right thing for me, i disagree, i love science and technology, i read more about technology more than i ever read anything in high school , i love science and innovation, but ...i do not know how did i let myself astray for so long.


For this i seek your advice, i am sorry for the 5.5k~ words but i wanted to vent, keeping secrets is truly an agonizing thing. 


Thank you ..So much for your time.

735,collegethrowaway513,1431506509,/r/college/comments/35t7fb/its_4_am_and_i_have_an_exam_tomorrow_could_really/,"I know you guys see these posts all the time, but I have another ""I have below a 3.0"" sob story to bring you and I could use some honest advice. 

I'm a really, really terrible student. I'm the sort of person that, halfway through college I'm still just straight up not showing up or not doing homework (and double majoring in math and philosophy no less, so huge portions of my grades rely on it). Even if I do homework, sometimes I'll take a 0 before I turn in an assignment that I haven't completed. It's the same thing with quizzes (another large portion of the grade): if I feel I am shaky on material I will sometimes just not go rather than do poorly. This has resulted in a 2.7 GPA that has been absolutely all over the place, and frankly I'm surprised it's even that high. Obviously, I recognize the faults in these behaviors, and those times when I am consistent studying I can achieve good results. Sometimes the late nights studying will pay off in the most ridiculous ways and I'll get an A on a 20 page paper that was supposed to take weeks in only a night of work, or be near the top of a curve on a calculus test because I stumbled across the fountain of youth of studying strategies. Inevitably, these situations have become farther and farther away from each other, and I've never been so aware of that until now. Those are the things I can change.

What I'm afraid I can't change, is two-fold:

1. I'm a second semester sophomore whose semester is finishing up, and I'm **horrifically** far behind in my Linear Algebra class. I missed about two and a half weeks of school because of an abscess in my throat (as often as I fool myself into thinking I'm actually sick, you'd think I would have been more capable of dealing with actually being sick). I kicked my ass to get caught up on the midterm that I got pushed back to the week I expected to recover, and probably would have done decently well had I not gotten a bad sinus infection that Monday (and I want to reiterate that these are not feigned illnesses nor excuses to miss class; I wish I had been able to take the exam). My professor told me that I could take the final as my midterm, resulting in the final being worth a whopping 45% of my grade. In the meantime, I did very little to stay caught up. I attended class, but I only did about half of the homework assignments and missed at least one quiz. I kept pushing my studying back, and even when started it was always late at night and I was incapacitated with exhaustion the next day. I didn't request a leave of absence, I didn't go to office hours, I fucking missed a makeup quiz, and dropped probably my easiest class a yet inexplicable reason. All of the opportunities I had to rectify or postpone this semester (at least as far as this class are concerned) are gone. I might be able to scrape a C in the class, but if I do I won't deserve it at all. Any suggestions regarding cramming/anything related to walking into an exam worth 45% of one's grade completely unprepared would be welcome. This is a class I've taken before (though, granted under an extremely poor teacher and I retook it not because I didn't pass but because I felt I didn't learn anything), and is a class that I need to get a C or higher in to earn my major.

2. Every single time I approach finals season I find myself in this dilemma. I realize how fucked I am and what a terrible student I am, generally whipping myself into a first class frenzy instead of taking what time I have left to study. When I end up passing with mediocre to poor grades (I've been sitting at a B- average the entirety of my time at college), I swear that I'll do the right thing the next semester. And I do know what the right thing is, it just never ends up getting done. At this point in my college experience, when I've halfway determined how this is all going to turn out (excepting summer classes or additional years - which I'll get to later), it's obvious that this is no longer an easy thing to convince myself of. As crass as I've come off in this post, I've frankly been more down in the past couple of weeks than I have in a very long time. My room's a mess, I don't really have any food to eat, I don't hang out with my friends very often. I just inefficiently study and sleep. I really know I can do it, because there are long moments when I've tried hard and done well. But I just don't, again and again. I'm so embarrassed that I've backed myself into a corner of lies to my friends and family and they don't know how poorly this is all going, and I can't even tell my therapist (whom I've continued seeing since I started seeing her last year because of some drug abuse) because it's like speaking it makes it more true. 

It's true that this semester was unusually difficult for me because of pledging a fraternity, initially working almost 28 hours (another instance of me actively choosing to do something extremely difficult - my parents just said that I had to get a job and I picked hard labor in warehouse at nearly 30 hours a week), getting very sick and staying that way for a while, but even though I tell myself that and have told my mom that this semester won't go well because of that, I know that the underlying issue is that I'm ultimately not a good student. What's more, my laziness turns into really awful self-hatred and manic motivation that leads me to go up to 48 hours on only a few hours of sleep. 

Almost done, after a very lengthy post. I'm lucky enough to be going to a good school that my parents are paying for completely. Summer classes and extra years are on the table financially (and the two summer classes I've taken have resulted in some of my more successful classes), though obviously this would be something I'd like to avoid. Both my mom and my dad have doctorates and very highly value education, though my dad went through a similar experience his freshman year. They're very supportive and I would suspect my mom has an idea of what's going on, but despite the financial capability  they have my overriding feeling is guilt that I'm flushing this all down the toilet. 

Obviously, this is a complex issue and in retrospect I don't know if I would read through a post this long. I'd be extremely grateful to anyone with any sort of advice, anecdote, or outright criticism. Please be honest with me reddit, because I've gotten to the point where I don't even know how to be honest with myself.

I'm a junior in high school at Niles West and I'm in a bad situation. I am a semi-hardworking student with good grades most of the time, but this year has been the plight of my schooling. I have a 3.2 unweighted GPA, but a 3.7 GPA weighted GPA since I take Honors and AP classes (no regular besides freshman year). I usually average a B, and that's without trying my hardest. I know I can get an A if I tried as hard as I possibly could. That's not the problem however. Last semester (I'm in my second semester), I finished very poorly. I got a D in AP Physics, a C in AP U.S. History, a C in Pre-Calculus, and everything else A and B. My GPA fell to a 3.7 because of that semester. This semester looks like the same situation. I have a D in AP Physics, a C in AP U.S. History, a C in FPC, and a C in my gym class because of stupid app-related issues that determines my whole grade. Everything else is A and B. I am also an all year round athlete (Cross Country in the fall, Track &amp; Field in the winter and spring), but I didn't do Track &amp; Field this year at all (I did Cross Country and I dropped my best times - nothing record-breaking though). I plan to continue sports next year as well. So you might be thinking, my gosh, two D's and a lot of C's? Good luck, you'll need it. The problem is that I've had the worst year of home life this year. I come home stressed from academics and my relationship to be verbally abused sometimes or to watch my parents scream at each other, with my nine year old sister watching or listening, or both. My mother cries to herself in the dark so we don't see, but we always do (my sister and I that is), and I go to school only to constantly get reminded of my terrible home life, and this happens everyday. I ended up telling my physics teacher about it and now I am going to receive counseling for this issue. Does Loyola care? Would they understand? I plan to take more AP classes next year to redeem myself to show them  who I really am. Please help me; and be honest. I don't want to create false hopes.

Edit: I didn't take any AP exams this year due to financial problems and no confidence in my scores due to grades and home life. I'm scared that will also screw me over. ",college,I'm freaking out.

738,collegethrowaway126,1430682160,/r/college/comments/34qvf1/psych_major_transferring_to_better_college/,"Once upon a time, I was a Psych major at a crappy university. After two years of hard work in the Honors College, I got good enough grades to transfer to University of Michigan, which has always been my dream school. I'm transferring there this Fall, and everything's set up: housing, enrollment deposit, registration appointment, etc. 

I used to have an attitude of, ""I don't want to work just to get rich. Money just corrupts people. All I want is to be financially secure in a job that I enjoy."" So, my plan was to go to graduate school to become a psychologist. I know that most people who major in Psych don't go on to work in the field, but assuming I maintained my GPA, getting into grad school would have been easy for me. The entry level salary for a clinical psychologist is $63,581, after getting the necessary PhD for that job. 

Now, I enjoy psychology, or at least, I love reading about it. I have no idea if I'd enjoy working with clients, although I always thought I would, since I like helping people and I'm very sympathetic to those suffering from mental illness. But I don't know if $63,581 is a sum worthy of spending five extra years in school for. My family pays for my undergrad and will do what they can to pay for my grad school, but even if it doesn't put me in debt, I don't like the idea of putting that type of burden on my family so that I can make an okay sum of money in a career that I have no idea if I'll actually like. 

So, enter the idea of majoring in computer science. It never crossed my mind when I first started school, but I've since met some people majoring in that area, and they don't seem to be burning the midnight oil every night. I mean, they'd all agree that it's a lot of work, but it doesn't seem to me that getting average grades as a computer science major is more difficult than maintaining a 3.8 as a psychology major. Still, this was always just an idea in the back of my mind... until I got into U of M, looked on the website for their computer science program, and discovered that the starting median wage for someone graduating with a B.A. in that program from this university was $85,000 a year. 

$85,000 a year. 

In other words, upon graduation, I would make just $15k less than my own father who's been working his whole life. I would make almost 2x as much as the average American. I would make $20k more than if I spent five more years of my life (not to mention my father's money) getting a PhD in clinical psychology. And that's just the starting wage. It would only go up from there. I realized that my prior attitudes about not wanting to get rich were partially related to the fact that I knew it was unlikely I'd ever make more than $100k a year (and partially related to the fact that a lot of rich people I met were assholes). Now that I've gotten into a better school, I have a lot more opportunities, and I'd like to make the most of them. 

I don't know shit about computer science, but apparently ""Ninety-six percent of students in our EECS 183 course have NO computing background or very little – they have seen but have not written code. We start at the very beginning and cover it one step at a time."" I have no clue if I'd enjoy a career in tech, but I also have no clue if I'd enjoy a career in psychology, because reading about mental health isn't the same as actually conducting therapy sessions. I'm not exactly a techy person (always considered myself a more right-brained individual), but that might just be because I've never tried to learn. 

It will take longer to graduate, but the same is true for my Psych major. Only three, possibly four, of my Psych classes will transfer. The average time it takes to complete this computer science major is 2 semesters for the prereq's and 3 semesters for the major, which means I'd be graduating in three more years... which was the amount of time I thought I'd spend getting a Psych major, anyway. The issue is, I need to decide now, and I'm a little scared. 

So, a few questions. Feel free to only answer the ones you feel like answering, or just blurt out any information that you think would be useful to someone in my position.

1) Is changing majors because I can make more money while putting in fewer years of schooling a good idea, even if I'm less passionate about the subject?

2) Do computer science majors at competitive schools have to burn the midnight oil every night just to get B's and C's?

3) Should I just minor in computer science? What benefit would that have if I still plan on becoming a clinical psychologist? 

4) Will I encounter sexism in tech, or is that just a myth?

5) What are the chances of hating my career if I go into tech?

739,collegeopinions,1429145554,/r/college/comments/32r1u1/my_freshman_year_has_sucked_tremendously_advice/,"Hey everyone. As the title of this post says, my freshman year has sucked. 

Let me start from the beginning:

I'm a homebody, so moving away from home (my university is actually only 30 mins from my house) was tough for me. I expected that. However, I had a really hard time adjusting SOCIALLY. I'm a friendly person, I socialize often, casual drinker, etc. I never thought I was ""weird"" in high school. I was, however, really shy when I got to campus. I felt really isolated, too.

First problem: My roommate is INSANE. She tracks my schedule and classes and has severe OCD. She's a huge introvert and in the beginning of the year when I wanted to meet the people in our hall and socialize she said no. So, I felt kind of weird knocking of people's doors (no one else was, that I had seen) and I was so out of my element. Because of this, I just stayed in my room. Huge mistake on my part.

Second problem: My dorm is near the gym and there is a huge amount of athletes in my hall. They are notorious at my university for being sort of antisocial. They cliqued off really quickly. (Not sure if that's a phrase, but I'm going with it.) Anyway, no friendliness in my hallway.

Third problem: On our first day with my hall my RA performed no icebreakers or anything. We went around saying our names and then our RA was like, ""Guys, I don't give a shit. I'm not going to bust you for drinking, and if you are going to do drugs, let me know first so I can give you advice. Chances are that I have done it."" HUGE culture shock for me, there. 

Fourth problem: Culture shock sprouting from the fact that the kids at my university are extremely wealthy. As a whole they are pretty entitled. I was also raised by conservative parents (not politically, more socially) and it's a huge transition to go from a conservative environment to one that is so liberal. 

ANYWAY, I'm really lonely here. I've gone through depressive episode and have even considered taking a leave of absence from school because I can't handle the environment. (I should mention it's academically rigorous, too, so academics have been a huge stressor for me.) I feel like a failure because somehow my entire college experience so far has been screwed up. I never thought I would spend the weekends in my room without anyone to hang out with. I have tried to go out more, but the people I am friendly with don't want to go. I ask them if they want to go to an event and they say no. 

So, I feel kind of lost. Whenever I talk to people about my problems, they say i got really unlucky with some things (people in my hall, roommate, RA, etc), but I really want to fix this situation I'm in. How do I make friends? Can I make friends my sophomore year, or are people sort of closed-minded by then?

Sorry this is so long-winded. It may not make too much sense. I've been feeling sort of down about this and needed advice. Thanks, y'all.


TLDR: My freshman year has not gone the way I had hoped at all socially. It's been a huge transition for me, and I don't feel comfortable yet.

741,DerivedIntegral115,1428634899,/r/college/comments/322tdv/purdue_vs_georgia_tech_for_computer_engineering/,"So I'm currently facing the hardest decision of my life.  I've been accepted into the engineering programs at Purdue, Georgia Tech, UF, Michigan, Carnegie Mellon, and Rice, and I hope to major in computer engineering.  I have ~120k in my college fund and I get no aid anywhere except Purdue, where I got a 16k per year merit scholarship.  This basically puts me at 0 debt for UF (in-state), 0 for Purdue, ~60k at Georgia Tech, and ~120k for the other schools.  I threw out the three expensive schools because despite them all being fantastic schools, their advantages over the cheaper options don't justify the price.  I've basically narrowed my options to Purdue and Georgia Tech, as I think those offer the best opportunities for their respective prices.

Overall, I personally liked Georgia Tech more when I toured.  I've always wanted to live in a city, and Georgia Tech is in the heart of Atlanta.  It's also relatively close to home and has a much friendlier climate.  The campus is absolutely beautiful, and I love the modernistic vibe I get from their buildings.  It also seems like Georgia Tech has a more highly regarded computer program, so I would probably have more career opportunities.  Tech also has a more developed co-op/internship program, which I'm extremely interested in.  From what I've gathered, it seems Tech students are also on the geekier side, and I feel like I would fit in better.  Not to mention the fact that my best friend is going there, so I'd already know one person.  The whole school just feels right to me.

But that's not to say I don't love Purdue as well.  I've been accepted to Purdue's honors college (still waiting to hear from Georgia Tech on that), so I'm guaranteed housing in Shreve hall for my freshman year and the brand new hall my sophomore year.  If review sites can be trusted, Purdue has better dorms and food.  It also has happier students (again, if review sites can be trusted).  Even though I've survived four years of IB and I'm not afraid to work hard, I do somewhat fear The Shaft at Tech... I think I would have a bit more free time at Purdue, but honestly the difficulty of the engineering programs are probably about the same.  A big plus for Purdue is their absolutely amazing performing arts programs, especially their phenomenal marching band.  Band and choir are my primary extracurricular interests, and Purdue is better for that.  However, Georgia Tech's music programs seem extremely fun and they're probably a bit less of a time commitment.

I'm really looking for a chance to get the college experience and have fun while also being prepared to become an innovator in computer technology.  The male to female ratio at Georgia Tech does concern me, but since it's in Atlanta with Georgia State and Emory right around the corner, I'm not too worried about the dating scene.  Overall I think both schools would offer a great college experience, and I'll have a great time no matter where I go.

I definitely prefer Georgia Tech over Purdue.  Location, expected fit, opportunities, climate, everything just feels right about it.  But, is this step up worth the price gap?  Purdue's still an absolutely amazing school with its own benefits.  I've been attempting to reason out this decision for a week now since I toured Purdue, and I've tried everything from pro/con lists to quantifiable ranking systems.  Georgia Tech always comes out a little bit ahead, even with price considered, but I just feel like I would be an idiot to reject the amazing offer Purdue has given me.  Yellow Jacket or Boilermaker, White and Gold or Black and Gold, I've been racking my brain and the decision's been driving me insane.

I am not ready for this. I'm not so worried about jobs, etc -- I'm a good student, I've worked a full time job already, and my skill set in my discipline is advanced. I know this aspect will work out somehow.
I feel like my whole life is going to get uprooted. Maybe I can move back home -- but I don't want to live with my parents (even though I love them very much, I just feel like I couldn't adjust to it again after having lots of freedom). And even if I did move back home expecting to reestablish a social group with my friends from high school, there's no guarantee of that either.
I could move to my college town. Some people who I know who already graduated are still there. But very few. Most of my friends are actually in the underclasses, and I feel like it would be a ""peaked in college"" situation if I just kept returning to hang out with them. Not unheard of, I'm sure, but odd --
I've heard dating after college is a nightmare. Part of the reason I mention timidity is because I feel as though I'm expected to be able to talk to people in bars, and I'm not even interested in that kind of interaction.
I just feel like my community is about to be ripped out from under me -- I have so many good memories and good friends here. And I'm always surrounded -- absolutely inundated -- by the potential to meet new people.
I've considered the Peace Corps. I would be surrounded by people I'm associated with.
Even if it's by obligation, because sometimes that's necessary for me to meet people.
I've tried to get involved in the alternative music scene, esp. hardcore in this area, but its hard to meet people (sub question: any tips on meeting people in a music scene?).
It feels like a lot of misery is incoming. And then (in an instance of catastrophic thinking surpassed by no living human, he says:) even if I make friends, it's not going to be the same dynamic where we don't really have to plan. Or is it?
I don't know. I'm sure at some level I just need to be told everything will be alright, but I'm extremely anxious about this. I feel like, even by writing this, I just wasted precious time at this place.
Thanks everyone. Will possibly update because I have so much about this that causes me anxiety in individual ways. Alllsoooo this is really long sorry thanks bye

743,[deleted],1427782306,/r/college/comments/30wd48/is_college_for_me/,"Hi guys, I'm looking for a bit of advice. I'll give a short summary of what has happened that makes me question whether academic life is really for me, and any answers are really appreciated.

I started off college as a freshmen two years ago in the fall semester really strongly, I had a GPA of 3.2, liked all my classes, passed all of them with B's, and was confident in what I was doing.

Christmas break happens, and next semester things start going weird. I lose my discipline, and fail and have to withdraw from one class, and barely get by with some borderline C grades in three others.

Summer break, I work hard at my job and feel like I'll do a lot better next semester. To make it short, I failed three out of four classes, and got a solid B+ in my final class, which was ironically the hardest. I had no idea what happened, but resolved to try again next semester, this one.

This semester has been the worst, I only took three classes this semester to see if a reduced workload would help, and I've seriously tried to fix what I felt was wrong, but my GPA now stands at 2.02 and I might have to withdraw from all my remaining classes because of bad grades. 

I've lost weight, feel depressed enough to make me stop getting out of bed in the morning for class, and am an utter failure at this. I wanted to transfer out of my school, which is an engineering college, to one that specializes more in social science or business, but with my GPA dipping below 2.00 following this I'm afraid I can never make that happen. Is it even worth it for me to continue with college and academic life at this point, or would I be better off pursuing other professional career interests that do not require a degree?

I was already constantly bullied, so I kind of hid from school in general because I live in a small town and everyone knew about my mom. My dad was a drug addict, and the only real stable adult in my life was my grandfather. Because I was constantly hiding in the barn at our school, I graduated with a relatively low GPA, 2.85. My SAT score was 1,710 with over 500 on each subject. I managed to get into a state university here in Texas, Texas State at San Marcos. My sister talked me into it because she was attending there, so I attended even though I knew it was a party school and I wasn't the party type.

First semester, I got hit with a bombshell. My grandfather was diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer. As he was the only stable adult in my life, I was visibly shaken. That matched with how poorly I was doing with associating with my peers drove me into a downward spiral. I failed most of my classes. The second semester, he got a very risky and complicated surgery that took months to recover from. I spent that time driving back and forth from Brownsville, Texas to San Marcos, Texas and back. I wound up attempting suicide and leaving school a month early.

I tried to keep going because I heard if you stop school, you'll never get back. I was also getting a lot of pressure from the family to keep going since my sister was expelled from school for reasons not relating to mine. So, I attended the local community college.

However, at the time, my mom lost her job and my grandfather was swindled out of all his retirement money. So, I wound up having to work and my grades slipped. 

Basically, my first two years went down the drain and now I have a horrible record. I want to try enrolling in a school again as a Freshman, but in Texas you have to provide all previous school records- even if you didn't get credit. Because of this, I'm having a hard time starting anywhere in the state of Texas.

Does anyone know of any schools outside of Texas that offer low income family tuition for out of state students? Oh, if it helps, I'm currently undecided but I'm considering the following: Graphic Design, Education, Architecture, Law or Veterinary.

I'm only twenty, and I feel like I've been forced out of school because of my family situation. One of the reasons I want an out of state college is so I can cut ties with them for however long it takes for me to get going.

746,rockandrollsores,1426726616,/r/college/comments/2zj9c8/stressed_about_college_scholarships_and_the_future/,"Not sure if I'm posting in the right place, but I'm not sure where else to go.

A bit of backstory: Highschool senior, graduating in less than three months, and I haven't even begun preparing for my future in education. I think I was rejected from my dream college (University of North Carolina at Asheville), the first letter they sent requested my transcripts after my first semester as a senior was completed. Filled out the transcript request sheet in our guidance office, and never heard anything back. I assume this was due to my shit grades my freshman and sophmore years. (That's another story for another post though, but long story short, going to school with someone who sexually assulted you makes it hard to focus in school.) I was accepted in to University of South Carolina Upstate. When people ask where I've been accepted, apparantly it doesn't look good on me, as an Advanced Placement and Honors student, to say ""Oh, USC Upstate."" People turn up their noses and go back to looking at their College od Charleston, Clemson, and Furman acceptance letters. (One of my closest friends actually got in to Yale.) That's strike one pulling me down.

I'm the first in my family to be going to college. My parents or their siblings didn't go to college, nor did my parent's parents, etc. That being said, I cannot turn to them for help, because they seem to be incapable of sympathizing with the stresses of not getting in to my dream school, not knowing the information to fill out the FASFA (Tried asking my mother for the questions I didn't know, she quickly became annoyed), and having crippling fear of immense debt because I don't qualify for any decent scholarships (like I said earlier, shit grades my first two years of highschool). That's strike two, the stress and fear at this point actually hindering my mood, motivation, and ability to think straight.

Third, I don't know what the hell I'm going to major in. Either I major in what I love (Communications. I want to either be a journalist or make documentaries), or I major in something that makes money so I can appease my parents and support myself and my lovely SO in the future. I don't want to end up like my mother, who often threatens suicide because of the stresses of her job, or my dad, who has several certifications in what he loves (Computer Sciences) but doesn't get to use them at his job (manufacturing), but I honestly feel like I'm at a dead end.

I'm so stressed at this point. I was going to therapy, and my therapist let me use her computer and she walked me through the steps I needed to to get this far. (Like applications, essays, etc.) but I can't afford it working part time at waitresses' wage ($5.25 an hour), and my parents' insurance doesn't cover it. It's getting harder to see my educational future, and even harder to see myself in a cap and gown walking across the stage.

I even tried joining clubs but most of them aren't run anymore

Another big trend I notice is EVERY girl has a boyfriend already. Im a single guy and I would like to maybe meet someone as most people (at least as far as I know) meet their SO in college. However every time I meet a new girl or even when I just see them in my class I quickly find out they have a boyfriend.

I've applied to a few schools, the main ones that I want to go to are Berkeley, UCLA, or UCSD. I am in California so I'd be paying in-state tuition and according to Berkeley's website the estimate is around $32,000. I have submitted my FAFSA and have been estimated to receive a boost of around $5,000-$10,000. My father is also going to dump his 401k for me, providing another $10,000. This is only $20,000 though, still clearly not enough. Now my next option is to apply for other loans, for example, the Parent PLUS loan.

Here's the catch. According to the website, due to my parent's slightly recent short sale on a previous house, the mark will not allow them to be eligible to receive a loan. So now I don't have anyone to cosign for me, and my grandparents won't cosign for them either.

I have absolutely no idea what to do. I'm applying for scholarships, but the chances of getting $15,000 from it is slim to none.

I've worked hard throughout my high school education and I've always been encouraged to try the hardest I could so that I could get into these competitive schools. Now that I've done so and am academically capable (at least, within reason of eligibility, I haven't received any official word of acceptance yet) but unable to come up with a solution, I feel crushed. My parents, especially my dad, is literally to the point where he has told me he feels he has failed me because I stuck up to my end of the task (educational goals) whereas he didn't (financially).

My parents have tried thinking of so many other things to try to pay, but the inability to cosign is such a detriment. 

Reddit, help. What's another step I could take to trying to get more aid? Are there student loans or anything at all that I've missed that I might perhaps be eligible for?

I am a decent student who has held my own throughout high school, I have around a 92 GPA and I have never felt school was all that much of a challenge (besides A2T). I am having a really hard time deciding on what degree(s) I want to pursue in college. My original plan was to major in physics/pre-engineering and eventually move on to get a masters in a specific branch like environmental engineering; but the more I think about it, the less appealing it sounds. I know college is no cake-walk when compared to high school, I am aware it is a lot more work. Something about thinking about taking tons of difficult math and physics courses just does not sound appealing. I know it would all be worth it in the end when I had my degree and a high-paying job but I just don't know. I have considered following the whole ""major in something that makes money, minor in something you're passionate about"" philosophy; so, I have considered minors in film, marketing etc. Would minoring in something while being an engineering major be a bad idea?

I honestly don't know how I got in, because this was my reach school. But maybe that's part of the reason why I'm so unhappy here. I'm in second semester of my freshmen year, and I still hate it. The school is really small, so they kept promoting their sense of community and how everyone loves each other, which isn't really true. It's also really cliquey here, and I don't really like it, but it wouldn't be so bad if I actually fit in with a clique. I find myself friends with only about five different people in different groups. Even when I am with them, I feel like they don't really like me. I also always have to make plans with them, so I never really get invited anywhere, which is hard. I've joined about 6 clubs, none of which where I have clicked with anyone. I would join greek life, but there is none on my campus. I have tried really hard to make friends and talk to people but it never goes anywhere. The campus is also in the middle of nowhere so there is never anything to do. The city is an hour and a half away so it's really time consuming to go, which is hard bc I can never just run out to dinner or to do something, I can only go on a friday or saturday. I am really far away from home, and that's making everything so much harder. The classes here are also really rigorous, which I don't mind but it's hard when there are weeks and all I have done is study. There aren't any parties on my campus, and I want to go out and meet people and experience that. I thought I was a social and likable person, but being here makes me feel like a loser or a freak.

The problem is, I definitely can't get into a better school. I am a nursing major, and I am at one of the top nursing schools. It's a really competitive major, so my chances of acceptance somewhere else are pretty slim. The programs at other schools are also surprisingly more rigorous so I am already behind in class requirements. I really wish that I was okay here because transferring is so hard. I am just so disappointed with my college experience and I am so lonely all of the time. I thought it would get better.

TL;DR I go to a top 20 school but I am really unhappy with the lack of a social scene, location and size. It is really affecting me mentally. I am a nursing major and I don't know if I can get into another good school, but I know I don't want to be here.

My first French class was two year ago. I took one semester and got an A. However, this does not reflex my ability to speak clearly or to be able to understand when someone is speaking French (I am talking about basic beginning French), only my good memory, which got me through. When it comes to the actual talking and listening, I am terrible. 

I only took one semester then transferred the next year to another school where a foreign language is required to graduate. I liked French enough to consider taking it again and took my language placement test for it. I was surprised when it put me in French 102. Keep in mind that it was fill in the blanks and listening, no speaking.

Then I had to put school off of an entire year because I had problems with tuition. I decided to bypass French for the first quarter and now I am back at it. That is, again, about two years since my first semester of French.

I have studied a little before classes, but cannot even remember to count to 20. I feel as if I can (or should) study hard and catch up, but I am having such anxiety that this seems daunting. I was lucky enough to have a very close knit French class the first time around in which I was more okay with making an ass of myself when I tried to speak the language.

My math class in 8th grade is a class some people in my grade haven't reached yet. I'm currently a sophomore, but I have a tough choice to make for next year. 

I'm about to start my second semester of my sophomore year, and I'm taking Accelerated Pre-Calculus Honors. I started the year off with a 59 on my first test because I didn't really prepare/pay attention in class. I payed attention the next couple units and got 97+ on each test. I had an 89 for my grade and felt good before the midterm. If I got at least 70% of the questions correct on the section of the midterm on the first unit (the one I got a 59 on), my grade would be replaced by the percentage (up to an 80). So as long as I did well on the midterm, I would easily have an A and be well set up for getting a 4.0 GPA. 

I got a 48 on the midterm.

I didn't really prepare (I played card games instead and tried to impress some girls), and I know that I could have probably gotten a 100 if I had tried. The worst part is, the grade is permanent and my final semester grade went from an 89 about to be an A, to an 81 with barely any hope of rising to an A (I did actually raise the 59 to a 70 though, so a mini-win I guess).

Now I don't know what to do. If I have lazy streaks like this next year in AP Calculus, I will definitely fail. But if I try hard enough, I'm smart enough to have a 95+. 

Should I take AP Calculus and try super hard so that Colleges see what I can do? Or should I take the safer choice and go with on level Calculus and get a 100 without trying? Is it worth it to keep my GPA up? Or should I try and take the challenge? 

Another option would be to leave Calculus for a year and do AP Statistics, which I heard is easy. But then I would be lost again come senior year so I don't think I should.

What should I do? What would be best to help me get into a decent college (like UGA)?

...

Also, I would need a 98 this semester to raise my grade in Pre-Calc to an A overall. Should I try as hard as I can and put my heart and soul into achieving that, or should I not put so much into it for the large chance I get a 97 or lower and still have a B, which has the exact same end result on my GPA?

But since I am a junior and didn't want all the classes I've taken for CS to go to waste, I decided to have a CS minor. I told myself I could push through and finish this one class and two more over the next few semesters. I was proud of myself for not letting all my hard work go to waste.


Unfortunately, that plan didn't work. I began to struggle more than ever to pass the one class I needed to be on my way to a minor in CS. I got a tutor. I got help from a friend of mine who is a professional in the business. I started from the beginning of the notes and tried my best to learn the subject. It just wasn't working. My brain couldn't understand the material and it was destroying me. I was the kid in high school that everyone asked for help. I loved school. But now, I hate it. And yes, I know. College is different. But I didn't know it would be like this. 

So now I'm withdrawing from that class and completely dropping my minor. I feel like a complete and total failure. I don't know how to handle this. I hate myself and I have no motivation. I feel like my friends and family are disappointed in me. In fact, when I told my mom this she said: ""I hate that you're giving up on yourself."" Is that what I'm doing?

How do you use the videos?  Any other resources or recommendations? Has anyone ever hired a private tutor to teach them things like this? How did you find a tutor?

We just had our third test in my intro to chemistry course. I studied harder than for any other, I thought I understood in better than any other, I felt so good coming out of the test . . . and I got a 56%, the worst yet.

Early in the semester a lot of things confused me. I went to my professor's office hours for help and he's a really nice guy who honestly tries very hard to help but it's like he assumes I understand the basics way better than I do. He's trying to build on a foundation that doesn't exist. It's the lowest chemistry course my school offers so I honestly don't know what else I'm supposed to do. The assumption I know things and then the incredulous look he gives me when I say I don't has me so frustrated and ashamed that I actually cried. Now I avoid office hours because I just feel so *stupid* when I'm there; not because he makes me feel that way deliberately but because I'm just so fucking lost over things that everyone else apparently gets just fine.

I went to my school's tutoring center as well, hoping it would be easier. The tutors are nice but they can really only answer basic questions, they can't really *teach*, so it's been fine for getting my homework checked but isn't actually helping me understand things.

The big problem? I'm a nutrition major. Not only do I need this class but I need General Chem II, Organic Chem I &amp; II, and Biochem I &amp; II. I know Organic Chemistry is a nightmare. So how can I possibly pass it when I can't even pass general chemistry?

I've ordered an ACS study book because that exam will be worth the same as three exams; if I do very very well I can pull myself up to a B. But odds are that will be nearly impossible, and even if I *can* manage it there's no way I'd have the foundation to move on at this point.",college,"What to do when you just don't ""get it"" in an intro course and office hours aren't very helpful?",http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2m535h/what_to_do_when_you_just_dont_get_it_in_an_intro/,1415863561.0

761,[deleted],1412727801,/r/college/comments/2im2si/im_miserable_at_my_university/,"I don't want to do a throwaway here, so I'll just say that I go to [pseudo-Ivy League college] in [American city]. 

Here's some quick background: This is my freshman year of college. I applied to several different schools and was accepted to three: State School #1, Trade School, and Pseudo-Ivy League School. Even though I desperately wanted to go to Trade School and become a mortician (it's been one of my biggest dreams), I chose to do nursing at Pseudo-Ivy League school because a) the academics are incredibly hard and b) the opportunities are incredible for graduates. Also, I got a better financial aid package, and I'm not about to take out huge loans for mortuary school, since it won't really pay off in the long run. 

Basically, I hate it here. 

First off, let me tell you what I DON'T hate: The nursing program is fantastic and I'm absolutely loving it so far. I want to continue on doing nursing--kind of. These days, I have been questioning my school choice. I have been waking up every day going ""why didn't I go to mortuary school?"" and ask myself that continuously throughout the day. If I had to leave this school for any reason, however, I doubt I would continue pursuing my secondary dream of nursing. I am also doing fine academically (getting a B average, which is acceptable for both the parents and me at a school this tough). 

However, I just dread getting out of bed and facing the day. I am generally miserable all the time doing anything school-related; I don't hang around in study sessions, I don't form study groups, and I always study alone. I have a few friends, but I generally tend to stay away from people because I have gotten a seriously negative vibe from others here--which was NOT the case at the other schools I was accepted to and visited. I have partied but I don't really enjoy it, so that's off the table. Hell, I have problems leaving my room on weekends--I just want to curl up in bed and not see or deal with anyone. I hate doing clubs (I've tried tons and have found no passion or interest) and, as a result, have picked up two jobs that I actually really enjoy doing just to get away from the school. I really, really try to expand my social circle, but I have been constantly let down and now just feel jaded talking to new people. I want to be alone, but I feel so lonely as a result; I often find myself mulling over this and crying. 

I have no idea what to do at this point. Should I transfer to Trade School and pursue my original dream? What if I flip-flop between that and nursing, though? (Mortuary science is, predictably, not a major at Pseudo-Ivy League School.) Is my problem even my major or is it just social adjustment? I'm so confused and it's just making me even more frustrated. 

TL;DR went to second-choice school because of better financial aid; stuck in a place I absolutely hate and want to leave but can't because I enjoy my major/afraid of losing my awards package and having to pay more.

On one hand, you want to supposedly prove that you're this super amazing person, and on the other hand you also need to show human flaws to show you're well rounded, or good at overcoming failure or w/e.

But there's a few tidbits I'm looking at and wondering whether or not I should fill out the fields or not. One of these is race - and that brings up the question of affirmative action, especially if you're Asian. Will putting it or not putting it shift the scales for admissions, especially if you're applying to a school with a very rigorous admissions process with high competition? Why?

And is it better to include something you attempted that would give a good advantage when applying but failed miserably to show you tried, or leave it out entirely as if it never happened?

**Academics**


When I applied to schools as a HS Senior, I knew my passions, but didn't know what I wanted to do with them. I applied to music schools around Michigan and got accepted to Central Michigan. I studied voice my freshman year, and I did great with a 2.96 GPA. I felt it wasn't right though. Sophomore year I began to look into studying business, and music production. My GPA at the end was 2.4, not great but respectable. My third year I felt music wasn't right, tried art/photography. Besides for my depression which I'll get to, this was the worst I've done. 1.6 GPA. I dropped from school and came back to live with mom and dad to figure out what to do next. 

**Personal**

*This might seem irrelevant, but it's not.*

Going into my Freshman year at CMU I considered myself a crossdresser. I was okay with that then. As the year went on I more or less ignored it, and stuck to the gender stereotype. Doing this began to spin me into a mild depression, but it was something I could handle. My sophomore year, my depression worsened, I came out to my roommate and asked to be more open about it, he said yea. I learned a lot about myself that year, and began to consider myself genderfluid, by the end of the year I started to feel gender dysphoria and with it a higher sense of depression. My third year my depression and dysphoria took me big time, my GPA reflects that. I spun into the worst depression of my life, trying my best to maintain a normal life. I couldn't do it, drank a lot, partied hard. By the end of my 3rd year I started to think I was transgender. Going home, I put myself into therapy. Talking to her and being able to find myself, I saw something I hadn't seen before. My passion for helping people and their gender identity. Because of this, I think I found what I want to study, gender, women, and sexual studies, a psychology degree perhaps?

**Extracurricular**

My freshman year I really didn't do much. It was hard for me to find a club I really fit into, so I tried to sing in as many choirs as I could, tried Barbershop, Jazz, Chamber. My sophomore year I found photoclub, joined that and felt it was a great fit for me. I continued singing in the vocal jazz group. The third year I took on presidency of photoclub and also joined a music recording club as there visual media member. The jazz group disbanded due to lack of interest.  

**Conclusion**

I'm looking at schools in Washington State as it's my dream to live in Seattle on day. *I'm not looking for sympathy or help about my personal life. I'd like help trying to figure how to write an essay merged around those three points.* Because I have such a low gpa, I feel I need to really speak highly of my Photo Club presidency status, and then correlate the transgender issues to the low GPA. I will also talk about what I can bring to the school in terms of LGBTQ issues and starting a photoclub if they do not have one yet.

Thank you for your help.

I moved in Thursday, and it's been...okay, it's been okay. My roommate is okay, not really talkative or a person to hangout with, but seems like he'll be fine to live with. However, my hall in my dorm, no one opens their doors except me and one other person, so I've talked to like two people on my floor. My friends from my high school all seem to have cool roommates and a cool hall in a different dorm than mine in which they've met people, and are meeting people easier than I. I have to text them to hang with people cause I don't know anyone else really. I went to a Fraternity meeting thing last night where all the fraternities are set up and tell you about each one, and I gave my info to like four or five and one member of one asked for my number, so I at least have that going for me for parties and stuff.

But today, like 30 minutes ago, my parents left, and honestly it was a lot harder than I thought. I'm an only child so maybe that has something to do with it, but my mom started crying and I teared up but kept myself from crying. Then I hugged my dad, he said I'm proud of you (which typing and rereading this makes me tear up, meant a lot), and then I said bye once more and walked away. It was honestly super hard, I teared up in the elevator back up to my room, and then had to go stand in the bathroom cause my roommate was there and I didn't want to be seen crying. I went into my bathroom and just let the tears run, no sobbing but man I'm sad. I miss my parents already, I miss my close friends, I miss my cat...I miss a lot of stuff. I miss high school. In my high school, I was one of the most popular kids in the school, not trying to brag, just simply stating. I don't want to be the guy that peaked in high school, I want college to be even better, but sometimes I wonder how or even if it's possible for me to become who I was in high school in college. I mean I'm outgoing and good at making friends and went to all the parties in high school and already have gone to one each night I've been here...

So yeah, if you read all of that, thanks. I just want to know, how long till I get used to this? How long till I get used to being away from my parents, and my best super close friends who I haven't found anyone even close at being able to take their position. Or not being popular and well known like I was in high school, with lots of friends and people to hang with at all times. At the parties...I know like five people out of one hundred...and it sucks. And I feel like lots of the people at the party were like me in high school, so I feel like my popularity in high school meant nothing. I felt like I was just getting a hang of it tomorrow, but we left this party and my friends left except for this new guy I met through them to go home. So me and him tried to find another party, and ended up meeting this other group of a guy and two girls. Well my new friend left to go to his dorm, so I was with them. We went inside, I said I was going to the bathroom real quick, and when I came out...they had ditched me and were no where to be found. Honestly, this cut deep, like real deep. I ended up walking by myself back to my room, looking at the groups of people hanging out. Felt bad.

But yeah...thanks for your time guys, means a lot.",college,How long does it take to not be homesick?,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2eectc/how_long_does_it_take_to_not_be_homesick/,1408850175.0

My department is screwing me over. The problems started in the fall. I had taken all of my prerequisite classes but two, and you needed permission numbers to get in to the classes. I did everything I was supposed to do, and my advisor said ""oh, we'll send you the numbers next week."" But she didn't. Then, the next week, I emailed and she told me I would have to wait for grades to post, and the next week she told me to wait for some processing. Then the school closed for Christmas. When it opened back up, I emailed and emailed and emailed, and then the classes were all full. So I had to spend my time and money taking a chemistry class instead of what I was supposed to be taking. Well, I called to complain, and the advisor had left a few days before. I had no advisor for 2 months. Well, it was all okay, because I could just take the classes that summer. The next problem happened when I was supposed to get my acceptance to nursing school. My school has a policy that qualified students who started out as a freshman have automatic acceptance. I qualified and was guaranteed by my old advisor that I would get in. Then, come April, I didn't. I called my advisor, and she didn't answer. I tried to make an appointment, but she was booked up. I even called the dean of the department, who sent me straight back to my advisor. Finally, I got an email saying that she had a cancellation and she'd meet with me. I actually got my parents to go with me, because they obviously don't listen to me, so I thought they'd listen to someone who paid the tuition. Well, we finally got her to look at it, and surprise! There had been a clerical error and I was supposed to be admitted. Well, I got admitted two days later. Now I had to get the permission numbers for summer. I had to email almost every day for two weeks before she finally let me have them, the day before class starts. Well, my classes started for the summer, and I started struggling with one of them. Now, I'll just say that my grades have never been perfect, but if I'm not doing well, I won't go down without a fight. So I went to her office every week asking for tips, studied for 2 hours every day, went to every class. Then my homeworks and quizzes started disappearing off of Blackboard. Like it never happened. I'd taken them and made good grades, but they were not even showing up. It was ridiculous. I asked her for study tips all the time, talked to my (different) advisor several times, worked really really hard. But I only made it out with a 72. (Nursing classes consider a 74 or lower failing.) Now I'm a semester behind. So I called my advisor, who sent me to my old pre-nursing advisor to get the permission numbers ONCE AGAIN. It's been a week, and I still haven't heard back. 

I know that I'll sound crazy for this, but I think they're trying to get me to drop out. Withholding permission numbers, rejecting me from the school? I think they're trying to weed me out because I only have a 3.0 GPA when most of the other kids have a 4.0. We have one of the highest employment rates (97% of graduates have job offers before they even graduate) in the state. It's like they take the kids who are most likely to fail, and make them fail before they can mess up our statistics. I know that failing the class was on me, but everything else feels so out of my control. I feel like they're just playing me like a marionette! Am I crazy?

I'm taking this class and Physics 2 which my grade in there isn't that great either as the first exam for both classes I put nearly all my effort into preparing for Calculus and did horrendous on both exams. I took my Physics exam the other day, and I was able to prepare and felt I did well. Calculus is another story. Final exams are left for each class now.


I'm a freshman Physics Major- after this summer I'll be a sophomore- and I had to take 4 courses during the summer-5 week intensive courses- to 'catch up' in my major. I had to retake Pre-Calculus- therefore I couldn't take Physics.Which really set things back a bit so instead of only taking Phys 2 and Calc B this summer I had to take Calc A and Phys 1 as well. I did solid in Calc A and Phys 1( B and B+ respectively) first summer session but this session is killing me. I think I'll be able to pass Physics- hoping for a B-/B at best- but Calculus I don't think so. I'm sitting at just a 3.0 right now before these grades for this session go in.


I'm thinking of changing my major because next term Physics majors take Modern Physics and I can't take that class if I fail either of these and since it's only offered in the Fall, I'll still be behind a year. Anyone have any thoughts of what I might switch to? I love Physics, but I'm not going stay in a major that I'm not having progress with. Reason I joined Physics is not only for Physics, but big reason is I want to do Medicine after undergraduate. I know Med School is open to any major. I had a interest in Psychology, I've never actually taken a actual class but we had a seminar style class for incoming freshmen first semester that was focused on identity and had a psychological focus to it that I liked. But a big reason I liked Physics as a major option was for the options available to me if I had a change of heart graduate school wise and research opportunities were there.

I also 100% did not expect to get in, since it was my number one school I was waitlisted on the first go round and got super discouraged and didn't accept my waitlist position, even though rumor has it that almost everyone gets in from the waitlist. 

I left school A last spring fully expecting to go back in the fall. Had a great housing situation with all my friends. 

Early June, got super late unexpected, essentially unthought about acceptance letter and giant scholarship for school B. Told friends from school A about it. They got mad and told me I couldn't leave them and gave me all the reasons not to leave.

The major I'm talking about is computer science. I can follow the lectures for the most part, but when it comes to the labs I'm completely dumbfounded. I've already asked for multiple extensions and I know for a fact I'm not going to be able to do that anymore. I just feel left behind, like I'm the fat kid struggling to catch up to the rest of the class, wheezing and sweating included. 

The lectures include basic framework for what we're going to do in the lab, but the labs themselves are basically far beyond what I was expecting them to be. It's like you're given a hammer and you're asked to build a house with only a tiny bit of knowledge under your belt. I apologize for all the analogies, but they're really the only way I can convey as to how I feel about all of this. This class alone is taking up 70% of my school work and time, and I've still got three other classes to worry about. 

I've thought about taking a semester off to try to catch up, but when I've tried asking my mom about doing so a year ago, she started bawling and begging me to keep going. She kept saying things such as: ""You won't go back!"" or ""You NEED a degree or you're going to be working a job you hate like me!"" It's like she thinks I'll do exactly what she did and end up exactly like her and nothing I do or say will wipe those thoughts from her mind.

-I went to one of the top party schools in the country.  It also attracted a lot of students from blue collar families.

-with that in mind here is my list. 

10. Sex in the quiet study room.  [Hey, it had 4 walls and a lock on the door! The smell was unbearable and there were frequently used condoms lying about, this was eventually closed to students]

9. Pissing in the elevator.  [There were only 2 urinals on our 5th floor bathroom. When we had parties there was always a line.  One day I found that my car trunk key fit the firefighter operation key in the elevator, same day 10 copies were made. We would stop the elevator on our floor during party nights and use it as a urinal, for my entire college experience that elevator smelled like piss]

8. Puke in the shower.   [This actually started the first night of the first semester I was in Oz.  It was at least a weekly occurrence.  The RD had meetings with us about this on a regular basis. Eventually we were all fined 10 dollars a week in damage fee's since no individual would admit doing it. We always blamed the floor below and above us]

7. Sex in the elevator.  [since the quiet study room mentioned in #1 was closed to students after heavy use, the handy elevator key was used to stop the elevator in between floors to have sex in.  Like the quiet study room it smelled like dirty sex and condoms were frequently left there.  One elevator was designated the piss elevator, the other was the sex elevator. The only annoying part about this was, couples would knock on your door at 3-4am looking for the key, after many late night occurrences more copies of the key were made]. 

6. Shitting in lounge chairs in the lounge.  [This was only really done by a few individuals, who probably had mental problems. But nonetheless, a few times people decided to shit in the lounge and use the curtains as toilet paper.  It's hard to get that smell out.]


5. Girl pissing on chairs. [There was a lovable girl down the hall we all called “slut box”.  She didnt mind the name and would introduce herself as such.  Slut box was named so because she was a 6 but after 20 beers looked a 10, and she would literally fuck anyone.  I don't think I had ever seen her turn anyone down, ever.  She was also a raging drunk.  On more than one occasion she would get black out drunk and pull her pants down and piss on a chair, in front of everyone.] 

4. Pissing on car door handles.  [I'm not sure how this game got started but in that part of upstate NY, it is very cold most of the winter.  A “joke” people used to play on each other was pissing on someone's car door handles so that it freezes and makes it so you can't open the car door up.  Then the car owner has to chip away the frozen piss. Eventually this activity waned after several arrests were made for doing this].

3. Shitting in the girls sink.  [A good friend of mine,  who  did a lot of other nasty things, one night decided to walk into an occupied girls bathroom and pull down his pants, sit in the sink and take a shit.  The girls screamed and tried hit him with things.  All the time he thought it was funny and would try to make conversation with them,  usually saying, “oh girls, its just a little poop”.  He would often victimize different floors and different buildings. After a few semesters he got caught and was sent counseling].

2. The cum throwing game.  [This game originally started as retaliation from a previous nights' teabagging incident.  The game consisted of this: you jerk off.  Keep the cum in your hand. Knock on your targets' door.  Throw your cum at him/her. Run.   Unlike snowballs  there is no readily available ammunition to shoot back after you are hit by someones cum.  Often a victim would be seen in the hallway corner cranking it, to produce throwing cum.  As the warfare progressed, assassination attempts were common. This is when you waited until a person sits down or was talking to someone, you come up behind them and wipe cum in their hair or face.   This brutal game lasted over a semester. On some occasions the “slut box” from #6 threw  used tampons or used condoms.   Slut box was attacked a lot because she took it well and frankly we knew she would not file charges against us. Eventually a truce was called, and ended the cum throwing game.

1. Piss filled snapple bottles breaking.   [BK, a kid that lived 5 doors down from me was a full blown alcoholic, meaning he would start drinking when he woke up and drink almost exclusively hard liquor. His beverage of choice was cheap vodka and snapple.  By the time the evening came he was raging drunk.  Often too lazy or too drunk to walk to the bathroom , BK would piss in a snapple bottle and then put the snapple bottle along the wall.  As the semester progressed, his Snapple bottle collection grew.  He was actually very proud of his piss wall collection and would show visitors to the floor. One night, when his collection was as wide as the the length of the room and almost as high as the ceiling, BK accidentally knocks over the piss snapple wall of bottles and they came crashing down and broke.  In a fit of rage he smashed what unbroken ones remained.  Due to the large volume of urine, the floor below got flooded by piss.  Both rooms had to be abandoned for an entire year due to the awful smell.  Our whole floor smelled of piss for quite awhile and his roommates possessions were destroyed including a laptop.  
BK was not well liked on the floor, since he would always drunk argue with you about stupid things, and would steal your alcohol.  Often he would ask people for a little booze while holding a red solo cup.  After  handing him the bottle he would fill the red solo cup to the rim with your liquor and walk back out.  If you protested he would accuse you of being an awful Nazi.  So when BK got kicked out of the school, no one protested. ]

770,[deleted],1389691425,/r/college/comments/1v6iyb/critique_my_essay/,"Okay so thank you guys for reading this essay once again. I'm sure you're getting tired of seeing it and me. I feel pretty good about the beginning but I am worried about the end. Does it sound good? Does the content in this essay make you not like me as a person? If so why? Do I seem over zealous? Do I seem like an asshole? Do I seem to be giving empty flattery? Is there anything I need to expand on? I'm a little worried about the end because I tried to restrain my vocabulary a little bit. Does it make me sound unintelligent?


Many years ago, I met with a _______ adviser at (My college). The meeting that took place that day has haunted me ever since. After sharing my transcript, I was informed that I was a competitive candidate but I was given a warning. I was told I was in danger of accumulating too many credit hours and this could be unattractive and problematic for transfer.


The adviser merely spoke the truth, I do in fact have a massive number of earned hours. At the time of our discussion, I had around sixty hours with still a long way to go. The adviser recommended I apply that day, but I knew in my heart I simply wasn't ready for transfer. I had to build a solid foundation and at that time I wasn't even sure what exactly I wanted to do. I did know however, that I wanted to do more than just attend classes if I got accepted into ___. I wanted to excel, to be involved, and thus I needed more time.


Excelling in academics is a relatively new thing for me as I was diagnosed with two learning disabilities as a teen. This combined with a dysfunctional home environment were catalysts into my choice to give up on education and everything else with it. As a youth, I was shuffled around to three different institutions. Specifically, one of those schools focused on kids that were on bad terms with the public school system. I was on my way to expulsion and went there as a last resort. Many of my classmates had jail time on their record... thankfully I've never had that pleasure. Nevertheless, I was surrounded by trouble makers and I fit right in.


In my second year of college I decided to fix these learning and “attitude” disabilities. I have Dysgraphia, it's similar to dyslexia except it involves the motor functions associated with transcribing words onto paper. In other words, my handwriting was identical to that of a second or third grader. I'd go to a lecture, take notes, and upon my arrival at home I couldn't read what I'd written down. To correct this, I started carrying a Spiderman notebook everywhere I went and I'd write until my hand seized up. I would write pages and pages of notes to my then girlfriend in order to improve my penmanship. I'd write her stories and draw her circles, squares, landscapes you name it. There was this creek by my house and I'd sit there and write about why I was afraid to go home that day. I soon developed a gigantic, painful callous on my middle finger from pencil contact. It's unnoticeable today but it's still there. My new found dexterity even allowed me to pick up the guitar. This was about five years ago and now I must say I prefer cursive. While I wouldn't call it elegant, I'm proud of it.


My family doctor would call my second disability Attention Deficit Disorder. I just like to call it “motivational issues”. This was an easier fix. I began to love school and felt like I could hazard setting some goals for myself. I began receiving external confirmation of my efforts. I was placed on the President's list and have been there for about three years now. I even won an Academic Excellence award in the English category; This was monumental considering my writing disability. In August I obtained my Associates of Science degree Cum-Laude. Eventually in this pilgrimage I stumbled onto my life purpose exactly how one is supposed to… by accident.


My first geology course was mostly there to fill a science credit. We were talking about silicate minerals in lecture when the realization slapped me in the face. I was captivated when I saw how merely two elements, Silicon and Oxygen, can form such a multitude of beautiful minerals simply because of the chemical ratios between them. My whole life made sense in that moment, it made sense why I enjoyed the creeks so much, why as a boyscout I'd habitually wonder off the campsite to explore and in the process become a thorn in the scoutmaster's side.


Geology has taken over my life since then. I'm a member of the Pleasant Oaks Gem and Mineral Society, which is a club for “earth enthusiasts”. This is a blanket term for rock hounders, geology lovers, jewelry makers, fossil hunters, and hikers. I'm also active in a few online geology forums where I converse with professional geologists that I consider friends and role models. Because of these relationships, I'm fully aware of how demanding this degree can be and I know what I'm getting myself into. There will be no surprise when I'm faced with difficult courses such as Petrology, Sed. Strat, and Structural Geology. In fact, these courses sound exciting and I'll often read materials from them. I'm very eager about the lab work as well; I'm anxious to get my hands on some thin sections and get lost in a microscope.


I have three main goals in my life but they don't have concrete order. Number one is eventually becoming a professor. Some of the best relationships I have today are with past professors and in turn, I'd like to be there for every future geology student. To become a professor, I'm planning on obtaining a PhD. I'm not entirely sure at this moment in which specialization because geology is a very broad, interesting field. I look forward to the undergrad research necessary in this pursuit and I'll be able to start sooner rather than later because I've completed so many courses at __. In preparation for the demands of undergrad research at _, I'm going to take on a (science program) project at (my college) next semester in which I will study the local creek systems.


My second goal is working for the USGS. I want to work in either natural disaster prevention or study the changing climate. In West Virginia there are currently 9 counties who lost access to drinking water because of MCHM contamination. They can't even shower in the water or they'll receive chemical burns. I feel like if I were to go into the USGS these are the types of things I could potentially prevent. The USGS is also extremely competitive. A _____ education will help me in achieving this goal because of the top tier geology program. To get hired onto the USGS would be a validation of my hard work, present and future.


As a child, my family would take frequent trips to Argentina where my dad would donate surgical work and we'd visit our close friends who lived there as citizens. My father and I aren't on the best of terms but I'll never forget helping him in those operating rooms and how much he taught me. He didn't teach me how to perform oral surgery but he taught me that public service is meaningful and he unintentionally taught me how fortunate I am to have access to clean water at all times. Imagine having to boil water every single time you wanted to drink or cook something. Turning the sink nozzles and having water come out is something I don't take for granted anymore. I personally believe that clean water sources are going to become much more important in the coming decades, even in the United States.


After earning my Bachelors in Geology, I wish to complete a Masters in Hydro-Geology. Upon becoming a Hydro-Geologist, I can fulfill parts A and B of goal number three. Part A is that I want to work for a public water utility. I want to go to work and provide the people of my city with clean drinking water. I feel that _____ is a great institution to achieve this goal in particular because of the very accomplished faculty, Professor _____ and Professor _____ specifically because of their experience in Hydro-Geology and GIS systems respectively. If the opportunity arises I'd like to do research underneath them.


Part B is that I want to use my skills to aid third world countries like my father has. Water is universal and I know that there's so many people out there who have a daily battle with pathogen infested water. I know that a lot of times these problems are relatively fixable but are often ignored due to corrupt governments. Therefore as a Hydro-Geologist I will be able to donate my skills to these people.


I'm ready to leave this nest and fly. I know what I'm getting into and frankly the thought takes my breath away. I feel incredibly rich to know exactly what I want out of life while I'm relatively young and I'm excited to get moving on it. The past five years have been an experiment in search of life calling and I found it. Getting accepted into ______ is a confirmation of all my work and the first step in becoming the person I want to be. In my life I've been at near rock bottom. I've stood on the edge of the cliff but stepped down and kept going. Coming from where I have I feel like I can accomplish anything and I know I have the right mentality to get there. I look forward to joining ____ and I thank you for giving me the chance.",college,Critique my essay?,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1v6iyb/critique_my_essay/,1389709425.0

I'm still considering this a rough draft so don't be afraid to be harsh if needed but as normal, don't make me feel like dog poop please. Towards the end there's probably another heap of missing commas and grammatical errors because this is the result of another writing grind session. I can find and fix these but if anything jumps out please let me know! Does the last few paragraphs sound natural? In particular when I am talking about the professors at this college. Does it sound over zealous? How's my ending paragraph? I always have trouble ending these damn things and always want to try to cram in an extra sentence in the quest for natural sounding and satisfying ending.


Many years ago, I met with a (school I'm applying to) adviser at (my) College. The meeting that took place that day has haunted me ever since. After sharing my transcript, I was informed that I was a competitive candidate but I was given a warning. I was told that I was in danger of accumulating too many credit hours and this could be unattractive and problematic for transfer.


The adviser merely spoke the truth, I do in fact have a massive number of earned hours. At the time of our discussion, I had around sixty hours with still a long way to go. The adviser recommended I apply that day, but I knew in my heart I simply wasn't ready for transfer. I had to build an education foundation and needed a little bit of maturation so to speak. I wanted to do more than just attend classes if I got accepted into _____.

I was diagnosed with two learning disabilities as a teen. These frustrations combined with a dysfunctional home environment were catalysts in my choice to give up on education and everything else along with it. I never put any effort into classes and I can safely say I only opened a textbook outside of class less than three times. During my time in high school I was shuffled around to three different institutions. One of them was the public senior high while the other two were for children with learning disabilities. Specifically, one of those schools was for learning disabled teens who were on bad terms with the public school system. I was on my way to expulsion and went to this school as a last resort. Many of my classmates had jail time on their record, which thankfully I've never had the pleasure. Nevertheless, I was surrounded by trouble making kids and honestly I fit right in. Because of my own choices, I entered college with zero experience in every subject, even algebra.


After an underwhelming first year in community college, I came to the conclusion that if I wanted to find my life calling, then I needed to get past these learning and “attitude” disabilities. So I fixed them. One of my disabilities is Dysgraphia, in layman's terms it's similar to dyslexia except it involves the motor functions associated with transcribing words onto paper. Basically my handwriting was identical to that of a second or third grader. I'd go to a lecture, take notes and then upon my arrival at home I couldn't read what I'd written down. To correct this, I carried a Spiderman notebook with me everywhere I went and would write until my hand ached. I'd write pages and pages of notes to my girlfriend, now wife, in order to improve my penmanship. I'd write her stories and draw her circles, squares, prisms, rectangles you name it. There was this creek by my house and I'd sit there and write about why I was afraid to go home that day. I soon developed a gigantic, painful callous on my middle finger from pencil contact which is still there today. My new found dexterity even allowed me to pick up the guitar. Cursive writing is now my preference and while I wouldn't call it elegant, I'm proud of it.


Medical professionals would call my second learning disability Attention Deficit Disorder. I just like to call it “A lack of motivation stemming from feelings of no life purpose”. This one was easy to fix. When I started participating in my education, I didn't know exactly what my calling was but I knew education was integral to it. I took so many courses at _____ solely for the pursuit of finding what I enjoyed. School was downright fun at this point and I began receiving external confirmation of my efforts. I was placed on the president's list and have been there for about four years now. I even won an Academic Excellence award in the English category which was monumental considering my writing disability. Eventually in this journey I stumbled onto my life purpose exactly how one is supposed to … by accident.


When I decided to take my first geology course it was because I figured “ Eh, what the heck why not?”. That day in lecture we were talking about silicate minerals when I learned that this was exactly what I was meant to do. I will always remember that sheer captivation when I saw how merely just two elements, Silicon and Oxygen, can form such a multitude of beautiful minerals just because of differing chemical ratios between them. I felt as if I'd discovered an exciting new world and I felt so welcome in it. Geology was my purpose all along and I never knew. I think this is why i felt so at peace when down at the creek looking at shale formations.


Geology has taken over my life since then. I'm a member of the (geology club) and I'm active in online geology forums where I converse with professional geologists that I consider friends and role models. Because of this, I'm fully aware of what I'm in for and I know how demanding this degree can be. I won't be surprised when faced with difficult courses such as mineralogy, sed. strat, and structural geology.


I have three main goals in my life although they don't have a particular order. Number one is I eventually want to become a professor. I want to be there for the next student who unknowingly loves geology and be able to share this wonderful field with them. Some of the best relationships I have today are with past professors and I want to experience the other side for a change. To achieve this dream of becoming a professor I plan to participate in undergrad research. Another benefit of having completed so many courses is that I will be able to jump into undergrad research sooner rather than later while obtaining my Bachelors of Science in Geology.. Next semester with the (science) program at ______ college. I'm going to undertake a research project where I plan to study the local creek systems in my city in preparation for the demands of undergrad research at (college).


My second goal is to work for the USGS because I feel it to be one of the more significant ways I can participate in public service. Working in the USGS gives me the opportunity to help citizens stay safe in their day to day lives. I can work to help prevent natural disaster and I can contribute in the fight against climate change. The USGS is extremely competitive. I feel like a ______ education will help me be competitive in achieving this goal because of the phenomenal geology program. To get accepted into the USGS would be a validation of my hard work, current and future.


My third goal is that I want to work for a city water utility. As a child my family would take frequent trips to Argentina where my dad would donate medical work and we would visit our close friends who lived there. It saddened me deeply to see how many people simply did not have access to clean drinking water and I even suffered the effects from it on one visit. I personally believe that clean water sources are going to become much more important in the coming decades, even in the United States. To work for a public water utility would be yet another way that I can contribute to society and enjoy it. Unclean drinking water is a very scary thing and as a geologist I can do my part to prevent this.


After earning my Geology degree I wish to complete a Masters degree in Hydro-Geology. By obtaining this degree, I can fulfill my aspirations of working in a service orientated field. I feel that ______ is a wonderful institution to achieve this goal in particular because of the very accomplished faculty. I have read some research of Dr. ________ who studied drinking water contaminants in Bangladesh while earning his PhD. I feel that his accomplishments are in tune with my goals. Dr._______ would be a great role model in my pursuit of becoming a Hydro-Geologist and if the opportunity arises I would like to do research underneath him.
I have also looked heavily at Professor _____ who uses ground penetrating radar to study rock glaciers and land slides in Colorado. Learning from him would allow me to prepare for my eventual goal of working in the USGS for natural disaster prevention. Professor______ would also be a great resource for gaining experience in GIS systems which become increasingly important to the modern professional geologist.


I'm ready to leave this nest and fly. I know what I'm getting into and frankly the thought takes my breath away. I feel incredibly rich to know exactly what I want out of life and I'm excited to get moving on it. I've experimented with several courses in search of life calling and I found it.

I've stood on the edge of the cliff but stepped down and kept going and coming from where I have I feel like I can accomplish anything.

772,sammywhammy52,1354590801,/r/college/comments/148omw/dorming_is_officially_ruined_for_me/,"I apologize in advance for the ranting...

So let me start with the background of the situation. I am a sophomore but this is my first semester at my new school because I transferred after last year. I know that a small percentage of people like their first year roommates, but you have to believe me when I say that I was living with the two most awful, unreasonable, and overall nasty people you can think of. I was argued with, yelled at, and even threatened all because I wanted to be able to get enough sleep. I got my RA involved countless numbers of times, but all she would say was to ""respect each other"" and figure it out. I'm a level-headed and reasonable person, but telling that to someone with no morals obviously doesn't do anything to help. I would be woken up at 2 a.m. by our room lights getting turned on, once when I had a 7:30 a.m. final that morning, and my roommate would blast her music as loud as possible to the point where it could be heard clearly all the way down the hallway. Still, nothing was done for months. Finally I was offered a different room, but this was only 5 weeks before the end of the spring semester. By this time I had already submitted applications to new schools. A lot of my decision to transfer stemmed from my awful dorm experience, and to this day it still frustrates me the way it was handled by the school. My second room had great people and made the rest of my time there tolerable, but I still wanted to get out of there as fast as I could. 

Fast forward to this year. At first I didn't even want to live in a dorm anymore. I'm a very independent person and I wasn't feeling too good about being put back into a random pool of potential roommates given the situation I was in last year. However, I met some other transfers at spring orientation and I was really excited that one of them would be my roommate. Orientation was a little over 24 hours, and my orientation group, all transfers, got really close quickly. Everyone was really friendly, which is something my school is known for. However, there was one girl in the group who, although she was very nice, was already getting on my nerves by the time we left. She spent most of the orientation talking about herself, and she had an opinion about EVERYTHING. I decided that it was probably just a one time thing and didn't think too much about it afterwards. During orientation we all agreed to be randomly placed as roommates, but that we would all request to be housed with other transfers so we could all be together. There was an immediate bond between us because of our similar situations. A few weeks later we got our rooming assignments. I was placed with the girl who had gotten on my nerves within 24 hours of knowing her. I'll call her C.

At first I went into the situation with a very positive feeling. We were able to meet up over the summer, which was really pleasant. We also found out that our friends from orientation were going to be living a room over from us. I was so excited to finally have a good roommate and know people on my floor and have the college experience that I see other people having. 

Looking back, our situation didn't start off as good as I thought it was. C moved in the day before me, and had already claimed the bigger closet and the dresser that wasn't hard to get to. She had already spread her stuff out all over the room, including the spots that were supposed to be mine. Her bottled waters, for example, were on my dresser. At this point we were still friends and I didn't care enough to ask her to move them. For the first few weeks things were generally fine in our room. Trying to be friendly and non-confrontational, I let a lot of things go that, looking back, I should have addressed right away. She wouldn't use headphones. Ever. Even if I was sleeping. Her boyfriend, who lives only minutes from us, would be over all hours of the night. She also made a lot of rude comments without thinking about them, like once when my boyfriend told me I was smart and she yelled ""No, you're so dumb, kill yourself."" When I later confronted her about this comment, she said that she didn't even remember saying it, but it stuck with me to this day. Another problem she had was leaving our door open when she wasn't in the room and I was gone. Our door can be unlocked so that you can walk back in without needing a key, which is really helpful for things like using the bathroom or taking a shower when you have to leave but its inconvenient to bring keys. C, however, would instead leave our door wide open and leave for extended periods of time. Personally I don't care if she wants to leave her stuff vulnerable, but when my laptop and DSLR camera are sitting feet from our open door, I have a problem. Our school is pretty lenient with the guest policy, so strangers are able to wander the building and aren't questioned, and there have also been thefts by students. I don't think it is unreasonable to ask that if she was leaving the room for any amount of time that the door at least be closed, not even locked. At one point she even left our door wide open and left the building for hours. Anyone could have walked it and taken whatever they wanted, and since my stuff is closer to the door it probably would have been mine. The most obvious problem, however, has been her having alcohol and drugs in our room. Neither of us is 21, so obviously I don't want to be blamed should someone find those things in our room. When I brought this up with my RA I was first told that nothing could be done because she had no solid evidence other than me telling her that it was there. At one point C told me directly that she had pot on her, but my RA was still unable to do anything because she ""hadn't seen or smelt it"" herself. Frustrating to say the least.

To be honest, I didn't want to say anything to her at first because I didn't want to look like a nagging bitch of a roommate. I don't like to confront people, and I didn't want to start issues with her and make her feel like I was nitpicking her every move. But there was a lot of stuff she did that either got on my nerves or was just disrespectful to me and my space.  I finally got the courage to talk to her about a few issues I was having, but I would ask her to do or not do something and she would be doing or not doing that same thing again the next day. I literally asked her 4 different times to wear headphones while I was clearly sleeping. I decided that I needed to do something, so I went to my RA. Considering that my RA last year was a joke, I was so happily surprised to find that my new one was incredibly understanding and genuinely wanted to help me. After telling her my story she even said that although as an RA she wasn't supposed to pick sides, she definitely had my back. She encouraged me to have another conversation with her about what was bothering me, and eventually we met together with her. It was decided that we needed to rewrite our room contract, because the first time we did it I was the one writing everything down while she didn't show much interest at all. Our first contract was also very vague because at the time it was written I figured that whatever problems we had we could handle them on our own. Obviously not the case. Anyway, we talked prior to redoing our contract and decided that we would each take some time to think about what we wanted to be included so that neither of us would feel pressured into something we didn't want and we wouldn't forget anything. I took this new contract very seriously, seeing it as a fresh start for our room and by this time needing some serious changes in the way things were going. I went over every question and wrote out what I would want to see, expecting some compromise when we actually talked about it. When we got to the meeting, C hadn't prepared anything and just sat there while I read off my list. My RA kept encouraging her to voice her opinions but she just sat there saying ""I'm just here to do what sammywhammy52 wants."" Eventually I just stopped talking because I was so uncomfortable. I didn't feel that anything I was asking for was unreasonable (use your headphones when I'm sleeping, let me get enough sleep, send your boyfriend home at a reasonable hour on school nights, give me a heads up before you sexile me so I don't get locked out without my books) but I left feeling like I had asked her to be my personal slave. Apparently she didn't feel too great about it either because although she was given every opportunity and even encouraged to disagree with me and instead she just sat there and said she was fine with it, she told some friends of mine later that night that she was not fine with most of the things I had suggested. I felt like I had spent all that time and effort for nothing. The next step was to meet with our RA and now our RD, who was now fully aware of the situation. We made our contract again, this time with both of us contributing and compromising. We both got some of what we wanted, and both walked away relatively happy. I was feeling better thinking that finally my stuff wasn't going to get stolen and that she wouldn't be touching my things without asking.

Turns out I was wrong, and since then my frustrations have continued but for the most part I have tried to be civil and just deal with it. My sleep hasn't been getting interrupted anymore, but new issues have come up. For example, I keep a pitcher of water in the fridge that we rented together. C has her own pitcher that sits on her desk collecting dust. Until a few weeks ago, I wasn't aware that she had been using my pitcher without asking. It sounds stupid that it annoys me, but it's mostly the fact that I made it clear that I wanted to be asked first before she used my stuff and she was doing the opposite right in front of my face. It made me wonder what other things of mine she was using when I wasn't around. This didn't become a huge issue though until she drank from the pitcher, without using a cup, right in front of my face. I should have said something, but at the time I was so shocked that I didn't even know what to say. I later asked her to wash the pitcher and refill it, but I don't believe she ever did. That crossed the line for me from things that are annoying to things that are unsanitary and just not ok. Still, I let it go because I didn't want to restart drama and tension in the room.

Throughout all of this, I have maintained a twitter account which I post to multiple times a day. Last year neither of my roommates had a twitter account and didn't give a shit enough about me to see if I did, but if they had they would have found a ton of posts dedicated to venting my frustrations about them. At the beginning of the semester C created a twitter account, but deleted it a few weeks later. Once things became really frustrating with her, I slowly fell back into the habit of tweeting about her, thinking that since she had deleted her account that she wouldn't see them. And in a weird way, I almost wanted her to see them. Obviously this seems really stupid to me now, but I thought that maybe if she saw my tweets about how annoying she was that she would finally understand and I wouldn't have to keep asking her everything multiple times. Anyway, she reactivated her account a few days ago, and since my tweets were public at the time, she saw everything. Honestly, I don't feel like anything I said about her was that terrible, but I understand that in today's world something that wouldn't be given more than a talking to about if said in person is considering cyber-bullying and harassment if it is posted online. I was called to meet with my RD immediately, asked to spend the weekend off campus (even though I've been very sick this entire time and it has put a damper on my ability to get homework done), and today was moved to a completely different room on campus. I have told everyone involved that I am more than willing to continue living with her in our room since it is inconvenient for either of us to be changing rooms right now with finals coming up only a week from now. However, I have been told that C is not fine with this, and so here I am, typing this post from the commuter room that is usually saved for students who need to stay overnight on campus for some reason. 

This is the beginning of my frustration. I am trying to be civil, although it is definitely awkward and tense in our room. She isn't, but yet I am the one who is getting moved. I understand that I am the one who created the posts, but if she is the one who is so angry and thinks she might try to fight me then why shouldn't she leave? The other problem I've been dealing with is that this girl is at least as guilty as I am, if not more. I overheard a conversation she had today on the phone with someone (because she didn't think enough to even leave our floor) where she talked all kinds of shit about me and said things even worse than what I tweeted about her. Also, I opened our fridge and there is an empty bottle of wine laying in the bottom. Of course I texted my RA what's been going on in my absence, and her reply was that because the bottle is empty that there's nothing she can do. I'm not saying that any of that excuses what I did, but I feel like it's pretty unfair that I'm being treated like a criminal for making fun of her but she's literally doing things that are against the law and nothing is happening to her. At this point we are supposed to go before a conduct board of our peers on Thursday, at which point they will decide what sanction I will receive. From what I've been told it won't be anything extreme, most likely some sort of apology note or some work with an RA. Mostly it just bothers me because other than the tweets, I am the victim in this situation but it is being treated like the other way around. I am a good student, I was nominated for the same conduct board that will be seeing our case, and this type of thing is not typical for me at all. I'm feeling so many things at the same time, and I don't really know what do to or feel or say. I guess I'm just looking for some advice or some encouragement from anyone who has experienced something like this. Again, sorry for the rant. I just have a lot of feelings.",college,Dorming is officially ruined for me.,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/148omw/dorming_is_officially_ruined_for_me/,1354608801.0
773,[deleted],1353624609,/r/college/comments/13n2e1/the_college_bubble_the_combination_of_economic/,"Since we were young, we've been told that with hard work and determination in high school we would one day make it to college. Once there, if we succeeded with graduating, we'd get a degree which would lead to a well-paying career that would allow us to invest in our future.  With college tuition now leading in the nation's debt with the growing amount of 830 million dollars, we are stuck asking: Why is the college-loan system failing? The College Bubble was a term used to explain the effect of the nation's current financial crisis and college tuition constantly on the rise. That is creating the bubble of debt that will eventually burst. College tuition rates have skyrocketed up 29% in the last five years. The average school year for a standard four year, for-profit college now costs $27,293 and on average only two out of three students are graduating due to not being able to afford their college education. With the economy in a recession and losing over 8 million jobs between the years of 07-09, graduates are struggling in the job market, as well as paying off their student loans (Parker). During the beginning of the recession, many industries felt the collapsing of the economy, industries like that of the stock market, real estate and even oil! All industries but two: healthcare and colleges. During this difficult time, colleges are prospering at student's expense and graduates are not seeing the benefit. This makes the expenditure of college and the hard work of graduates, a poor investment. The government has tried to help students with government aid and programs for low-income graduates, but has failed to fix the problem. Colleges are charging too much for an education that even with government aid and loans cannot be affordable or paid off by a graduate in this struggling economy. The college loan system is failing students due to an endeavoring economy, over college spending causing higher tuition rates, depleting wages and declining job market. College tuition and the loan system that is in place to fund it must be modified to compensate in order to lower student debt. 
	College tuition has obviously risen to unmanageable amounts for college students, but why? It is due to the college arms race. Colleges are currently spending huge amounts of money on their campuses and recreational activities in order to encourage more students, which also means more money. Ohio University economics professor Richard Vedder was quoted saying, ""Every campus has [to have] it’s climbing wall, you cannot have a campus without a climbing wall""(McArdle). In 2009 alone, colleges spent a total of 10.7 billion dollars on construction of new facilities like gyms and nicer dorms in an afford to recruit more students. (Parker). Students will pay more money to attend a college that has a favorite college sports teams. When it comes to NCAA coaches, Brady states statistically that the average salary for a NCAA football coach was is $1.47 million in 2011, which in the last six seasons has climbed up nearly 55% (Brady). If teams meet performance goals, coaches will, in addition, receive bonuses. Such expenses made by colleges for sport teams, may be leisure for a student but how does this help them with a better quality education or with their crippling debt? Students are paying for something that in no way betters their education, just the notoriety of the college. Colleges have found many ways to capitalize off of their students in order to afford such expenditures. Some 4 year colleges require that you must be on campus for your first two years of attending with them. Room and board cost an average of $8,887 in the school year of 2011-12, that is up 4% since last year (College Board). It would make sense why they would require that you stay on campus, if it only put more money into their pockets. College books are another expense of students which colleges are benefitting from. Books are also required by colleges in order to attend classes and are not included in tuition. The cost of college books has tripled in the last 10 years, costing an average of $200 dollars (Parker). Colleges will publish their own books, require students to buy them, then update or revise them every year to make the book obsolete causing students to have to by new ones every year and making the resale of them, nonexistent! Colleges will work with publishers and receive kickbacks for using books they publish. Administration for college also feels the advantage of higher tuition rates. The president of Yale receives salary that has tripled from $591,709 in 2000, to $1.63 million in 2009 (McArdle). 
	Some experts argue that the rising cost of college tuition is due to federal aid programs. David Schnittger, aide to Education and Workforce Committee, argues that, ""The federal government should not have to automatically subsidize hyperinflation,” that ""there is no pressure on [colleges] to keep their rates down [due to government student tuition assistance programs]"" (Colin). What they don't take into consideration is that government aid is normally only given to low-income students. Middle and upper class students don't receive such aid. So how is it that government funded aid programs are to blame for the rising tuition costs? Now with the average cost of graduating at a 4 year college at $27,293 a year (Parker), it is easy to see who is truly profiting from an attending and/or graduated student. Colleges are capitalizing off students in a poor economy, and once out of college there is no guarantee employment will be waiting. 
	In 2008, Americans lost over 10.4 trillion dollars in the financial crisis. Between 2008-2010 over 8.3 millions of jobs were lost. The government tried bailing out the country with  4.6 trillion dollars and was only able to recover 1.1 million jobs, .9% percent of jobs. That is 4 million dollars in cost for each job recovered (Parker). Boyce Watkins, a finance professor at Syracuse University is quoted saying, ""[College] is certainly an investment. The question is whether or not you get your return on that investment in actual financial capital... [and] this blanket notion that going to college will guarantee you a better economic future is not always true""(Billitteri). In 2009, the numbers were at 12.5 million unemployed, which is 8.1 percent of the American population. The numbers have continuing to rise leaving the total count of unemployed at 17.5 million. With unemployment at the highest it’s ever been in the last 25 years (Katel), it's easy to see that even with the investment of college education, the job market is not in a state of stability leaving the college graduate to take minimal paying jobs, move trades, or move altogether to an area which is hiring. All of which is at a cost to them. 
Many people can't afford to move, so they need jobs to come to them. This is one of the least discussed, most challenging problems in the labor market right now...This is the largest annual jump in the number of unemployed since the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics began tabulating this data just after World War II. Most of the unemployed—62.3 percent—are out of work because they lost their job, higher than any point since 1982. (Boushey)
Some argue that college degrees do increase the likelihood of getting employment. The fields of healthcare, engineering and computer science have seen a sharp increase of employment within the last five years (Billitteri). However, are all students obligated to study in fields that are hiring so that they may make a high enough income to pay back student loans? If so, where will our educational teachers, earth science specialists and art specialists come from? Chances are these programs will lose funding. All these degree areas are feeling the economic downturn, does that mean that all students should have to pursue a degree that they don't wish to pursue, in order to guarantee enough income to pay back their student loans? Part of the American dream is to pursue what your passionate about, not to conform to the demands of society. Though some argue it is because of the student's degree choice, if all students were to graduate in a degree that was hiring, wouldn't that cause an abundancy of applicants? Making the job market for those jobs hiring like the rest, not hiring? College graduates not only face the outrageous cost of tuition but once finishing their degree they are stuck in a dead end job market which they cannot avoid. 
	With both college tuition and unemployment at record highs, it is not hard to see why the college loan system is failing. What once was the American dream has now turned into the national debt. With colleges spending too much on non-educational expenses and leaving their students to flip the bill in this economic downfall, it’s no wonder the college loan system is not helping the college graduate. The college loan system has to not only take into consideration the economy's state but the college's spending. While the nation is trying to recover and grow from the current recession it is important to recognize that student borrowing is working against our economic interests and the source of why that is happening. In order for the college graduate to pay off their debt, there must be employment after college and if that is not a guarantee, colleges must reevaluate their expenditures. Until the economy recovers from its current crisis, student debt will only worsen and end up not only costing the American graduate, but the nation as a whole.

774,ninjoshy,1353618591,/r/college/comments/13mxfd/problem/,"So I enrolled for Computer Science Transfer Program in my local community college. I got a grant to cover most of my tuition and small federal loan to cover the rest. I had previously taken all of the computer related courses at my high school, so I'd figured this is what I wanted, but I ended up hating programing. Not to mention all of the upcoming math classes. So I'm failing my programming class (and math) and considering switching my degree. (If I tried very hard, I could end up passing programming.) I've always liked learning foreign languages - even going as far to teach myself enough Japanese to converse and I want to go become a flight attendent after i get my degree - so I kinda want to switch my degree from computer science to japanese. Do you think I should?

I could change it to just a Computer Information degree instead.

In order to do this, I would have to change my degree to a General Studies Transfer because my community college dosen't offer any classes like that. The best thing about that transfer program is that i get guarenteed acceptence into specific colleges and if i get at least a 3.0 gpa my tuition will be completely covered.",college,Problem?,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/13mxfd/problem/,1353636591.0

I'm a twenty-one year old, living at home with a low paying job at a department store. I've got two full semesters at my local community college (~29 credit hours) done, but I've reached a standstill.

I started off badly by being a jackass my senior year of high school and doing almost no work, so that screwed me a bit. Scored a 32 composite on the ACT, 1390 SAT, and perfect scores on all of my statewide comprehensives, save math. Test scores were never an issue for me, nor was the material; I was just a lazy prick. Hindsight is 20/20, blah blah.

Regardless of the shit-stained final quarter of my high school career,  went to community college. Not in any of my classes did I receive anything lower than A's, until I began to follow the same lazy, apathetic tendencies that plagued my senior-year-self. I failed three classes due to attendance, and just stopped going.

Keep in mind, this tuition came out of my own pocket, with help from my dad. I received no financial aid due to my awful transcripts.

Wasted money doing that, and blew the rest of my meager salary on pot and comic books. Now I'm stuck with even worse hours (dropped to MAYBE 20 a week), with my car insurance constantly looming and an unpaid traffic ticket haunting my every financial decision. My family has thus far move away, and I'm stuck in my home town living with friends until I can save enough money to somehow return to college, at least first to community and hopefully move in to a university soon after.

The problem here is, there are no jobs anywhere near where I live, and my student loans require a co-signer due to my lack of credit, which my parents refuse to sign (though I can't blame them, times are tough). 

I really do feel strongly motivated to better myself and return to school, and it's really aching to have a lack of any sort of studying or schoolwork in my life. I've grown up a bit too late, and now I have no idea where to go from here.

What should I do, reddit? Any advice from people who are/were in a similar situation? I'm at wits' end here, and getting pretty desperate - not because my quality of life is in danger of deteriorating any further, but because I truly want to go out and at least try to do something better with my life. I'm well aware that a degree isn't going to secure employment at a decently paying career, but I need to at least be able to say that I tried.

776,[deleted],1333665276,/r/college/comments/rvcs1/western_washington_university_of_university_of/,"Howdy all. As the title suggests, I'm deciding between the two universities.

I've visited both on both official tours and recently a self led walk-around were I could go almost anywhere I pleased without someone yammering statistics and planned dialogues in my ear. UW will cost a few thousand more per year compared to WWU. UW also has upwards of 60,000 students while WWU is closer to 20,000 students.

Both schools offer different aspects of college life. UW offering that big school, almost ""Stereotypical"" college experience with a massive student body, grand old buildings, 150 years of history. WWU is a bit more isolated, okay, a lot more, smaller community with a friendly atmosphere and plenty of opportunity.

Thing is, over the summer I visited both universities and fell in love with Western initially. Whenever I imagined myself at college, the setting was at WWU. However, when acceptance letters came around, that realization that I could go to a ""Big School"" suddenly became very appealing. The name and recognition of UW, petty as it might sound to some, is something I want, to show that I am a hard worker and aim high in my aspirations.

As it stands, I'm looking into studying anything form communications, business or marketing to biology and engineering. At UW however, the engineering program is very selective, and I know of some people who didn't get in and were forced to switch majors and attend another year or two to graduate. Which is another thing, many UW grads take 5 to 6 years to graduate.

Both schools offer great programs in the fields, however I feel that if I go to WWU, I'll be low balling myself, or in other words chickening out from what could be a challenging and enlightening time at UW. This isn't fair to WWU in the end though, to say such things without actually having tried.

I know that in the end I can't be wrong, but I'm just curious about what some other opinions might be. General concensus from those around me say that Western would be a better fit however UW is usually hovering around my mind as well.

Some background: I'm an outgoing person that wants to experience life for what it is. President of National Honors Society at my school as well as an Executive in my leadership class. Currently have a 4.0. Scored an 1810 on SATs, 29 on ACTs (little practice for both, only took each test once). Really enjoyed my AP biology, US history and micro/macro economics class.


**TL;DR** - Deciding to between Western Washington University, smaller school with a great community and University of Washington, ""Big School"" with much perceived opportunity.


Any and all input will be much appreciated, so long as it is concerning the schools or academics in general :)

Hope you all have a stellar day!

777,[deleted],1332508774,/r/college/comments/r9wza/college_dropout_life_edge/,"I quit college. i play poker professionally (cash 2.5). I'm 19. I have only made 12k and all in 1 month and my friend who is a very successful player convinced me to dropout for just one semester to aim for 20k goal. grown tremendously as a person. 

Here’s a thought:

is college an actual necessity to be successful these days or just the spirit of our time?

Radical..I know, but think about it. Our whole youth, grade 1 to 12, 7 hours a day, 5 days a week, we’ve been preached, sermonized and prepared for the wondrous world of a “higher learning” (AKA college) and the paramount betterment it will have on our lives. To persuade us we’re told that our salaries will be higher (i.e. stupid poster: http://www.flickr.com/photos/posamentier/5036649181/) and that there are certain things you will learn in this environment about yourself that you simply cannot without the experience.

These salaries are based on awfully skewed statistics. Honestly, how often will a landscaper or entrepreneur accurately report to the government how many lawns they’ve mowed this year or how many products they have bought and sold without a proper papertrail? Most of these people will report as little as possible to pay as little taxes as possible. Rightfully so (yeaaahh stick it to the man)! 
Why don’t we ever hear about the negatives about college? Suree, we hear about the thousands of dollars in debt you are destined to owe. But there is no way we can fathom how much money that truly is because none of us have ever made that much just to lose it. Why don’t we hear about the guy who graduated from uf with an economics degree, owes 30k to Uncle Sam, but can’t land a job to pay this off? So, maybe by trying to run your own life and be independent, you are actually doing the opposite by creating debt and basically enslaving yourself to the government o.O

you may have a euphoria of self entitlement and satisfaction after working hard to receive an A in a class, but trust me when I say there is no better feeling than working hard and living off what you make. For the first time in my life, I have absolute control over my life. I can be a lazy fack one day, and very productive the next; but without balance, I wouldn’t find success. This is something I had to perfect..not to get good grades..not to make time to party on Saturday night with financial aid $..but to survive nigga! When it becomes a necessity it becomes a lifestyle. I strive to perfect this balanced lifestyle and everyday focus on my mistakes so I can never repeat them. I make my own schedule, I choose to get up in the morning and I choose to be successful. I live in true ineffable freedom. 

I’ve only been out of school for a couple of months now and already so many aspects of my life have improved. I lead a much more fulfilling life, and with a fulfilling life comes raised self-esteem, awareness and ultimate growth. During college id consider myself more of a timid follower who was overly concerned about what others thought of me. I tried very hard to fit in. NO I wasn’t in a frat and will never believe in paying for friends and girls only like you because you can afford to pay for that sh*t you ugly pretentious douche. Anyways, I no longer cared about what others thought about me soon after being on my own, and believe it or not its what has made me a much more likeable guy. I started caring about how I felt about myself. I like to feel good, so now I ironically dress nicer, am friendlier, and most importantly, ‘don’t take no shit from no one’! The first couple weeks I was very far out of my comfort zone and my career suffered tremendously. It took a lot of work, I went through many peaks and valleys (mostly valleys LOL) and I know I am just beginning, but I now have a solid schedule, workout more frequently, and for the first time in my life actually enjoy reading and expanding my mind without the aid of psychedelic drugs (still enjoy those). Basically I am a lot healthier and a lot more stable in almost ever aspect of my life and although there are very little people in my life right now, I feel like I lead a real one.",college,College Dropout: Life Edge?,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/r9wza/college_dropout_life_edge/,1332526774.0

Anyway, I go to college in Olympia, WA which is a very VERY liberal city. I come from a liberal family on the east coast and my college was advertised as being home to a very open minded, mature, and experimental breed of students. No frats, no bullshit, just open minded hippy dippy free love vibes. Well, needless to say it's exactly the opposite here. It's just typical college kids you'd find at any other US college for the most part. There are still frat guys and sorority girls here or at least tons of people with the exact same mentality, there just aren't any frats or sororities. Anyway, I've been looking for some attention from the ladies, I'm not gonna lie, and it always just kills me when I see the kinds of guys that 90% or so of college girls seem to go for now a days. Nasty, dirty, longboard riding, white boy hipster bums who sleep on the floor at night surrounded by PBR cans. No joke. Needless to say I'm not one of those guys. I'm a very friendly, upbeat, pretty good looking, sometimes softspoken and yes occasionally socially awkward African American twenty-something who's into indie music, art, literature, foreign cultures, astronomy and stuff like that. I'm a pretty good student and an experienced musician, well kept, and very physically fit. I'm about 5'11"", 150 lbs and I dress pretty cool and with the times :p. I'm very surprised that I have such terrible luck with girls. I like to have fun too, I go dancing quite often and I actually just threw a pretty cool college party last night. I'm really surprised that after 3 years at this school, I have found NO one and I don't know what I am doing wrong. I have tried EVERYTHING, had many ""near hookups"" that ended in bad luck, tried very hard to get out of my ""nice guy"" bubble and be confident and playful. It's much easier said than done when you're a really naturally polite guy. I'm also into typical nerdy guy stuff like comics, video games, sci-fi/fantasy books etc. Alot of my friends suggest I should join clubs and meet girls who are into that sort of thing but they are NEVER my type. NEVER. (I'm sure you know what I'm talking about) The only thing I can really bond with girls about is music. So here's my observation:

Girls these days see college as a place to be adventurous when it comes to guys. They aren't looking for articulate, mature gentleman who are going to pamper them and treat them like princesses. They want typical college boys who don't give a fuck. They aren't concerned if the guy is going to treat them good or bad, they just want someone they can mess around with for awhile with no strings, and they aren't really interested in hooking up with ""nice guys"" because they think we are going to want something more and we won't be satisfied with just a hook up. Is this a fair assumption? I mean, I know there are girls in college who really like nice guys but usually they are the opposite of my type (I don't have high standards) or they are looking for a nice guy AFTER they finish college. (I also think alot of these girls are going to be in for a shock after they leave college and discover after years of being with shitty guys, that's what they are going to be attracted to for many years after college)

Another thing that I've always wondered is if it has anything at all to do with my skin color. I'm black and my school is about 99.99999% white. It's a fact. I've even had one or two white girls admit to me they aren't really attracted or interested in black guys or anyone who isn't white. Do you think this could be part of the problem? Lol, I doubt I'll get any honest answers to this one, you can pm me about it if you want, I won't judge or flame you :p

Anyway, I know confidence is my key, but with the motherload of bad luck I've had with girls, it's really easier said than done. What do you think girls? Am I doomed being a ""nice guy""?

779,Ridyi,1311627494,/r/college/comments/izivc/so_i_have_to_sign_up_for_my_last_class_for_my/,"So far I'll be taking a PolySci major prereq (4 units; Intro to International Relations), a Linguistics major prereq (4 units; Intro to Linguistics; I plan on double-majoring), and a Linguistic freshman seminar (1 unit).

I need thirteen to be full-time.

I'm wavering between Western Civ (5 units), intermediate Japanese (also 5 units), and elementary Latin (Again, 5). I would take Japanese, but problem is, I haven't taken Japanese in a year and a half and I would need to take a harder class (I can't bring myself to spend money ""learning"" how to write in Japanese. Again.)

So, Reddit, would you recommend? I don't want to struggle through Japanese and my main problem is Kanji. How hard would it be to pick it back up after 3 years of high school classes and a second level community college course?

Also, is Latin hard? I'm pretty good with language (hence the Japanese and linguistics) and I've taken basic French and Spanish courses (though I took to Japanese much, much better). 

**UPDATE: Everyone, thank you so so so much for the amazing advice. I looked for a more fun class and found nothing so decided I could at least take the Japanese placement test. Until I knew for sure, I tried to sign up for Western Civ, but it was conflicting with another class. So until I know whether or not I'll take Japanese, I'm in elementary Latin. Next semester I'll definitely find something fun (and I won't get last pick as a first semester freshman =P). Finally, Western Civ completes more gen. ed. requirements (eg. Reading and Comp). I could always take it later, but I don't know. Is it more worth it to get out of the way, or actually not abhor your first semester?**",college,So I have to sign up for my last class for my first semester and I have no clue what to fill it with...,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/izivc/so_i_have_to_sign_up_for_my_last_class_for_my/,1311645494.0
