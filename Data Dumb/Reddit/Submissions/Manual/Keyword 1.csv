For personal reference, I spend around 200 dollars a month on food, 375 on rent, 60 on gas, 150 on utilities, and 100 on miscellaneous stuff. I make around 900 at my job, and an addition 100-200 through doordash/instacart. I live in an apartment off campus, have a 500 dollars a semester meal plan which covers some lunches for long days on campus

*Coupon, Clearance, and More*

I hate this tip because it makes me look insane to my friends but I save money so I don't care. Walmart is the exception but most grocery stores have an app or printout with coupons and sales. Study and clip the ones you buy for yourself. Don't buy something because it has a coupon, only clip ones for stuff you already buy. Most stores have a clearance section, try to find the meat section and buy and freeze that meat, meat is the biggest expense I have on groceries so finding this out saves me 20-30 bucks on meat alone. Without coupons, clearance, and all that, my grocery bill would probably be almost double than it currently is.

*Plan your Spending*

I never raw dog my spending, I always have it planned out. For me I have in my calendar app my errands and how much I need to spend. For example, I go grocery shopping for 20 days out so on October 20th, I can spend 110 on groceries. I also plan some fun things like maybe 20 dollars for bath things, or 10 dollars at a fast food place. This just makes it a lot easier to budget and you get better as you learn your habits and needs. I don't put my entire budget on it because I like their to be some wiggle room to go on a spontaneous cookout run or something and you never know what's going to happen.

*Check your accounts everyday*

This won't save you any money but it does allow you to pace yourself and your spending. When I wake up, I make sure to check my bank account, credit cards, and Venmo (and school grades but that's not financial, just a good habit.). This just shows me how much I have, how much I am spending, and how much I can continue to spend. It also just makes sure there's no fraud, surprise purchases, or subscriptions. I also had financial anxiety my first couple semesters where I would be too scared to check balances and therefore would spend terribly. So getting in the habit and getting comfortable with viewing your balances is key to having everything in order. 

*Please don't get into addictive habits*

This is a more honest mistake I made, I got into vaping my senior year of high school in the pandemic and still struggle with it, honestly I don't do it often, just in the morning and at night but it still takes around 50 dollars a month from me that I could use on better things. If you are on the fence about these things, just stay away and use that money on things that will bring you honest joy. My friend quit and she's spends the money she would on vaping on bath and skin care and stuff like that.

*Store Brand is going to be your new best friend*

There are of course, store brand things that just don't cut it, but try to make some substitutions and see that grocery budget go down a lot. For example when I go grocery shopping, I will get store brand pizza rolls (they are 10x better than totinos), cereal, chips, and fruit snacks, pasta, sauces, cleaning wipes, paper towels, etc. most of them are the same and made in the same factory, you'll live. Sodas, hair products, etc I get name brand because those are just my afforded luxuries. 

*Plan those luxuries*

You can budget all you want for necessities but 99% of the time, you will slip up and that okay, we all do it. I decreased this in myself by putting on my calendar budget, 20 dollars on a date night with my boyfriend, or 50 dollars on an Amazon haul on apartment stuff. This just allows me to just be able to have a bit of fun while staying on a budget

*Go off campus as soon as you can*

On-Campus living is very expensive and while you are not paying for it now, you will soon. Most campuses have a 1 or 2 year mandatory dorm living experience but see about getting an exemption or something to get off campus asap. When finding an apartment, skip on the big corporate housing like those 20 building apartment complexes, and find a local, realtor. Ours just owns like 5 2 or 3-unit houses around town and personally takes care of them all. The rent is amazingly cheap, and I live close to campus in an actual house instead of student apartments which tend to be shit often.

*Cut down on Services and Subscriptions*

If you are in college, I know its tempting to get doordash or ubereats but I promise you its not worth it. Go pick up the food if you really wanted to get takeout food. With subscriptions, always look up student discounts. For things like Hulu or HBO, try to set something up with your friends to split the bill, most allow 2-3 people on at the same time so see about spllitng up that 12 dollar Hulu account.

*Be Smart with Drinks*

This is just an nsfw tip but very useful and a little shady. Be safe but try to just get alcohol handed to you. Typically friends will be open to share and just drink what they have or what's handed to you by trusted people, its expensive, I did not pay for alcohol for the first 2 years of college from this.

One of my best friends is doing cyber and I got some insight from him. 
I feel like Cyber would be a better choice for the chance of a good job after college but I also feel like with a finance degree I can get business experience and cyber security or IT certifications later. I know that many IT jobs don't require a degree but do require certifications. 
It would be hard for me to do the reverse as a degree in Finance can't be supplemented by certifications. 
This is why I'm stuck, cyber would also allow me to travel as there are far more remote jobs, as well as provide stable job opportunities that pay well. But finance would provide a key into the world of business and money while still providing decent jobs. 

The ease of finding a remote job or a job overseas is very important to me as I would like to travel and live elsewhere.

3,currentlysylveon,1665186156,/r/college/comments/xydrqc/advice_for_a_newb/,"Good day, thank you for taking your time to read this. I am a twenty-three year old female that dropped out of high-school during my sophomore year. I was very lazy, unmotivated, and had parents that didn't really care or encourage me. I do not blame them, however, as I fully made the decision to drop out because I wanted to play on my phone all day, everyday. I have been working since I was sixteen and now, at twenty-three, have a full-time job as a manager in a grocery store. My department is a specialty department, henceforth meaning if someone calls out, I have to come in. I am also married, have a child, and a plethora of bills where I am unable to change or depart my job. It works out financially, but every week - especially with the way the economy is - I am always under or scraping by at bare minimum.

I got my GED in 2020 and ever since, I have been thinking of college. What I want to do, where I want to go, how I can afford it, how I can balance it with my demanding job. I have decided yet again to look into college, wishing to pursue nursing. I have grappled with this decision for the last year. I know what it takes. I know the sacrifice. I know the difficulty. My mom works for the hospital, my grandmother, my aunts (x3), my sister, my friends. I am also quite smart. I can't toot my own horn, but I am capable of the work. I simply need to dedicate myself, which if money is on the line, I know I can do.

I have many questions. I find it difficult thanks to Covid to get any insight in college. Most people won't meet in person and I need to see someone to understand what they're explaining, so whilst I'm not seeing any of you, I'm hoping someone can help me figure out, basically, how this all works?

First of all; I do not have any money. No savings, nothing. My spouse and I work in the same grocery store and make barely enough to pay our bills. Nothing more. Will student loans/FAFSA/etc pay for it all? And then I just have to pay it back, like a credit card bill?

Second of all; how does it . . . work? Do I pick classes and then just go to classes and pass them? How do I know I'm taking the right classes towards my degree?

Third of all; how do I fit it into my schedule? Night school, sure, but I am worried if I have to miss school for my job, because we go through highs and lows of employees. I've had to cancel many things in the past, but I don't wish for my education to suffer.

And then, simply, anything else you can share. Please Reddit, whatever you can throw at me. I'm all ears - I just want to better my life and the lives of my family.",college,Advice for a newb...,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/xydrqc/advice_for_a_newb/,1665204156.0
4,sillybumbleb,1663918036,/r/college/comments/xlqox9/advice_for_game_dev_majors/,"i’m a freshman in UT Austin, enrolled in a program called AET (stands for Arts and Entertainment Technologies), and it’s marketed as very flexible major depending on the career path you want to go on. the classes range from music and sound design to animation to computer science to game development. this all sounded great, because my dream is to be able to make my own indie game, and while i can take classes to help me with that i can also learn programming and how to make soundtracks so i’m not just experienced in animation, and be able to do a lot of things on my own.

i knew that it was a new major and that it began in 2017, so i was prepared for some level of disorganization as i’m sure the professors and admin still needed to figure out the classes. only being 5 weeks in, i can already tell that “disorganized” is a huge understatement when describing AET.

i went to the UT Austin subreddit to ask about the experiences of others in the major, because i was feeling really underwhelmed by my 4th week and so far the only thing they were teaching us was “mindfulness” and “interactivity”, which sounds interesting but then you start to question what this has to do with game design/animation/etc and ask the professors (i have 3 professors in my introduction to AET and 2 in my design class, and then there’s at least 3 TAs in each), and they respond with “it’ll make sense later”, it puts a lot of doubt on the ability of these professors to actually teach you something helpful. at one point they had us bring in household items and then told us to make something out of them, at the end they told us the point of the exercise was to recreate what it was like for us in preschool/elementary school where our minds were more creative.

i'm not trying to say that what they're teaching is bad, i think doing exercises like that is calming, but it's not something i want to be doing in a class i'm paying $1,000+ for, and instead could be learning something that would be useful for our careers.

essentially, the admin and professors have really no idea what they're doing. according to many other posts in the UT Austin subreddit basically exposing the AET experience, every single year it's been like this, no matter what year you're in. and now it seems that admin is pushing all of the classes towards game development and ""interactivity"" (i had to ask some upper classmen in the major what that meant, and apparently now the admin want to add focus to VR and potentially theme parks). this leaves everyone who started the major for the multiple different paths that were advertised that weren't game development being forced into something that won't help them in the future. on the outside, it sounds like that wouldn't affect me and others who are going down that path, but like i said before, even the game dev classes don't have any focus or goal.

i don't want to blame anyone, i'm trying to understand that this is a new major, and that the admin is still figuring out which direction they want it to go in. but it's leaving all of us confused since they can't give us solid reasoning and lesson plans, and end up throwing away a bunch of classes and adding new ones that no one asked for. 

the lack of passion from the professors is really getting to me. seeing them have no idea what they're supposed to be teaching isn't giving me motivation to continue, and it's even started to influence my performance in my other classes because i haven't been able to take any of them seriously. the whole reason i'm at this college is for a major that apparently doesn't have any structure, and if i'm not learning anything from it, it makes me question what's the point of trying to learn from my other classes if i'm not even there for them in the first place?

i kept holding onto hope and looked into game development as a major in general, and apparently it's a scam. a lot of indie game developers (from what i've seen) have warned students of majoring in game dev because of the way it teaches students. to sum up the big reasons: you waste your money to learn half of the whole process in 4 years instead of spending 2 years to learn how to make an entire video game, it doesn't prepare you for the industry at all and ends up leaving fresh graduates overwhelmed when they get into Nintendo or Riot because they learned how to be decent at too many things instead of being really good at a specific skill.

at this point, i was already spiraling, and after learning how the thing i was majoring in barely helps in the career path i want to go in would lead to me being in debt and with no idea what to do, made me withdraw for almost a week (still recovering from it currently), a pattern similar to many times in school.

near the end of high school, i got diagnosed with ADHD and autism because i noticed that i had been doing a lot worse in my classes. my diagnosis helped me realize that teaching myself everything wasn't normal due to the fact that i couldn't pay attention, and in the rare chance that i could i wouldn't understand anything the teacher was saying. people say that learning how to be independent in your studies in a good skill, but for me it's enforced a mindset that school just isn't for me.

a lot of people drop out because it can be very overwhelming to be learning so many things at the same time, it's hard to balance getting the hang of adulthood with a social life, and managing a job, and going to school and having to learn advanced concepts you've never heard of. hearing peoples' stories of this make me feel like i'm having the exact opposite problem where it's actually underwhelming, and i feel like i could be doing something more impactful on my life.

i'm personally doing pretty okay with the problems i've just listed out. i've never had much of a social life, and i'm okay with that because for me, being around too many people is something that is extremely overwhelming for me, and i've had a lot of public meltdowns that i have since learned to avoid by simply being comfortable in my own space and drawing or playing video games. most of my friends i've made from just working at starbucks, and my best friend of all time i met online when i was first starting my art account. i've been working since i was 16, and have experience in customer service because of my time working at barnes &amp; noble and now (as mentioned previously) starbucks, where i'm getting much better pay and a lot of benefits including free therapy. and like i said before, i've been able to earn a decent amount of money from social media by selling my art. i have almost 50k on tiktok, where my niche is that i make tarot decks inspired by my favorite games. my first deck was an Animal Crossing themed one, and i'm currently making a deck for my all time favorite game: Hollow Knight.

My only problem is school. i'm not learning anything from it, and i know it's not me having trouble with the content, it's because of all the problems i just told you about.

I've been able to learn more about how to make a game in Unity from just this past week of watching YouTube tutorials, compared to the 5 weeks i've spent in my actual game development class, where all we've learned about Unity is how to move a circle around and interact with squares.

i know having a degree is important for 90% of careers, but you don't need a degree for game development or animation to get hired by the big companies. the thing that makes you actually stand out is your portfolio. obviously, the best option is a degree and a good portfolio, as it is rare to be hired solely based on the latter, but i'm sure you would have a better chance of being hired based on a well-developed portfolio where it shows that you have a focus, compared to a degree where all you have to show is a general idea of a bunch of different things, but no real skills in something specific.

the best analogy i've heard is that you would rather have just a hammer that's sturdy and well made, than have a hammer from a hardware kit with many other tools that's not as good. sure, that kit has a bunch of things you could use in the future, but you're probably not going to use them, and if you do need a specific piece of hardware, then you'd just go out and buy a well made and sturdy version of that.

but you can basically forget that whole paragraph because i'm not even planning on going into the big industries. when you make an indie game, you don't need to show yourself that you have a degree and know how to draw, because you know that you know how to draw. marketing is more difficult outside of the big companies, but if you already have your own platform that people know, you can still get some amount of attention, all on your own. i know my platform's not very big, but games take a very long time to make and i'm sure that my account can grow by the time a game that i could make is finished.

i think the only reason i haven't dropped out yet is because everyone i've talked to about this, even after explaining my situation, basically says something along the lines of ""dropping out is bad"". and maybe they're right, but right now my gut is telling me that nothing good is going to come out of me staying here.

i should clarify: i don't mean drop out immediately once i'm sure i've gotten a green light. i'm going to stay till the ends of the semester because i already paid, and i feel bad wasting $6k, and also i still have just the smallest amount of hope that something could happen that will change my mind. emphasis on small, because i really don't think it's going to happen.

if you got this far, i appreciate you taking the time out of your day to read this, and i would love to hear your advice because i'm actually freaking out.




way TL;DR: i'm in a really shitty game dev program that i'm thinking of dropping out of because if i graduate from it, will have learned in 4 years maybe half of what i could learn in 2 of teaching myself. i have been able to make money on my own by growing my art platform on social media and working at starbucks. i'm already in the process of making my own game, i've have everything planned out and have been learning the basics of unity from tutorials online. dropping out and being on my own means i'll have more time to work at the cafe and sell my art online to earn an income while i work on my game, all without the crushing fear of debt.


P.S. before you suggest i just switch majors instead of fully dropping out, i've checked and i haven't found any majors that would suit me, but also like i was thinking of before, school probably just isn't for me.

P.S.S. if i do end up dropping out next semester, and later in life come to realize that actually i would like to go back to school, i think that would be better than having the crisis that i'm having right now for the next 4 years and then later in life realizing that i wasted a bunch of money and actually need to figure out what to do with my life or go back to school or something.",college,advice for game dev majors?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/xlqox9/advice_for_game_dev_majors/,1663936036.0

Cosmo:

I don't know if I have alot of options/paths set up for me. I'm currently in a cosmetology course provided by a program branching off from my school district, called BCAT. (This is my second year.) I can try to get my license, and complete the program next year and that's one option. But I also know it doesn't always pay that well, and it's very time consuming.

Culinary:

Hours are long and if I ever have a family I might not see them much.

I love to cook and bake and I know alot about it and I'd say I'm pretty skilled at it. It just comes naturally to me somehow. I've been doing it independently for years. I started a course at my base school, (Intro to culinary). It's really easy, and it's just basics but it's helping me alot. The base school only has intro to culinary, and anything past that is at BCAT as I've stated earlier. (I'm probably going to take adulting for my 3rd year, and nutrition for my senior year.) I can't take 2 BCAT classes because 1: you have to interview, and it's very hard to get into, and 2: because I have my electives full and BCAT takes up 2 blocks.

Band/marching band:

What are my other options?? Marching band is temporary, and doors shut at age 22-28 depending on where you go (outside of school DCI, etc..)

I'm an average student with around 3.5 CGPA(4 scale). I expect a 1400+ in my October SAT because I have worked so hard for it since last year. I do not have extraordinary ECAs either. Most people in my country chose a lower-ranking community college or university and are working hard to make money or pay university fees completely degrading their college education. I've never cared about my study until now Because I never understood the importance of it and I've always been terrible at education all my life. But now that I started studying for SAT myself, I understood the math and fell in love with what I hated my entire life.

As so, I want to study data science/computer science, but the problem is that my family finances are very bad, they've been through a lot, and I don't want to add to that. I have looked at many YouTube videos and downloaded scholarship guidebook, but they are no help but a waste of time. I think the liberal arts colleges have better scholarships, but there are so many that I don't know which one to add to my list at this stage. And looking at Usnews Website I can't figure out which university will give me a good scholarship. I have no university counselor or or anyone else, and I'm so confused at this point.

If I go to the United States without a good scholarship, I'll get stuck just paying for my college education and not having time to study. At the moment, I just want to work really hard and excel in my education and make me and my parents proud. I need full tuition or a full scholarship if possible.

12,Strawberrypompe,1662617292,/r/college/comments/x8sca8/i_changed_my_major_from_pharmacy_to_english/,"Hi! This is my first post on Reddit and I (desperately) need advice.

     I'm currently a freshman. I started August 16th and my choice of college/major was last minute. My parents have been pushy about me doing something in the medical field since I can remember. Because of this, I convinced myself the medical field is the only way to success and money. 
     The school that I go to offers an accelerated program for pharmacy. You only do 2 years of undergrad and 4 years of actual pharmacy school. I did very little research on it because of the deadline and found that it had good pay and it was quicker than most schools. About 2 weeks in, I realized I had fucked up. The work load is almost unbearable. I'm in 3 labs, a chemistry class (the professor loves to brag about it being the hardest on campus), biology 112, and a calculus class (with a professor that apparently hates lecturing and only offers quick, 3 minute videos about whatever we're taking a test on next). I came from a HS that is very small and back-woods hillbilly. Since our class only had about 20 students, no one seemed to care. I got stuck with teachers that were basketball coach lazy, so I never did a lab or touched a microscope. I learned Geometry from YouTube and science from Brainpop. I took AP and dual enrollment classes my junior/senior year which proved to be the only education I'd receive. In short, I'm doing terribly. 
     I don't even WANT to do the work. I'm not passionate about chemistry, biology, math, or anything medical related. My original plan was to major in English Literature and get a Master Of Library Science. My dream is to become a librarian. I love to read. I love books. I love studying literature. I wrote many papers and stories that took me to writing competitions in other states. But, I listened to my parents and other people tell me that I simply can't get anywhere with an English degree. I've heard there are no jobs, no good pay, no opportunities after college. I've seen Reddit and TikTok posts saying that becoming a librarian just isn't worth it. It apparently wastes your time and money.
     However, the other day, I just broke. I was on the 5th hour of studying metal cations and chromatography at home and it just made me break down. Not only was I not grasping the concept at all, I literally HATED doing it with a passion. I found the department of English at my school the next day and switched my major. I got a new advisor. Yes, I have to finish out this semester with the classes I already have but after December, I'll never have to step foot in another math classroom again and what A RELIEF it is. I'm so excited about my future classes. They all sound like something I would actually enjoy studying. 
     I don't know if I'm questioning myself or letting the negativity get to me, but it's only been 2 days and I've already had ""opinions"" of my choice. They were pretty rude comments about how I just assured myself no career. I'm asking for advice. Should I keep doing what I love for the sake of my heart, or should I force myself to study medicine in order to get a stable career? I don't care about money, I just want to be successful and do what I love. I also don't want to be jobless multiple times in my life, though.

13,Thee_Mad_Catter,1662308358,/r/college/comments/x5qwis/some_money_advice_i_want_to_pass_off/,"As many of you know, college will reck you financially here's some advice that I have.

1. Get a job as soon as possible in high school. Put at least 70% into a savings account for college expenses (NOT tuition).  If possible try to invest 10%-20% into the stock market. I know it's tempting to use all of your job money as spending money, but this is a far better way to manage your high school finances.
2. Scholarships are more powerful than you realize. Most scholarships require an essay about something or other, and that's it. While one $500 scholarship doesn't seem like much, what about 10 $500 scholarships? That's $5000 right there. These essays aren't hard. Pump out 10 or so before the school year and you've got a large chunk payed off immediately. 
3. Remember that 70% from before? This money should NOT be spent on daily life purchases. Don't spend it on groceries, rent, laundry, etc. Instead get a job to pay for all that. If you can't make enough to cover these expenses, this is where that money comes in. I call it a cushion fund. Basically, if something happens to you in college (large medical expense, loss of job for awhile, emergency need to travel, etc.) you aren't screwed on money. You'll have thousands of dollars just sitting there for that purpose. I broke my ankle in college, and this fund saved me from going into debt.

Hey, I'm freshly 20yr old female and I'm quite struggling  to survive on my own.

Just to make things clear, I was kicked out after my grades dropped during quarantine. The Zoom style of teaching/learning just wasnt working for me. It's not like i didnt try. I did try my best and was taking extra classes to somehow pass through. 

I struggled to pass through an I.T. school from the beginning,  since my parent chose the school for me. At my 15 years, I had no idea what I wanted to do in future, so they thought I will have some use of this. 

However , imo it was a big mistake. I struggled with math since elementary school and it kept on going till high school. Not to mention,  I'm from Czech republic so we have different school system. Preschool from like 3 till 6 years, then elementary school from 6 till 15 and then high school which you pick along with the profession that the school is specifically targeted on.

I survived basically until the 3rd grade (From actually 4 grades) and had to survive just one more year. But yeah. It didnt work out and I had to drop out. I tried and wanted to look for a different school with different profession, but my parents dismissed the thought of me starting from the first year.  Instead, they told me to find a job. Which I did. But after all  , it was nothing what you would want to do for rest of your life. I worked at fastfood restaurant (I think everyone will know this one , it pretty much sells the special Kentucky fried chicken) as I had to be paying rent to my parents , buying my own food etc. 

And boy let me tell you it was hell. You always had to check your hours because almost every month, every salary I got, was missing a part. (I got paid hourly) So of course I had to write everything down to have solid proof that my hours got cut so I would actually recieve the money I worked my butt off for. Not to mention,  the pay wasnt anything extra, as I was barely making 20K of Czech crowns a month / Around 800 USD . Might you say it's a lot, but the prices are high here as well. The rent alone cost me pretty much 400$ monthly, the food was around 150$ monthly and I had to get to work somehow. Since I dont have drivers licence yet, I was using the public transport which was overall 70 dollars not to mention to pay for my health and social insurance. So I was left with nothing much as I'm trying to save what I can.

Recently,  I managed to find more decent job, as my dad helped me, since he is basically one of the highest ranked managers in a security company which hires receptionist,  bodyguards and stuff like that. Of course,  I wouldnt get accepted here if it wouldn't be for him, since clearly you need at least finished high school with any profession to work here. The money arent that much better but at least it's a job I really like ,  plus I managed to get a part time job here as well, on my own. I now live with a roomate,  or more like moved over to her since she has her parents house and didnt want to live alone. But it goes get lonely, since we both are spending most of our time at work and never really see each other.

However to finally get to the point. I do actually want to finish my school but I do not know how , nor where or what even are my possibilities.  I tried to apply , but this year, everything's full already. I want to try next year again, but that means I currently have some free time to try and get a driver license or get some course once I'll eventually have enough money, but at the end, I do not know what to really do or what even are my chances and possibilities as I said. 

 I am quite close to giving up and just admitting that I am just another useless member of society which didnt manage to get even her school done - No hate to people like this, as I adore them how are they holding up and the fact you dont have finished degree doesnt mean you can't do amazing things - But I pretty much know that I wont be able to do anything amazing. I'm just average. So I'm turning here to share and ask for help because, I just have no other idea and maybe I am a bit desperate.

\- He incorrectly titled the Quizzes with a different chapter number but its my fault for now paying attention in class that he said the new book was 1 chapter ahead , (How is that my fault your lazy ass can't rewrite the chapter numbers but want a full 5 page essay from me)

\- I tried to tell him I suffer from Depression and Anxiety and to please not force me to make a video and post to the entire class discussion board , He basically told me to deal with it (Even my High School was more understanding)

I tired to complain to the advisor , his supervisors and nobody has send a email back and I'm so tired of this !

18,PillCosby696969,1661803941,/r/college/comments/x0yjya/what_to_do_about_an_unhelpful_toxic_and_racist/,"I've gone back to school, I was looking into business (but already set for nursing), however there is a few classes left to get my Associate of Business of Administration, so I will take a business class here and there. This just took place in a Introduction to Business class at the local community college. This was the second Zoom lecture, they are optional and occur once a week. I missed the first. He makes us show our faces because better class discussion or something. 

I will say now that I am Hispanic and the professor is not white, I won't specify his race to avoid potentially derailing the conversation. I also said he is not white to avoid derailing the conversation. 

The class opens up in a orthodox and practical manner. ""Any questions about the last chapter?"" When that was done, he started the lecture on Chapter 2. He asked if anyone had done an economics class before (as this is a business class and not a economics class strictly) covers supply and demand, asks students some simple concept questions. So far so good, it has been around fifteen minutes. 

Then he asks students about how they feel about minimum wage increases. Assuming this is just going to be a talking point about certain economic factors or just using a common frame of reference, no red flags waived. Instead he goes on how about they are responsible for the rapid inflation in America history since their introduction and they are the worst thing ever. He links to speeches and documentation and basically spends like half an hour on this point. Now whether you agree or not, this is a vast oversimplification of the issue, but this isn't really what the chapter is about. Anytime he calls on a student to get a viewpoint he strawmans what they say if they disagree or only partially agree. There is a lot of let's say hypothetically and prove me wrong energy and actual verbage going on. 

Now I've been in a lot of classrooms physically or virtually, and usually professors try to extract useful tidbits from student responses or least figure out where their viewpoints might be based on even if they disagree or are technically wrong. But there was a lot of ""So you are saying you are for x (point in extreme), or ""you always act on x for every action"" (principle) in an attempt to point out potential hypocrisy for game.

This is getting annoying, but I am here to just get a better understanding of the profs process to do their assignments (the due dates are wrong on Canvas because of course they are). I just looking at nursing program brochure on my computer while the students are doing what students usually do to an expert in their field, which is sheepishly kowtowing. I get it too, some professors take these personal if you debate them at length, and some professors do not always grade fairly if they take things personal. But we have been on this talking point for longer than the actual lecture and that is the bigger issue at this point in time. The professor is annoying and doesn't like minimum wages okay.

The professor continues with talking about how mininum wage jobs were for teenagers as training jobs, and not meant for careers. Minimum wages and unions have forcibly changed that and now teenagers can't get jobs. Like, okay there has been some experience/credential inflation with jobs but now we are getting into Prager U vibes. Also why are we still taking about this?

And then it did turn into a Prager U video. He says minimum wages have lead to decreased employment of Hispanic and Black youth and thus an increase in crime. He says this decrease Hispanic and Black youths is because employers do not hire them because they come from a culture that does not pass on skills. (Employers are racist). Now this is pretty damning, but maybe he is quoting an argument or something. But then asks the question that he has been asking to support any economic concept i.e., ""If producers can sell a good at higher price for more profit, can you blame them?"" Which leads to the expected answer of no. He asks it again, ""Can you blame them?"". This is horrible, the professor is basically justifying discrimination. I and another student says yes, I let the other student speak. He basically says ""lol just kidding."" The moment passes I am stunned, what is happening this morning, this is an intro business class. I don't check the professor, if you want to call me a coward sure I guess I was a coward. No one else says anything, we move on. 

You might be surprised that I didn't leave at this point. I guess I wanted to see what would happen next. He then moves on to the next topic. No, not in the book. Student loan forgiveness. He asks how a girl feels about it, she lists positive and negatives, he strawmans her and implies she is a selfish person. He goes on a blames the loan situation on silly art majors and another student chimes in to say that the situation is more complicated than that but the professor just insists that majority of the reason for the student loan fiasco are people who took unprofitable majors. A student chimes in to say he is happy to pay for it to help others, and the prof just reduces his argument to just get rich. He literally repeats this to everything the student says following that. He then says that student loans are the best. To which I promptly hit the leave button. It has been fifty minutes at that point, fifteen on actual economic principles. 

Look, I am going to get an A in this class, it isn't too hard even if I don't go to lecture. Most of it is automated access code stuff. And yes, maybe I should have checked the professor for his racist discriminatory views. However, I have never had a professor like this before. My old university had students rate the professors anonymously at the end of the semester and I know for a fact that these had serious effects on the professors. This school does not. Ironically the Zoom session is recorded. So it won't be my word against his. Not just for the racist stuff but for the lack of clarity about due dates on Canvas, the unhelpful, tangential, and mean spirited lecture style This is a state community college. Who do I get into contact with? Will I have anonymity? That's not a dealbreaker. What do I do?

So, for background I recently turned 21, and am a few years completely removed from the school experience. I moved into a new area recently and found the school in my state that would be my absolute #1 choice. It has the culture, location, and programs that I would look for, along with in-state tuition and a very very high rank in the field I want to major with as bonuses. When I say this school has literally everything I look for in a school, I mean it.

My high school transcript was FAR below what the school normally takes (mostly due to depression and laziness at the time) but I got BLESSED to get offered a guaranteed transfer after I studied for a good SAT score and had good activities. 

The Issue comes in this fall 2022 semester. I needed 30 credit hours and certain classes by June 2023 to complete the transfer, so I found a community college that offers all of the classes in my state around the summertime (late I know, I wasn't taking it seriously because I knew a bunch of schools that still accepted applications late summertime even into early august). Due to applying so late I registered for all the classes I needed but didn't know I needed to test into a certain class (let's just call it MATH 1) if I didn't take the class in high school. Mind you, I need to take MATH 1 and MATH 2 for the transfer. A couple days go by with me calling the person in charge of testing because I had a ton of questions I needed answered about the process and getting voicemail every call, and I decide ""eh its whatever, I can take MATH 1 at a different school come spring 2023 and test into MATH 2 at the school I currently go to and just take them both the same semester. I thought I had everything figured out until I get an email a few hours ago saying, ""hey btw if you don't pay $1,600 by tomorrow 1pm your entire schedule will be deleted"", and funnily enough, the website where you can see all of your fees and loans etc is completely down? or something? I can't access it, and I won't be able to call until tomorrow because the school is closed. A lot of thoughts went through my mind ""I had already filled out the FAFSA shouldn't the school know I'm paying with that?"" ""Even if I paid with money, I don't have Id still have the MATH 1 problems"" etc etc etc. And yeah, I know that these questions have answers I would've known if I didn't rush. But I did, so I was completely ignorant.

I honestly just screwed myself over ROYALLY. I just wanted to enjoy my last free couple of days in summer, apply for a community college, and do the coursework they give me. But because I rushed the whole process, I didn't realize a TON of extra stuff that I needed to prepare for and handle WAY ahead of time. Even if there was a way to salvage my fall 2022, because I was so rushed and last minute, I barely know how to navigate the 50 different portals they gave me, which is frustrating because the actual coursework (at least what I've seen of it) is even easier than I thought it would be. Not to mention that I still barely know about the financial aid process and how ANY of it works, along with a ton of other things about the college process in general. I would've taken it more seriously if it was the school I actually wanted to go to, but it wasn't, so I really rushed the entire process. It was dumb of me.

I think at this point I only have 3 solutions (that I know of).

* Try to find another school that's still accepting fall 2022 (23 days into august lol) and start the process over
* Say screw it and forget fall 2022 and forget this school. Get a job and work until spring 2023, quit my job (because I live with family so I can do that) and enroll in 2 schools at once and work 30 credit hours. (Completely absurd workload but would solve my MATH 1 problem because I could take MATH 1 and MATH 2 at two different schools)
* Say forget the guaranteed transfer altogether. Enroll into a decent school I can actually get into, and Spring 2023 take regular course classes. Roll the dice as to whether I actually get into my first choice. (Absolutely the easiest option but I'd be throwing away one lucky break I had)

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly even if you don't have any advice to give me, thanks for reading because it felt good to type out. I'm normally a guy that can roll with all the punches and find a quick solution when I'm knocked off my feet, so it really sucks to just have to sit and accept that there aren't any quick fixes.

Hello everyone! This is also cross-posted in the FAFSA sub but this one seems more active. 

I just received an email from my community college stating there had been a change to my financial aid. I logged it and it appears that my entire unsubsidized loan offer was converted into a work-study award. Does anyone know any information about this/had this happen to them? I definitely don't mind the idea of working instead of taking out a loan, but I literally can't even work enough hours to collect it all at the pay rate my school offers (which as a single parent working part-time and in school full-time, every penny counts!).

For reference, I attend a large community college in Colorado and am on track to graduate with an associates after the Spring semester and start classes on Monday 8/22/22.

Due to poor choices from when I was younger and not as serious about school, I'm in bad academic standing with the school. Which means I'm not eligible to receive financial aid. One option I had was to make an appeal, which I initially did back in May. But as of now I have not received an official answer. I've sent multiple emails and made numerous calls leading up to this date, but no avail. I made one last call yesterday and they basically told me I'm fucked if I can't pay for the semester out of pocket. 

I tried looking at private loans at popular lenders like Sallie Mae, but they don't offer loans for my school. I guess you can't get private loans for a community college, so another option I looked at was transferring to a university early. That way I could have access to private loans, but upon looking at the admission requirements for a couple universities I found that I have to be in good academic standing with my current school to transfer, which I'm not. 

All my life I struggled with apathy, depression, and making life goals. I recently found something I wanted to achieve (finishing college). I returned to school in the Spring and I had [a solid semester](https://i.imgur.com/O51A1Jg.png). I found myself much happier in college than I ever have in my adult life. But without any pocket money, aid, or private loans, finishing is just an unrealistic goal now. A pipe dream. Now that the college dream is dead, I have to dreadfully return to my blue collar work. A miserable, unfulfilling, hell.

I did a little research for my area because I wanted to pick one that wasn't too expensive, but also was close so if I wanted or needed to attend some classes in person, I would have that option. I looked at Bucks county, Philadelphia county, and Delaware County. Bucks seemed to be the cheapest and closest but I just signed up for 3 classes (part time minimum) and the total was $2778. I thought classes were about $500 on average, not $900. This was almost double what I expected to pay and now I'm freaking out a little because I only saved $5000 to start with. 
I haven't applied for scholarships yet but it looks like most say you have to be a full time student, which I can't afford! 
And yes the FAFSA basically gave me nothing because my dad makes 100k annually and apparently they don't take into account that we are a family of 8 so I get NOTHING from him.  

Do I cancel my payment and try to figure it out for the spring semester?? CAN I cancel a payment if I do so before school starts?

Going into my senior year of high school, I only had two okay friends remaining and neither had made any effort to come to even my birthday so I sat alone in the basement with my mom eating way too big of a cake together. I started a pre-program at a small liberal arts school yesterday and had all but 30 seconds to say goodbye to my family after my move-in time had been done. My mom intends on driving the hour back to see me during the normal student orientation, however, I was scheduled to help others move in during the only time I could see her. I cried the majority of the night last night. I went random for my roommate praying I'd get what I asked for, a single, but instead, I got an international student who has no interest in speaking with me and is gone most of the day with other friends from the same county. I might wait until classes start but being in these forced groups that continue to purposefully exclude me is getting to me. Before anyone says ""girls are mean, no matter what age"", I really feel like I'm sitting alone at a lunch table again in middle school right now. I requested a room change even if it means I have to pay more for housing, but otherwise, I don't think I can continue like this healthily. I can't believe I miss the familiarity of high school but I do. If orientation wasn't mandatory, I'd go home this weekend.

26,alenamalina,1660517737,/r/college/comments/woj8c6/adding_a_major_senior_year/,"So I'm in a bit of a weird situation. Last year, my major changed its requirements about two weeks after the drop add period and I basically finished my major first semester of junior year, and finished my degree requirements last semester. But I really didn't want to graduate early at all. First off, I had really bad mental and physical health issues, and I had actually been trying to take the past two years off for that specifically but my parents did not let me. Why I listened to them I'm not sure, since I pay for college and rent myself with financial aid and multiple minimum wage jobs. This was incredibly difficult, at one point I ran out of money and couldn't afford food, and I started having daily panic attacks and a couple of strokes because of it. But also, part of me was mad at my shitty three years of college and I wanted to have a normal year. I knew this year's tuition would be covered by financial aid and scholarships so financially it wouldn't even be that bad of a decision.

Regardless, I'm going into my fourth year majoring in International Relations. When I was making decision I also thought, hey this will be cheaper and better than paying rent at home and job hunting for a field that I know I cant get a job in yet because I don't have enough experience or connections. I can work and save up for my last year and continue to network, especially since the IR field really needs connections and college was online for year and a half.

But the problem is, I... kind of hate my major. I've hated probably since about second semester sophomore year and I've been too stuck mentally to change it. I know, it's completely my fault and I have to deal with the consequences of my actions, but it still sucks. I originally wanted to get a masters in IR and work for a think tank or for the state department, or maybe work for a nonprofit. At first I actually liked the major until I started learning about the corruption in the field. Honestly idk what I expected. I went to college to learn, not to necessarily train for a job. 

Now.. I just want financial stability. After being abused and harassed at my minimum wage jobs for so long I can't stand being financially unstable and I don't want a job that pays $40k after obtaining a graduate degree. When I first went into this my parents actually promised to pay for half my tuition and rent, but because of family issues I had to start supporting myself starting sophomore year. That shit is incredibly fucking difficult on around $11-12 an hour, especially when jobs refuse to give you enough hours. I am tired of working hard for terrible pay. Basically, after going from a family that was relatively well off to struggling to survive, my priorities have shifted. I no longer want to help people for work and I'd rather do some job I tolerate and do what I enjoy outside of work, including activism and learning about politics.

I've found that the only thing I really enjoy in this major is data analysis and research. I think working with R is fun and I never understood why people were struggling with it. This past summer I did some RA work for my professor and I'm doing my own research project this semester, and I'm also working as an RA for another professor.

So I've thought about a relatively different career path as a data scientist. I like working with numbers and I feel like this will make me a livable wage. I've thought about adding an information science degree, since it'll give me the skills I need to get into this field. But I've also thought about going into grad school. Here's where I'm unsure. Should I basically get a second bachelors in information science and go into data science, or should I just whatever classes I can in programming (like for R, SQL, and python), learn the rest on my own, and apply to grad school for data science? Or, can I learn these on my own and get a job in data science with just my bachelors in IR?

In terms of cost, I have this year's tuition and living accommodations covered, but I'm not sure that I'll get aid for my fifth year. I know I can potentially get a local scholarship and maybe a few grants, an interest free loan from a local scholarship, and I know that since this isn't technically my second bachelors I can also get loans from FAFSA. I've also thought about bootcamp, but to be honest its more expensive than what I would pay for one year at my state  university.

Is it worth the time and investment? Or am I just fucking stupid",college,Adding a major senior year,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/woj8c6/adding_a_major_senior_year/,1660535737.0
27,AlternateAccount66,1660353432,/r/college/comments/wn1k0h/just_failed_a_firstyear_math_class_when_it_was/,"Honestly, I'm terrified of what comes next. 

I had a very rough first year, failing about half of my courses, even when being put on disability for the second semester and having my course load reduced to three classes a semester. My GPA is already pretty low because of that. One of those classes I failed was a Calculus class, which I took and passed in highschool. I failed it *twice*.

So I took a break from it, rationalized that I could always take it again later, and took a different math class, a Logic class that was also part of my first year curriculum, but that I never managed to get around to. I took it along with a computer programming course in the summer.

Well, halfway through the semester, I drop out of the programming course, I'm terrible at it and not understanding anything, and the second assignment was approaching with me having no progress on it despite getting an extension and spending weeks on it. I ONLY have the math class to focus on then.

I get a tutor for it, twice a week. I commune with the prof regularly and have him do extra help sessions, as well as attend his normal ones. I made sure to stay focused, I studied a lot, I rewrote old midterms and finals. I even did all the dumb hippie stuff like going on evening jogs to clear my head and manage my stress, making sure to get perfect, consistent sleep, and made my own food which I made sure to keep as healthy as possible. Hell, halfway through the course, my laptop broke and I had to use a school one, not getting it fixed until recently, so I had no video games to distract myself or whatever.

And most importantly, which I tried to stop but couldn't, and STILL feel incredibly bad for... my mom basically learned the curriculum alongside me, even though I kept telling her not to worry about it, and acted as a second tutor, essentially.

I did all the work, never didn't hand something in, got fairly high marks on all the assignments, my marks over the 3 miderms kept going up and up and up with each one I wrote. My teacher was amazing and super helpful too. I didn't run into any unexpected troubles or struggles during the summer. Literally everything was set up for an amazing success.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh and I ended up failing the class. I'm pretty sure I'm going to go on academic probation now. I have a feeling I won't be able to get off of it. I've genuinely started to accept I'm not smart enough for university, and am an inherently stupid person (don't pretend they don't exist). I literally have nothing else I want to do in life, and I hold education in the highest regard possible; regardless of any arguments you could make, if I can't get a university degree, I will never respect myself ever. 

But, I can't pursue this if it's a lost cause, because for each year I'm still here, accomplishing nothing, my parents have to work for another year to support it. Or, I could get a job to try and support myself, but if this semester has taught me anything, that means I'll just fail my classes even harder. And I have no skills to get a job that'll pay for rent in the same city the university is in, even.

This coming school year I also have a 15hr a week internship. I'm planning on taking a gap year before going back for a masters degree (the program I'm in offers an accelerated master's program for people that completed their undergrad at this university, so I can finish my master's in one year). (I'm in the U.S. by the way)

I'm really worried about being able to manage finishing a graduate degree while working full time. This undergrad degree feels like it's killing me, but I really can't do anything with this degree, I need a master's to even use it. I don't have the option to not work full time.

Ultimately, I ended up not knowing what process I needed to take and instead of transferring to a school closer to home the coordinator for my program said I would have to drop out if I wasn't able to come because the program had already started.

In high school I was a 4.0 GPA kid with my grades as my pride and joy. I was in clubs, programs, stem, certifications, I worked my self into being enough. I thought entering college would be difficult but not something I couldn't handle in due time. But with every coming semester I've been bring back a majority of F's. I feel like a complete disappointment to everyone around me.

I've felt nothing but shame every time the discussion of college or grades come up. For my last two semesters I've had to have a hard talk with my parents when seeing my worst grades as of late. We amended as I promised I'd do better. Come this semester, I haven't changed. One class I passed but still. It seems I've made nothing but bad chooses since I stepped outside the comfort on a sustainable education. I doubt I can find a way to dignify myself to my family. They put their faith in me to going to college and I spit in their face with my grades. This may be my last semester without FAFSA, as of late they've been able to pay for all my classes. We're not well off. This semester Im afraid with now that my parents will have to pay and I'd just be sinking deeper and deeper. I doubt there could be any advice for me as I've sinked so low. I don't wanna say "" It could have been worse"" cause its not. It's much worse. 

The more guilty I feel the more isolated I've become. Soon as I start sinking in a class I run away and hide in the library or not step foot on campus. The only people I can talk to are my parents and brother. I feel so alone. 

My parents engraved in my head that there is nothing but college in my future. I can't survive without it. My brother who has taken a rough path when it came to college still sees nothing but the good kid I was. I've become a leach to my family and I am sick of myself. I am disgusted, a hypocrite, and a waste . Theres no ""woe, is me"". I can't blame this on the trauma and abuse my parents put me through. And I can't let them keep enabling me. 

I don't do drugs. I don't drink. I don't hop beds. And I don't waste my money. Thats all I have left. The only joy and aspirations I have had was my job as a kennel technician. I loved every moments in there. The people I've met, the dogs I got to care. The work was hard and draining but I loved it. I'd sometimes come back home just to eat and sleep. However, to my parents it not a priority. And I get it.  They said now I have to quit. But I'm not sure myself about college. 

Not saying I'm gonna drop out. Its what's expected of me. And I can't just ""follow my heart."" ""You know yourself"". I'm a first generation second born 19 year old with two immigrant parents. I can't rely on my brother either. He's got his own family, I'm the least of his worries. I don't know what to do.

Luckily, I don't have to pay upfront.

However. If I do go, that takes two weeks out of my time to work this month which makes it even harder to make back and pay what I owe this month.

And even if I don't go, I will still have to ad if I did...

If I don't go, I can pay off my late rent and the rest of my expenses. But I will still be charged for the Equidor trip and have to pay that later.

But, if I do go, all expenses together, I'll be short about even hundred dollars this month for my living expenses and likely won't have an apartment anymore.

The obvious choice is not to go. But it still hurts that I will still have an extra five grand I owe for a class I dropped...",college,Money trouble with a crazy solution,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/weua3r/money_trouble_with_a_crazy_solution/,1659511264.0

I've been a part time and/or off and on college student since I was 17, I'm 23 years old now. I've made decent progress towards my academic requirements, and I know what I want to study and have a general idea of what I want to do with my life, but I'm feeling very drained and dissatisfied with my university. Nothing incredibly bad has happened here, I've enjoyed my classes I've taken for the most part, but I hate the area I live in and I just wish I could go to a different university.

I'm going to a state school, I previously attended another university in my state and I enjoyed my time there a lot more than I do right now, but this was during the height of COVID and I ended up falling into a deep depression, which led to a snowball of different things and caused me to have to drop out. I was pretty much forced to go to my current university so I could keep receiving fin aid money, which I'm depending on in order to pay rent and other bills. On top of that, I'm not sure when I'll be running out of financial aid, but from what I've been able to find out through my fafsa account, it may be before I am able to complete my degree.

I've been doing better despite another bout of depression earlier this year, but I just don't know if I could keep going here for another 2+ years. I've had to give up a lot of academic interests while going here because the university doesn't have a lot of programs in my interest area, or they do but they require being an online student (which costs more money than in state tuition for no good reason).

 The main thing keeping me here at my current university is my job that I have here (which I can't do without being a student here) and not having anywhere else to go. My family is not well off, I'm going to college entirely through fafsa loans and small amounts of grants and scholarships, which makes it difficult to transfer anywhere else. I also can't live with my parents, I could if I absolutely have to but I'm avoiding it for a reason. I've been told a lot before that I should probably just take a gap year or something similar, but financially I just can't, I don't have the luxury to go to an out of state school or take a year off to think about things.

Feeling extremely elanxopus and overwhelmed about the whole process of going to college, being on top information relating to major, my dorm, meal plans, setting up a job, setting up infusion at a the hospital nearby, applying for financial aid through the closest nearby hospital, shopping for my dorm, but most importantly school fianancial aid and loans. 

I don't have an exact price of how much this year will cost, but I know either way I have to get a private loan, as federal loans don't cover it. I'm really trying my best trying to get everything set up and to ensure I will be okay financially after college. I took community college but due to the degree I'm going into I have to take 3 years here, which would cost me about $65,000 in total. I know that I might be able to get scholarships and grants for the other 2 years, but this year I was only able to get a single small scholarship, as my efc wasn't low enough to be where I was awarded a Pell Grant. 

What sucks is that they expect my family to help pay for college when I am on my own, and telling them means nothing. It scares me having to take out a private loan with such a massive price, I have a budgeting plan that could ease the pain, making $200 monthly payments and applying all future/currentnscholarships/grants to it. However, I do not.knownhow I can get a private loan as my parents can't act as cosigner and I don't have a credit score. I try my best at taking care of things, but when I discuss it with my parents it makes me feel like the work I put into it amounted to nothing, or that I'm terrible that I did not consider something or know about something because it did not cross my mind as this is entirely new to me.

I really want to go as I'm very passionate about the degree and I think I would be in a better position financially compared to finding a job in the field with only an associates degree.

The title sort of says it all here. I'm going to be a senior in high school this fall, but I've been taking CCP (college credit plus) courses non-stop for the past three years. If I don't mess anything up, I should be graduating 2023 with an honors diploma and associate of arts degree. My parents sort of forced me into them, and ever since I was a sophomore, I've been taking fall, spring, and summer classes at my community college instead of going to high school.

After two years of this, I'm now going to be a senior in high school, and I just feel completely burnt out. I never seem to get my work done on time, always asking for extensions, and piling up missing assignments. For example, I took one statistics course and am missing seven homework assignments and a plethora of lectures, and the summer semester ends in two weeks. In other classes, I don't have time to do the required studying, so I end up using the notes or googling to supplement my answers. I know that it's really bad, and I could get expelled or worse if I get caught, but I also know that if I fail then I'll have to pay for the course. My family isn't in the financial situation to do any of that, and I don't make enough money on my own to do it. 

The worst part of all of this is that my parents treat me like some sort of show dog, parading my ""accomplishments"" to others without them really knowing how it is. I can't ever tell them the truth, because then they would realize that I've been lying to them for ages. They're now forcing my younger brother to follow this path, and I don't want him to end up dealing with the stuff I've gone through. Semester after semester of loaded courses, no breaks longer than at the most two weeks, all nighters due to homework building up- you name it. I couldn't even go to prom with my friends because I was so busy doing make-up work from a school trip I took. 

There are days when I don't even feel like trying anymore. If I don't do all of my work, and pass a class with a ""B"" or higher, why should I even keep going to school? Why should I even keep living if I can't handle a basic class. 

I'm so burnt out, and feel like I'm stupid for not wanting to do my work. But, work is all that I seem to do now. I can't focus, am always stressed, and most of my friends have stopped talking to me due to how busy and cranky I've become. When I'm not working, I'm on my phone stressing about finals and other missing assignments. People look at the things I'm doing and think that it's an easy way to get ahead, but I'm living in hell on earth right now. I've wasted two summers now working part-time and taking courses that don't have enough time to teach me anything. I just want a fucking way out.

In my college there are a few spots where if you have no failed exams you don't have to pay for college (idk if it's called tuition, no idea) and I had one failed exam. Other than that one, I mostly had good grades. Today I got the list of the ones who got admitted for those spots, and of course I wasn't between them, so it seems that I have to pay for the whole college year for the 2nd year in a row, hooray! Since I wasn't among them in the 1st year either. 

And it killed me. There were people with lower grades than me up there. There were people who cheated and they were up there. I failed one exam because it was really difficult and because of it now I have to feel like shit. 

Just so you know, I'm not a very wealthy person, and since now I have to get money for freaking college I can't do anything else. And it sucks. All of my hard work to avoid this was useless. I feel so mad and frustrated like I am a loser that couldn't do one simple thing aka to pass a mere exam. And I feel so angry about this.

How is it so easy for others and not for me?? Sorry for venting in here but I literally have no others to tell and I just can't keep this frustration in myself anymore. I had feelings like this as well during the school year but I thought I'll make it. I did not. I know I might seem that I'm overreacting for such a small thing but it just makes me feel like a failure. Like I studied until I got tired to do literally anything else?? 

I don't know, I feel like either changing colleges (but beside this one I don't feel like any other one would suit me better) or dropping out, but that means I'll never get a good job anywhere without a diploma. And it kills me and I really don't know what to do.

But, you know, I've been putting off work for the past few years, and now I guess it's kinda late. I know I'm very late to the game, and honestly, I'm not even sure whether it warrants distress on my part or not. I don't know... I've just kept hearing about a lot of my friends and peers in HS talk about working this job, that job, multiple jobs, and happily and steadily raking in dozens of bucks per hour.

And... I just didn't know. On one hand, I kinda wanted to work, because it's one of those ""quintessential"" rites of passage in life. (I'm bad at fulfilling many of these btw) Yet on the other hand, I found myself unable to shake this feeling of burden, seeing as school and clubs were kinda already taking enough of a tremendous toll on me (mentally?). I just didn't know if I was ready/prepared for the full commitment towards a ""real"" job. Also, I didn't really have many places to spend money on. (I wouldn't say it's because my parents spoil me though, it's not like we're super rich.) And guess what, before I knew it I kinda flew through junior year, then senior year. And I remained preoccupied with keeping my grades/GPA up and club involvement (not even sure about the latter). I don't think I really had time for a bunch of the aforementioned rites of passage: prom date, let alone a gf; car, funny senior events/traditions, hanging out or partying with friends... and of course, the job. About a month ago I actually did try to get a job at the school, and the pay was actually pretty decent (17/hr), but alas I didn't get it. Must've not been qualified enough, or bungled the interview. Ah well fml.

I wonder if it's because I got my driver's license late (waited almost a whole year after my 16th birthday to even start learning). And it's not like I have enough friends willing to help drive me around and everything. (r/fuckcars and r/suburbanhell, rejoice!) Or potentially COVID, because in 2020 I was a sophomore and that's when most people do get their jobs... but what about my peers? I feel like I'm finding excuses left and right to avoid shifting the onus onto myself, so guilty.

I feel like I'm turning into one of those crusty anti-work basement dwellers. I'm also *possibly* neurodivergent so that might factor into things? (Is the whole ""85% of adults with autism are unemployed"" thing accurate?) But the bottom line is, I'm a bit worried that I'll be at a striking disadvantage when I come into college without any real work experience whatsoever. I mean, if I really wanted to I could probably squeeze in a few shifts in August but that's just ridiculous and not worth it. I don't know though. I'm hoping that being pitted up against all those budding entrepreneurs in college won't force me too strongly to play second fiddle, but if it does, then, well, what can I do? High school's already over, it's too late, you can't go backwards in time. Well, at least any freshmen and sophomores hanging out on this sub for whatever reason get to hear a cautionary tale, I guess.

I have been debating if I should quit my job before the fall semester starts so I don't end up in the same position. I know it sounds crazy to do both but I have many reasons for working full time and quitting my job is a HUGE financial risk for me, unfortunately. 

The reason I work full time is because I'm currently living on my own. I'm an older student (26) and only have about a year to a year and half left of school before I graduate with my bachelors. I don't have the option to live with my parents and I have no trust fund or any financial help. One of the biggest reasons I'm rushing to get my bachelors is because I've been stuck in stressful customer service retail jobs for the past 10 years. I have tried to get a job in my field (digital marketing) for years but everything requires bachelors degrees or 5+ years of experience. My only way at this point out of retail is to graduate. With paying for rent (split with my BF), bills, and a car on my own it would be giant risk to leave a full time job. Before anyone suggests, my BF unfortunately doesn't make a TON either and can't pay for my share of the rent as well but he helps when he can. 

The biggest reason I'm considering this now is because I was offered a marketing internship recently. This would give me job experience so I could land a good job after graduation but it is unpaid for 6 months. I told the person who offered me the internship my situation and she was pretty shocked that I was trying to add an internship on top of a full time job and school. I figured I would spend my only 2 days off at the internship and do all my school work during any free time I had. I realized that I couldn't even handle things without the internship so it might not be a good idea, mentally and physically. 

Right now I have the option to live off on my student loans while I do this internship and I'm wondering if it is worth it in the long run since this is an investment in myself for a better job in the future even if it means I may be struggling financially for awhile? The last semester I failed some classes and I was a straight A student in the past. I also would have to risk losing my insurance because now I have many health issues that were resulted from the stress last semester and I wouldn't be able to continue treatment for awhile unless I could get medicaid (I live in the US so no free healthcare :( ). If anyone has advice on this or if they can confirm that going to school and focusing on this internship will be worth it in the long run vs sacrificing my mental health for a toxic customer service job even if it means giving up financial stability?

&amp;#x200B;

The question that bothers me a lot is why students don't really care about the environment anymore? There are many lectures and workshops at schools and colleges about the environment! Students have to write essays on this topic and do different school projects related to this issue. You can't even imagine my frustration!

I live in Canada, and maybe many of you are aware that you can have a separate apartment in the basement in many Canadian houses. It has a separate entrance, and you barely see your neighbors. Many people find it convenient to sublet a place below for some extra cash. Having an apartment in the basement was our last criterion when we looked for a house to buy. Besides, subletting it to different people helped us pay for our mortgage faster.

&amp;#x200B;

We usually rent these places to students. We don't live too far away from the city and the university campuses. We charge low prices compared to the places downtown, and I've also had some extra noise isolation system installed, knowing that some students might as well be party animals. The only thing I didn't consider is that some of them can be pigpens.

&amp;#x200B;

Today we got the keys back for our basement from one of the tenants. When we came to check it out, it was a nightmare. It will take ages to clean up all this mess. You can't even imagine how awful and dirty this place looks now. The funny thing is that before I checked the apartment, I was browsing Amazon for some things for the home and ran into this can smasher. I thought, what the point of getting a can smasher just for a few cans. But, just look at this pile left in one of the corners and think that I might need to of them.

The reason I want to get my MBA is because I am 21 right now and I want to get a stronger education. Although I did well in high school and in college (thus far), sports were my main focus. During the last year I really started to enjoy learning and have been considering my long term life goals and they have changed quite a bit. 

I want to really indulge in the business world and pursue politics after 45. I want to continue learning for a few more years as I feel like there is a lot more room for growth.

I don't really want to move because I have a life here and I don't want to have such a huge distance between me and my boyfriend but it's tearing me apart. Besides that the tuition fees are literally 10 times the amount of what I would pay here and I would have to loan the money. I don't want to disappoint anyone but I just want it so badly.

Education was never my strong suit ig. But as it stands, from the two years I attempted college, I have racked up a GPA of 0.9, 10k student loans, I think 30 W's on my transcript and unable to attend another college in my state(NY). It's been a few years. I know this was a major screw up, I realize now, I wasn't in the right major(Computer Science) and what I'm passionate about is Psychology and at the time I was going through alot such as my parents separation, my friends all moved away, and the beginning of covid shutdowns &amp; policies leaving me without any kind of real support system. Now it's been a few years later, and I'm unable to receive anymore federal loans, I can't find a job making more than 15 an hour which isn't enough to pay for tuition out of pocket with the skyrocketing living expenses here. I just don't know what to do. 

I realize this is the result of my own failures. But does anyone know how I can possibly afford college? I've tried explaining my situation to the school and they reject my appeals. It's just unfair that I have to suffer the rest of my life for screwups I made when I was a teenager.

This program wasn't my first choice, as  I didn't really want to attend college in the first place unless it was for art. However, I was living in a semi-independent home after a rough situation and the staff there encouraged me to pursue this program as it had low requirements and I wouldn't have to pay since the government is covering all if not part of the tuition for PSW and Nursing.   
A couple of months into it; I've learned I really don't like it. The amount of work they throw at students in this program is insane. For all of my classes, I do a quiz and a whole overview of the unit at home to be prepared for the class, and all the tests and quizzes are done at home.  This program since it's in Healthcare is required me to have a bunch of my boosters, shots, doctor's prescriptions, training ect; That all has to be done by a set deadline. So far I've gotten everything in, but now they're asking I finish training (45 modules; around 30 mins each), get my flu booster, in a span of 10 days, while I do work for my other classes (7 total), and finish another test that's worth 20% of my overall grade within that span as well.  
I've noticed I've been really overwhelmed and have had days that I've been so anxious that I can't leave my apartment. I lost a lot of will to do things I normally do, I can't go out anymore since I'm either working or at school/doing homework, and if I'm not doing those I'm usually sleeping/doing basic care needs. I feel at a lost for what to do, if I drop out I'll be seen in my family as a quitter and disappointment,  but this job that I could get from doing the program would solve a lot of my money issues.   
However I don't think putting my mental health in the gutter is the way to go either. I thought about going to therapy but it's a lot of money and I only work part-time, and what I do get paid goes to rent and living expenses.

51,Cannaricks,1654585535,/r/college/comments/v6ozyy/if_this_is_the_first_time_youre_seeing_this/,"Hello it’s the first time I use this but I’m at a point where I don’t really know what to do. I attended San Diego City college and last semester I had a horrible experience. I took only 2 classes (and their corresponding labs) because I wanted no excuse to not pass. The first class intro to Digital Circuitry and I got an A, as well as in the lab. Though the second class DC electronics was a different story. The professor had one “lecture” zoom session a week that consisted of the question, “does anybody have any questions? No? Ok see you next week”. These would last about 20 mins long. The professor would post 3 videos, 2 hours long per week with the information we’d need to be teaching ourselves. One class I told her I was really having a hard time grasping so much information and that the video lectures weren’t doing it for me and if there were any other resources I could use I’d love to know what they were. She then asked, ""(name) is this this semester the first time you're seeing this material?"" i reply ""well yes this is the first time I take this class I'm sure like the other 5 student here"", ""If it's the first time you're seeing this material I don't even expect you to pass."" the class went silent, and I felt discouraged. I then asked ""so why are you even teaching this class if you expect your students to fail? Why is City college offering this class?"" She then states ""Well (name), because of Covid, not enough students are enrolling to classes this semester, therefore in order to keep this program alive (the Technology department) they've compressed 3 courses into this one class."" After this class I stopped attending, and the funny this is she waited until 2 days after the drop date to share this information.

I then searched for a way to clear this class from my transcript and found a petition ""if you think your class has been affected by Covid submit this petition"" I wrote a letter, submitted it, waited a week and noticed they had added the Vice president. I then waited another week and he denied my petition. I immediately emailed him requesting an explanation. It's obvious this is unethical considering the class was unpassable. They didn't respond for 2 weeks to I sent a follow up requesting an explanation. To which they sent, ""we denied your petition because your professor denied to ever making those statements.""

This is where things get complicated, I had a tendency of screen recording the lectures because I needed all the help I could get. I unfortunately didn't get the part where she said all the above statements but I do have a part where she said ""I truly believe this material should be taught in 3 semesters."" I want to submit it as a response but at the beginning of the semester I told both my professors I was video recording the lectures as an extra help study tool, in the class I got an A in my professor was pleased and said ""anything to help you pass"" though this professor said, ""you do know it's illegal to record someone without their permission right?"" such polar differences...

Should I send them the clip of her stating ""I truly believe this material should be taught in 3 semesters."" or would this just get me into trouble? I really think this is unethical and wrong. I use FAFSA to help pay for school and this grade is destroying half my GPA, the worst part is the head of the tech dept is retiring this year, and she's supposed to take his place. Also because of Covid I can't go to the school to talk to anyone because no one is there. Everyone is home. I would love to know what you think.

F22. I was 19 when I took my initial major at my dream uni. Hated it so I had to transfer and I finally decided to take civil engineering but had to repeat freshman year again at 20. I was heartbroken at the time bc I had to leave my dream uni so I failed my freshman 2nd-semester subjects. I was on probation during my ""2nd  year"" and had to re-take those classes, causing me to get left behind (my parents didn't know about it).

I managed to pull through but the uni told me that I'm far behind compared to my actual batchmates in engineering (they're all incoming 3rd year this august) while I'll only be taking my 2nd-year subjects this incoming new school year so I don't think I'll graduate on time sadly.

It kinda sucks but I can live with it (I can learn &amp; acquire different skills &amp; maybe gain some experience for the meantime), but the problem is with my parents (especially my dad). They didn't know I failed my freshman year 2nd semester, causing for me to get delayed. They just know I'm an incoming 3rd year college rn and getting close to graduating.

I can't tell them I failed bc my dad is at the point rn where he's just waiting for me to ""fail &amp; give up"" once again just like I did in my past major &amp; uni and just be bum in the house and fully depend on him like my stepsiblings does (they never graduated highschool/college, never had regular jobs, and still live w my dad. they're in their 30s already). I'm scared that if I told him that I failed, he'll lose faith in me altogether and decide not to pay for my college anymore (not from US btw. in my country, its still quite the norm for the parents to pay for their kids' college)

I'm passionate about civil engineering and realized that this path really is for me, but I failed that one-semester bc I was overwhelmed. with extreme burnout, leaving my dream uni &amp; friends, shame, and the constant negative opinions of my own relatives about my that ""I'm not smart and good enough"" for my dream uni. My mental health was extremely bad as I also had no one to confide w and I felt like almost everyone around me is against me and just waiting &amp; manifesting for me to fail. I'm not weak enough for anything. I know I'm smart and capable.

I grew up around extremely toxic relatives who mostly never have college degrees/highschool diploma (NOT that its a bad thing of course! its just that they also never have decent jobs &amp; depend on my also toxic grandparents + my mom to provide stuff for them and blame everyone for their lives) so I'll be the first one to graduate college &amp; first one to be an engineer in both sides of my family.

They take pleasure in seeing me fail. Even my older step-siblings from my dad (from his first wife) also don't like me and blame ME for how their lives turned out (idek why these people are like this. they've been alive wayy before I was even born. they had their chances, opportunities, and own privileges. they just chose not to use them)

I never really had a support system from my family growing up. I was gaslighted and invalidated + my parents are emotionally &amp; physically absent most of the time so I also had to re-parent myself. I'm really desperate for advice. Please help. I'm becoming tired of being ""strong"" alone for a long time.",college,How to accept the fact that I might not graduate on time at uni?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/v6oozn/how_to_accept_the_fact_that_i_might_not_graduate/,1654602383.0
53,SuddenlyCoding,1654284620,/r/college/comments/v47099/conflicted_between_computer_science_and_economics/,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently a freshman in community college about to end my second semester. Next year, I plan to submit my transfer applications and hopefully attend a 4-year university starting in Fall 2023. I have been super conflicted about whether I want to major in CS or Economics, and I have to register for classes next year, solidifying my major.

The advantages of CS are clear: I enjoy the material, I really like coding, and it's generally considered to be a better major on the job market. Plus, going from CS -&gt; a business related masters, such as an MBA, is much easier than going from a business related major, such as economics (yes, I know economics is not the same as a business major) to a CS masters.

Economics is a subject I find less interesting, although still intriguing. However, there are two major disadvantages to declaring a CS major over Economics:

1. Transferring to a good university will be a lot more challenging. For example, I am part of a program that gives me guaranteed admission to a UC (not binding, so I can still apply to other schools and have my guaranteed UC school as a backup). For Economics, that UC is UC Santa Barbara, and for CS, that school is UC Riverside. Still a great school, but I would much rather have guaranteed admission to UCSB. Additionally, outside of this guaranteed admission program, transfer rates are just much lower in general to CS, as there just isn't much space for more CS majors. Finally, I currently have a 4.0 GPA, but with some of these upper division CS math classes I have to take, I am not 100% sure I could maintain it. Since transferring is so GPA dependent, this makes me very nervous. I think I have a good shot at ending up at a T25 university if I stick with Econ (which I've already completed all the requirements for with A's), but with CS, this will be significantly more challenging. The only exception is UCLA, which because of another program I'm doing, I have a better chance at CS than Economics. Other than UCLA, it will be a lot harder, and I don't want to gamble on getting into UCLA.
2. While I understand I'm not going to graduate and instantly be put in a leadership position, I want to lead and manage throughout my career. I am worried that CS will position me to be a software developer for the rest of my life, whereas Economics will give me the upper hand on this ambition. I could go into management consulting, finance, or another business related field and work my way up with a clearer path than a CS major. On the flip side, CS will be more helpful for starting my own company - although, I could always teach myself programming without getting the CS major. I'm willing to work long hours for leadership opportunities and good pay, but I'm worried that while CS sets me up for a comfortable lifestyle, it isn't preferable for aggressive career growth.

I know Reddit isn't the best place to ask this, but I can't make up my mind and would really appreciate your advice. What should I study?

Thanks,

My dad pays his bill through online so he doesn't get mail at all. I asked my brother if an email of my dad getting a confirmation of him paying the bill would be okay as proof residency and he said yes.I think it wouldn't count as actual proof of residency since it need to show i've lived here for more than 12 months and the address.They have already approved my lawful presence but haven't approve of the residency and I can't edit the checklist/supplemental since it says it's already been submitted. I already sent an email if I could send another proof of residency (found an internet bill from 2021 with address listed) and if I could send a picture of my transcript online (since I have the paper copy and my high school was listed as unkown on the sight). If those doesn't work, should I go in person to get it confirmed? Or should I just send another application but bring it in person and pay another $25. I'm panicking thinking they'll just reject me just because they don't get a transcript from my high school and proof of residency. I've submitted my application on May 30th. It's only been a day or so but I just want to get this resolved since I'd like to apply for FAFSA as soon as I can.

I actually began CC back in 2018 but dropped out when the pandemic hit so Im still here, a 22 year old still in community college no where near to transfering. Another reason why I am taking so long to transfer is because IDK what career I want, Im not passionate about anything outside of Dance and Art but I know that doesnt pay the bills so I kinda just want whatever major will get me a whatever job to pay the bills. I am so indecisive that I have changed majors a couple of times, starting with psychology, to business, to communications with a dance minor atm. Tbh I am only doing communications because its more or less easy and allows me to spend more time in dance and fitness, but I still feel like most academic classes are torturous and I also can't concentrate at all on material I don't care about(Im just glad Im done with english and math, anything else should be more bereable). I also suck at remembering homework assignments and getting places in time, it may not sound so bad through reddit but seeing my academic history throughout grade school along with many other symptoms, I am starting to feel that I have ADHD(I set up an appointment with my psychiatrist for evaluation). Im really confused as to what I should do, should I drop out, change majors, stay with what I have, IDK? I only want a bachelors so that I can get any whatever job and because I feel lesser than my highschool friends graduating already, if it wasnt for those two factors I would drop out or study dance.

I'm so sad and can't concentrate that I done even take my heart pills ( arrhythmias ) and during the day while I'm sitting or standing I feel a presure in my head ,my heart starts beating very fast and my sight bloors and I geek like finding but I manage to stay still and avoid that . I've been experiencing these things for 4 months now after having to choose major in college ( in my country thr system says that according to the subjects we have access to certain studies and we have to choose it before sitting exams). So that's my story a 19 year old who said that she would be a doctor since their 15 ; however she wasn't good at physics / chemistry, / maths , but she still chose them in ordrt to keep her opportunities open.  She did got good grades at school with help of professors , but on the exams of the subjects she was not good at she always got under 10 put of 20 . She  started feeling that she won't survive and that she is stupid comparing to most of their classmates who were like fuckijf ainstsins on these subjects . Then covid hit and also a brake up with the same person that I loved since a kid and hurt me severly by ghosting me and breaking up with me all the time because of distance.  I felt ugly, problematic and not deserved to be loved at my 16 when we were on covid I was everyday in my bed crying and trying to understand what is wrong with me why I was treated like a rubbish like a girl used only to have fun With .. I focused on ..making myself looking more attractive an digested that I'm just stupid  for school . I was doing bad and felt like  there's no way no way literally I could learn these things and become good at them it felt so boring and late . After one year I was homeschooling couldn't pay attention I learned nothing I was  fed up and so bored and remained so cocially alone and my bf was making our with someone else while j was home depending on his affection and attention to feel a human... I changed subjects last year without giving it much thought  i had the need to score really high even on easy subjects to feel smart ,to feel that I'm not useless that I can do something well.  Well no 4 months ago I was asked to fill my uni entrance exams and I realised that I could only go for psychology speech pathology and teaching...  I've our them all to pass one .. instead tho I prefer to pass away...

I feel guilt I even thought of staying hone and only srudy kne year thescienced I suck at to try for medice next year although I know I want pass , I even thought if there's anyway to study abroad med without breaking having a diploma with physics and chemistry on it ... I  even thought of trying hard and I imagine my self being a doctor and dream about it .. then I wake up and reallise that I'm stuck I want tk vomit I ruined my future for some stupid guys who are going to be perfect.  I have no financial support my dad has cancer and he was the only one working  , my mum has heart problems and they are also fighting every day for if my dad wasn't sick they would have  broken up, since my dad's behavior is a torture he screams because eat what he brings home he  screams if er don't have a shower Ata fix hour he laughs and makes us feel stupid for expressing ourselves...

Anyway,my biggest concern guys is that I really feel hopeless and stuck I recognize I've made a mistake but I don't want to be defined by it I don't want to ruin my whole life I know how hard it is I was late to understand what is going on in this hotibble world we are living and I'm willing to work and achieve and Survive ... but I don't knkw what to do I want to finally take care of my needs of my brain and knowledge and i feel is so late I did not had a good doundation in high dchokl in order to be able to study something worthy... I'm stupid for dreaming a medical school although I would love it .. and stupid for wanting to go abroad and at the same time kept here for a person I love ... I'm aslo stupid for dreaming other things whike I didn't even sit exams and I want to die again ... I don't knkw what to do once I pass I don't want my parents to suffer either they already feel ashamed.  I don't knkw what to do guys I'm lost the worst thing is that I dknr have a certain goal I just know i like health related studies and have no idea of finance ..computer and etc .

57,iknowobamasfirstname,1653327962,/r/college/comments/uw5wnv/incoming_freshman_selfimprovement_checklist/,"I'm moving into my dorm in just under three months and I wanted to share my list of personal self-improvements so I can make the most of my college experience. Any suggestions or even your own lists are welcome.

- First and foremost, I need to get out of my room, dude! I don't have to be a hermit anymore to evade my family. My dorm building is full of opportunities to socialize, especially since it only houses freshmen, and I really gotta take advantage if I'm paying all that money for it. The way the building is structured is that it's a tower with a sort of hangout area in each floor; maybe I could bring my Switch, hook it up to one of the TVs, and invite others to play with me. Or study in that area... anything to not fester in my dorm room.

- Get used to being more open. I'll have a random roommate (luckily, they have a roommate matching system to pair those with common interests/habits) so most privacy is off the table anyway, but I just gotta be more interesting. I do a lot of cool things - art, animation, creative writing, all of that on top of majoring in CS - and I'm not usually expressive about these. Since I have nothing to hide anymore (overbearing family), why not show people the cool stuff I make? This also goes for things like my favorite music artists, animes, etc., many of which I wear on my clothes. I get judged every day at home for these, but once I move out, who's going to really give a damn about what I wear? I could connect with someone through these anyway.

- Be presentable. Nothing crazy, just keep my consistent hygiene habits going, brush my teeth more often, and (this is a little embarrassing to admit but) keep my hands off my face and get my nails growing healthy again after so many months of stress. I've promised myself to start these right after my high school graduation two weeks from now. Quitting is honestly harder for me than it might seem.

- Hit the gym if I can. They have a recreational building with a full gymnasium near my dorm, and if my schedule can fit it in, maybe get a good workout in occasionally. I need to gain muscle weight and not look like a walking skeleton.

- Stop procrastinating. I can't breeze through my schoolwork at the last minute anymore, especially not with a STEM major.

- Know my campus and get involved, take advantage of extra educational opportunities, and find a good work-study program. They all pay the same towards my tuition so it's just a matter of picking what sounds cool.

- Be careful with my spending habits. I can't really afford to throw money out the window as I do already.

I'd say I got fully humbled once I got to high school. I was surrounded by other honors/ap kids that literally got 100s without even trying. I found myself sinking lower and lower in grades while these kids just did what I wanted so bad so effortlessly. I think the higher level ap math courses were the last straw, never had I ever felt so stupid and useless in an academic context. 

When I got to college, I really thought I would be pursuing medicine like an idiot and very quickly realized that those ""weed out courses"" were there to weed ME out. I realized I genuinely am not one of the ""smart ones"" in the university/adult world. These people doing comp sci majors w super advanced math or biology majors + undergrad research on the side or physics majors who have it so hard failing exams in normal? Those are the smart kids holy shit. 

As someone whose strengths lie in writing and the humanities side of things, university has made me feel so shitty about my talents (which are far and few between anyways) and type of intelligence. I've kinda just settled for law as a way to at least get some kind of accepted ""good job"" (I do have a strong passion for justice and analysis though don't worry this is just what has ended up being the best fit for me imo) and I just feel so stupid compared to the people around me landing internships and jobs in AI, bioengineering, etc. 

I know I can go the business route but I genuinely just can't see my self thriving in the corporate world, I just feel a very strong need to devote my career to trying to fix the many wrongs of the world. 

To top it off, the type of law I want to go into apparently pay jack so it just kinda affirms the feeling of uselessness and not being good enough.

At my university, I could transfer this in for four credits + skip the indroductory, base-level computer science class. 

I'm so incredibly torn on whether I should do it or not. I took AP CSA online during COVID (aka didn't pay attention), and learned Java the previous year in our schools Intro Compsci class (the material was essentially the same). I looked through the project list for the intro class at my college and once a couple months roll by the projects get a lot bigger than anything I've done + start including some concepts that I've never learnt. The project list for the second-tier computer science class (what I would be in first-semester if I exchanged the credit) starts off with totally unfamiliar things to me. Note that the only thing I could find about these projects were a Github folder created ten years ago - I'd love to try to challenge myself with some of the projects in the class to see if I could actually do it, but I can't find the professor-assigned guidelines projects anywhere.

There's certainly some concepts in the intro class at college that I will have to teach myself if I skip it and I frankly don't want to do that, especially if this class serves as the foundation for my entire schooling.

63,SaadInHalf,1651442999,/r/college/comments/ugapw7/i_really_blew_it_please_help/,"This is a really long one- but please stick with me. I need some real help and I'm breaking down here trying to figure it out. I've written this much because the problem could be anywhere in here and I want the best advice I can get.

To preface, I was a high performer in high school (Class of 2020). By no means was I a particularly good student, but I was a high performer, and I've read tons and tons at this point on the issues that are associated with that/being labeled ""gifted""/etc. I never really had to apply a ton of study skills in high school therefore and never really had the chance to learn them. I was both smart and decently privileged, so anywhere that my smarts couldn't make up for the study skills, a tutor or my mom was there to catch me. I pretty much nailed high school with the exception of like one B in Senior year after COVID hit. Graduated with honors, wasn't valedictorian but that was fine, the kid who got it really deserved it.

In the summer leading up to college, I got accepted to my dream school, which was awesome, but a lot of family issues resulted from it. Toxic father who was abusive as both a parent and a spouse who insisted to pay for college for the sake of status, but also refused to pay for any school unless I landed ridiculous amounts of scholarship money... you know how it goes. Eventually we managed to get him to pay for my dream school, since I didn't get in on any scholarship and our blessed situation financially didn't really award any financial aid. I promise this becomes important later, just stick with me here.

Of course, because this was the summer of 2020, this is when COVID really changed the college scene and my school offered the option to go online, so naturally this is what I did since my whole family was really COVID-conscious. Fall semester comes around... and given how I started this, you're probably expecting me to say this is where I flopped, but truthfully, I actually NAILED first year. I even managed to develop all the work ethic and good study habits, along with having a thriving social life while at home! All As in primarily important pre-med stem classes with an extra elective I wanted to take. Only got an A- in the lab Gen Chem lab. I had the option to take Spring semester remote as well, so I did that.

At this point, a huge family crisis hit where we finally just hit the peak of the bs my father was putting my mother, sister, and I through, and he filed for a divorce behind my mom's back after she suggested they could file together. This became an incredibly stressful situation on top of being ostracized from an online friend group I'd been in for a year and a breakup with my girlfriend of three year at the time. My coping mechanisms weren't the greatest, but I trudged through the semester and did alright. Somewhat lighter course load, in all fairness, but all As and A-s, with one B+ from Gen Chem (which would have been an A if I didn't botch the final), so that's still incredible performance. In all fairness, I also made a lot of excuses in my lighter, less-serious classes that allowed me extensions on certain assignments and such, but that's still incredible performance and I'm not afraid to flaunt that. Ended freshman year on a 3.8/9 (depending on how you round it) GPA. However, due to the panic at the time, my mom really was panicked about that B+ in Gen Chem, so we decided it would be a good idea to get Organic out of the way ASAP, so I took it during the summer.

That was hell, but I came out with a B-, but my mom and I, being so used to how I was performing in high school, felt it wouldn't be a bad idea to just take it again during the school year since I've already seen the material once now and can just nail it next time, while also taking Bio and some other lighter classes (that would fit my now major, Psychology). It also was a huge hit to my confidence and momentum, alongside what I perceived to now be another huge pressure I needed to compensate for when I got to school in the Fall.

**Here's the juicy part. Sophomore year**

The divorce situation between my parents boiled on for the entirety of that winter semester, through the summer and fall semester, and finally ended during the Spring break of this past Spring 2022 semester. It only became worse and worse, and with my moving out, I wasn't able to handle it well at all, especially since on the big move-out day (remember I was remote that entire first year), my father trounced all over it by calling in his moving crew to move out to his apartment the same day.

My coping mechanisms with the whole ordeal were awful, and I had also recently rekindled my relationship with the girl who broke up with me during Spring 2021 (we found out a lot of our issues were based on gaslit misunderstandings from some 'friends' we had who hated what we had going on... we're healthier and happier than ever with each other now). So I was spending a lot of time with her over the phone trying to cope. At first, things still felt exciting and fresh and new. I renovated my room from the worst building on campus into something *AMAZING* (not to brag). My first couple weeks I was studying hard and good, but it all just started to catch up with me.

My work ethic just vanished. All that change I'd made and resilience I had to the family situation and other problems in freshman year just vanished. I was breaking down, I was skipping classes (which I had never done even *once* up until this point), and was doing so pretty unapologetically. I was suddenly having intense trouble grasping material well enough to do anything on exams, even when I felt just as confident as I would in freshman year before exams that I *aced*. I tried talking to on-campus counselors and therapists and they were nice but it just wasn't helping. I took courses from the Student Wellness Center to see what I might be missing, but I just couldn't do it.

I knew and know what I have to do but I just can't do it. I know I need to put in the work, but I've stopped studying diligently and regularly too. That whole first semester I didn't really even have close friends on campus aside from my roommate, because I became a shut-in, but in the last two weeks of Fall 2021 I managed to find some really nice people who I'm now close friends with. I even start making the walk to classes, then just sitting outside the classroom or building. It's right there. It's just another 50 footsteps away, but I don't go in. My confidence kept taking more and more hits as I'd mess up even incredibly easy classes. Fall 2021 ended with one A in a basically gimme-A class, a B-, and all Cs.

It's only during Spring 2022 when I managed to fix my issues of attendance and start actually getting up in the mornings consistently and going to classes and not just staying outside, and even now, my grades are technically doing even worse. I ended up with a midterm deficiency for my absences in one of my classes. I used standing witness in my parents' trial to skip out on some midterms whose credit have been shifted onto my upcoming finals. I don't want to be a bad student or a bad person but I really just feel like I somehow randomly am now. I really want to do well. I just can't find the drive, focus, or motivation to do any of what I need to do now. My semester is yet again looking like it's going to finish out on Bs and Cs, which, while not the worst thing ever, is certainly not gonna cut it for med schools.

I've made it this far, and even got myself together during my freshman year of college. I managed to overcome that typical gifted-kid burnout slump or whatever it is. I overcame my lack of study skills, time, management, and social awkwardness I had in high school. Then I move out to college after doing the first year remote with a few unnecessary hits to my self-confidence over things that really weren't big problems in hindsight, a bunch of extra problems on my back, and no ways to properly cope that are genuinely helping me.

*The interesting part of the issue here is not the same thing about high-performing high school students doing bad in college*. *It's about actually getting myself together after high school, nailing freshman year and not even feeling too burnt out, making one mistake (that I blew way out of proportion) at a bad time when everything else in my life comes crashing down, and now it's all gone.*

I keep feeling remotivated to try and try again but then two days after I get that motivation burst I just fall back into it all. I'm so tired and don't know what to do. I can't find anything on even remotely similar situations, but there has to be someone out there, right? Please. Someone help me. I'm so tired and scared. I'm not gonna make any huge life-altering or ending decisions so please don't worry about that. But just, please. Someone help me. I don't know what to do.

I absolutely adore learning about diseases and immunology. I was set on becoming a doctor ever since I was a kid and it was in high school when I decided I wanted to become an immunologist. I was a part of so many medical/healthcare related clubs in high school and was always the top of the class when it came to physiology and bio. I was also the top student in my high school's medical program. I just loved health and medicine.

However, when I entered college, I began attending seminars where people who had worked in the medical field would come and talk to students. I began to realize that I can't afford to do ~10 more years of schooling/ training and I certainly cannot afford to carry on the amount of debt that will accrue while in med school. I'm a first gen student from an immigrant, low-income family. My parents are getting old and I need to take care of them soon. They're expecting me to get a well-paying job straight out of undergrad which is incredibly unrealistic unless I was a CS major, which I am not. I'm pursuing a degree in Molecular and Cell Biology with a concentration in either biochem, genetics, neurobiology, or immunology. I was initially leaning towards immunology, but apparently it's not a very lucrative area? 

I don't even care about what I like anymore because I feel like what I like (immunology, studying infectious diseases, etc.) doesn't appear to pay very well, at least straight out of undergrad. My concern rn is how high my income will be but with a bio degree and the oversaturation of the bio field, my chances of getting a well-paying job seem low. Everyone is telling me to pursue my passion but I'm starting to hate it because my mind is just automatically filled with shame and guilt because my intended field is not lucrative enough.

Idk what I should do now. I'm going to be a junior next semester. I can't realistically switch to compsci or data science because the courses are just notoriously difficult at my university and I'll need to take summer classes if I want to complete a CS or DS degree on time which I cannot afford even with financial aid and most of the courses my university requires do not have a CC equivalent since my university expects a certain level of rigor.

I'm trying to think of a plan now. I'm definitely going to drop premed. I'm thinking of doing a bunch of data science or compsci certification programs and maybe combining those with my bio degree (idk which concentration I should do) will land me a good job in the biotech field or pharmtech field? Should I choose the genetics concentration for my bio major? Or, something that might be slightly better would be to switch my med school goals to PA school instead and become a physician assistant. It's less years but idrk a lot about the process. 

Idk I'm just really stressed out about my future and living up to my parents' expectations. I haven't been able to pull myself out of bed recently and just feel super despondent about everything. I don't wanna talk to any of my friends. I don't want to talk to my partner. I don't want to talk to my parents.

**Full text:**

I'm taking my final exams at the end of this year, and I'm currently looking into different universities and colleges. I've had a shaky relationship with my interest in art lately but I know I want to do something creative with my life. For simplicity's sake: AR degree = art-related degree.

I'm not sure if I should:

1. study in an arts school
2. study in a university where I can major in an AR degree
3. study in a university where I can major in an AR degree AND a more ""in-demand""/useful degree
4. take a gap year

The problem is, I can't seem to find an AR degree that does it for me. I currently study Visual Arts in my school, and it's made me realise that fine arts isn't for me. The notion that studying art won't pay well is very common, so I've had my doubts about studying it (especially since my parents are often stressed about our finances). I've been looking into digital media degrees and I think it's something I want to do though I don't have a lot of experience. However, I saw one university's showcase and the projects were quite disappointing.

As for a more ""in-demand"" degree, my parents have suggested comp sci. While it looks interesting, I've heard how difficult it can be and I have no experience. I think I'll take some online courses to get a feel of it first.

A gap year is possible, but I feel a lot of social pressure to not do it since everyone is moving on to university and out of my home country. Even if I stayed, my country is quite pragmatic and doesn't have a genuine landscape for art.

I've worked hard on my academics in highschool but I feel like I've neglected to look at the bigger picture and try different classes. Uni applications start in a few months, and I'm not sure what I want to do and how to figure this out. I think my best course of action is to rack up skills and classes and try new things, but realistically it will be difficult to juggle my academics and other classes.

I want to go to med school but we're not that well off, so I'm thinking that maybe i have to take a year or two to work before med school. However, the job doesn't pay much for medtechs and here is where the dilemma comes in. 

If i take nursing, it's like a jack of all trades program as it studies the wideness of medicine but unlike medtech, it isn't as focused on labs. It also pays better than medtech if i choose to take a gap year to work before enrolling to med school.

It's really confusing for me and i can't decide. Enrollment is just less than a month away. Send help.",college,What college program should i take?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/u771xb/what_college_program_should_i_take/,1650398092.0

But here's the context: I got recently into a small public school, which is fantastic since it's close to my relatives and it has good research opportunities. I also got rejected everywhere so it's my only option. 

The thing is, even though I got their highest scholarship and got into their honors program, it's not enough. My scholarship is 36k, which is 9k por year. I'm an international student, so my tuition is around 30k or a bit more per year. My parents are extremely supportive, and they want to pay this year. But I can't keep asking my parents for help during 4 years since that's a lot of money. I know that working part time won't help too much since I have to pay for my living expenses and other fees even if I live with my relatives. 

I want to ask my school for more money, but I'm scared to get a negative response. I have not committed yet, because I don't know the hell I'm going to do. No one recommended me to take private student loans. 

I have applied to another scholarship (same school) which is for international students. But they have not replied back, so I guess I didn't got anything. The scholarship it's not very popular, it's called ""YouAreWelcomeHere"" so I didn't find any info about when their decisions are released or something.

What should i do? My parents keep telling me that I should go for it and then see if I can apply to other scholarships as a freshman. But I know that there's a bit chance. I'm scared. I worked really hard since i can't study in my own country. Not sure if it matters, but I'm also a first Gen.

so i struggled a lot emotionally in high school, but i always managed to figure it out. i was hospitalized a lot due to my mental illness (i had a rough childhood and suffer from PTSD) and i ended up leaving my public high school to go to a special education school that really helped me succeed. i graduated a semester late because of medical leave and took a gap semester while i planned what to do next.

i never struggled academically in high school, though, even at my public school. i was always a straight A honors student and achieved a lot. it wasn't difficult for me to get into good colleges. i ended up choosing a school and i got a 4.0 GPA my first semester, but at the end of the semester i had a really serious suicide attempt and ended up having to get trauma treatment for some suppressed memories of sexual abuse. 

i transferred to a school across the country and that was probably a big mistake. it has been SO isolating. i have like no friends and live all by myself. i switched my major, too, but i think i do like studying psychology. i just can't take care of myself here and im very alone. to cope with all this stress and pain i've turned to a lot of substances and slowly started to give up on myself. i recently admitted to myself that the drinking and smoking is a major problem and i need to be sober. at this point, i've completed 64 credits with a good/decent GPA, but i am failing this semester. i spoke with the registrar at my school and am trying to withdraw, but i will need to try to get WPs (withdraw/passes) from my professors so that this won't affect my GPA. this is not going to be easy given that i have been avoiding everything up until now.

i struggle a lot financially and have been working a lot, which has been overwhelming. i do love the job i currently have though, i just got my certificate as a Registered Behavioral Technician. i truly did stop trying with school though. i feel like such an idiot and shell of myself for letting it all get this bad. i've just been so alone and cooped up and anxious to face anything. there's always an excuse i come up with in my head. my parents are rightfully furious about all of this and have been threatening to completely cut me off, which i understand. i am thinking i should try my best to withdraw and take a year to work full time and live with a friend of mine closer to home. i'm scared that i'll end up broke and then have no way of getting help to pay for college if i feel ready to go back. i just clearly am so incapable of it right now and i don't know why. it feels like i messed my whole life up. im 22 years old and already feel like everything's over for me. i just see myself winding up on the streets. 

i don't have any real academic 'passions'. i think as a kid i never saw myself living this long so i didn't really think much about it. i did just land a well-paying job acting in a film this summer and i'm working with a really successful music producer on an EP but the last thing i want to do is end up a deadbeat and broke artist with no degree. i also feel like that would be disrespectful towards my parents who want this education for me. i really never meant for it to get this bad, and the worst part is i can only blame myself.

Honestly, I have no idea what I want to do but I knew sociology was something that struck my interest, at least a little bit. Beforehand I had attended a community college for UI/Graphic Design before realizing that online was not for me, or so I thought that was the reason that I was also failing at that institution. Little did I get that it was because of my failures and procrastinations when doing things like school. Since 11th grade, the start of Covid-19 era, I have started to avoid classes and not turn in work (partly due to a system I could abuse in my old high school of turning in work and redoing tests as much as I had wanted to). I thought attending a school in person would change my path as I had also done the same online shenanigans in my community college but I was greatly mistaken. I guess the reason I'm writing this is to help get me on the right track again. I know this is a bump in the road but I just want it to be smooth sailing from here. From this point on, I have to pay for my own college (as my parents were gracious enough to pay for it the first two times with a sum of about 20,000$ combined for both schools down the drain), and I have to somehow find this motivation I have been lacking for the past three years. I know I can't be alone as many people procrastinate in life but to the extent of messing up three times? I doubt it. I want to change and I know the first steps to changing is wanting that change, but I just need some reassurance and help on getting things together. I also hope this can be used as a tool for people who are going through the same situation as me to get their life on track and not mess up as badly as I have, maybe even heed the advice that some people might respond with.

**THE MOVE**
So we all live in Georgia, not too great here, none of my parents can get jobs (that'll pay good), and ended up hating GA. From a few interviews my dad made, he landed a job in NJ, and that's where my family will move at the end of the school year (May 26th).

**IF I STAYED**
I have literally nothing to look forward to in Georgia, all the colleges I wanted to get accepted to; rejected. 
So all I really have for college as of now are 2 state universities (none that I really care for). Also my parents are dead set on moving, say I did stay I'd be alone across the country living 4 years by myself (mind you no job, no savings, and I'd definitely be unhappy). The only thing I can really miss in Georgia would be my SO, it sucks having to move, and we've had this conversation time and time again only to reach a poimt where we realize there can still be a relationship b/w us even if we're far away (sorry for the relationship arc, I know this isn't the right place). But I'd like more for my future than living it out in GA.
(no disrespect to the place, I personally don't like it, others may !!) 

**IF I MOVED**
Moving will practically force me to take a gap year (atleast I think so). I can't apply spring semester since I have to be a resident of a state for atleast 1 year (not to pay OOS tuition; yet I'm still in the dark on this if anyone would clear it up id appreciate it!). If I did take a gap year, I'd prefer to start Fall 2023. 

**WHAT'D I DO DURING THE GAP YEAR** (important)
My first priority is to raise my test scores (ACT), I believe in a year going from a 24 to min 30 is possible and I'm much more prepared due to being in a ""school work"" mindset compared to before where I'll take it during my online classes. I'm much more focused and determined to score big on the ACT so I can become a really strong applicant. My second priority is taking some time to really get my mind straight on ""hey I'm going to college for the next 4 years to BETTER myself and PURSUE this dream of becoming an engineer that'd work on revolutionary projects... far-fetched I know)."" I NEED TIME, and a couple of months won't do me any good. It'd also be nice to get a job, make some money, get experience, just find more about the place I'll live in.. So this gap year is something I better use wisely and take meaningful breaks while honing in on my future. Once applications come around I'll have much more time to write an impactful essay and deliver a strong application.


It sounds selfish, but I want to dream BIG, all that effort I put into high school is not something I'd want to waste.

77,willy_glove,1648860810,/r/college/comments/tu6dz2/im_so_tired_of_being_a_fucking_failure/,"I had a rough start to this semester and a rough middle of the semester too. I didn't pay attention in class, skated by, and now I'm failing 2/4 of my classes, both of which are difficult core classes (computer science major). I have a 60 in one and a 62 in the other. I just want to scream and cry and beat myself up because I'm trying so fucking hard to understand the material and just when I think I'm doing okay... I fail, fail, fail, fail every assignment given to me. I think I'm genuinely stupid.

Somewhere along the line I started thinking I was special, that I was smart. In high school i put the bare minimum effort in and graduated with a 3.7. I thought other kids were stupid for failing, that school was easy as long as you showed up and payed attention. Now I'm a second-year in college, slaving away day and night, running on 5 hours of sleep (max), and I'm still failing miserably. I now have only one month left until the end of the semester and I feel absolutely hopeless. I try so hard to cry but the tears just won't come. 

All of this material seems so easy to everyone else, and I'm stuck here feeling like the lowest of the low. I think I'm actually subhuman because I don't know how I can be so confident that I'm improving only to get proven wrong again, and again, and again.

I know that I have 4 weeks left, and I've seriously been trying so fucking hard. I go to office hours every chance I get, do all the textbook readings, do all the homework, and I've been managing my time a lot better than I used to, though some things still slip through the cracks due to the insane workload I have.

What's worse is that I feel like I'm a failure not only to myself, but to my parents as well. Growing up I never really cared that much about pleasing my parents, I mostly lived by my own standards and held myself up to them and I did well enough. But now, I have a scholarship that I just might lose due to my GPA dropping too low, even if I pass all my classes by some fucking miracle. 

I was such a burden to my parents growing up (they deny it but I'm autistic and had a lot of mental health issues. I know it took a toll on them, despite how much they try to hide it from me). Now, I want nothing more than to make it up to them by showing I can take care of myself. I already took last spring semester from home because my mental health was so bad going into college thanks to losing everything in high school (due to covid) and not having any friends (also due to covid, though I also blame myself for that). I just want them to not have to worry about me, which is why I haven't told them. They're paying only 2/3 of what they'd normally pay for my tuition, and I want to make their money worth it by not having them worry about me. My younger sister has her own issues and they're dealing with that, and I'd feel awful dumping my problems onto them too. Even if I pass, I still might lose my scholarship and make them pay more money. They aren't hurting financially, but I'd still feel like an absolute failure if I lost my scholarship that I earned from good grades just because I was lazy and stupid for the first 2 months of the semester.

I'm at the end of my rope. I try and try and start to feel good about the progress I'm making, only to be utterly crushed. I go to office hours, get help, try again thinking I'm doing better this time, and it doesn't even fucking matter. I'm not good enough. I loathe myself for even thinking I'm anything above mentally retarded. I just want to lay in bed and cry and cry and cry until I pass out, but no matter what I try I just can't get that release. I'm tearing up typing this but I still can't cry.

So man things are wrong with me and I feel like I'm losing everything. Sure, in theory, I could bring up a 60 and a 62 in the next month. But at the rate I'm going, and with how stupid I am, there's no way.

78,ThatBroadcasterGuy,1648856538,/r/college/comments/tu4ziw/ive_been_thinking_about_going_to_college_but/,"I've never been to college at all, out of high school (graduated in 2013) or otherwise. The primary reason is because I didn't buy in to the hype about college. In my mind, I thought of colleges as money-grubbing organizations that prey upon naive young adults. My view on that has softened since then, however. I'm also somewhat of a nonconformist whenever it's practical to do so.

So instead of going to college, to a broadcasting school whose program lasted only one year. That was certainly better than spending four years cooped up in lecture halls and being buried in books and racking up mountain ranges of debt, right? I graduated from that program in April 2015, and started looking for jobs in the broadcasting industry. Radio or TV, it didn't matter. I should mention that I've never had a paying job before in my life. I was hoping that by going into broadcasting I could avoid a minimum wage job and jump right in to a career.

Fast forward to 2018, and I couldn't find one single position in the broadcasting field that didn't require experience. Needless to say, I felt defeated and gave up on broadcasting entirely, coming to the conclusion that broadcasting was just a passing interest and something I didn't want to seriously pursue.

I have since switched my interests to the IT field. Seeing the happy and successful lives of the people I went to high school with who went to college has caused me to reconsider my decision not to go to college.

Now, here's where the ""but..."" in the title comes into play. College (here in the US) is expensive, as you all are probably aware. Like really, really expensive. If I'm going to spend that much money on getting a piece of paper, it'd better be worth my while. I don't want the same thing to happen where after graduating (in four years!) I can't find a job in my chosen field and have to start all over again, with even more debt than I did going in. I already have student loans to pay off from the broadcasting school. I simply cannot afford to take on even more unnecessary debt. Maybe IT turns out to be yet another passing interest. Then what happens after that? Change careers and go back to college for four MORE years and rack up even MORE debt? No, that would be ludicrous. Four years is a very, very long time to spend learning. In that time I could be doing things that are much more productive than sitting in class. Am I focusing to much on the cost? Maybe. But I think that completely ignoring it isn't helpful.

And it's not like any competent college would accept me anyway. It's been less than a decade and my HS transcripts, ACT scores etc. are probably in a landfill somewhere by now. In addition, I'm 28 and by the time of graduation (if I started now) I'd be 32. That's just way too old and the admissions people would kick me out of the building the first chance they get. I'll admit that that's probably an irrational fear, but you get the idea.

I'm autistic. Mildly so, but still autistic. I did have some interest in going to college after high school, but my parents said they would move there and physically visit me every day. That's something I just couldn't abide. Isn't one of the aspects of college life learning to live away from home? Least in my view it is. I believe I could live away from home if given the chance, which I haven't gotten all my life.That's another factor which influenced my decision not to go to college.

I could go on but I think it's time to conclude this post. Am I totally missing the point? Are there ways to get higher education without incurring mountain ranges of debt? Are there ways to ensure that I have the best shot possible of landing a career? Is college less boring and mind-numbing than I think it is? Am I overthinking all of this?

**CONTEXT:**

I realized that I made a pretty horrible mistake by deciding to take on 20k in debt my first year of college when my family is very poor. We've become even more poor because my dad lost his job. As such, my parents can't pay for my college at all anymore. I haven't even put a single dent in my college tuition (literally $0) and haven't taken out any loans. I know, please don't tell me that I'm really dumb, I already know.

I also want to move out because my family is really abusive. Just assume that what they did to me was horrible enough to make me never want to talk to them again.

**CONSIDERING:**

I'm thinking about leaving college for a year to work full time at my job (pays min. wage + tips), possibly even doing a 60 hour work week. I want to live as frugally as possible to put a dent in my debt and then apply for community college after that one year. I know that I can live like this because we already live pretty frugally, and being free of my parents' insanity will allow me to be happy, even if it means I have to work super super hard.

After that, I'm thinking about doing two years of community college (still working full time).

My roommate (19F) has very quickly gotten close with her professor (45-55F) and my therapist told me the behaviors that they engage in and the things they do outside of school could be reportable to the school, including the fact that this is a current professor that my roommate is earning a grade from.

This isn't the typical, student and professor, relationship - as far as I know there is no sexual piece to it and my roommate is a legal adult. My roommate attends the local technical college and has a psychology professor for the last two semesters. My roommate has shown up to the professor's class drunk before and doesn't have the best conduct on campus and off-campus (she got a DUI a few months ago). Her professor and her have suddenly become very close, my roommate goes to her other classes that she isn't in and spends all day with her at the school. I was glad my roommate has found someone that can act as a mentor as she had kind of lost her way since the beginning of freshman year in 2020. 

This past weekend, my roommate snapchats me a picture of her in a bigger city (where I'm from actually) and I asked her who she was with/how she got there because she currently doesn't have a license. She told me that her and her professor drove together to stay in a hotel for a night and go to the LGBTQ+ nightclub for a theme night. They were staying in the same room and my roommate didn't pay for anything. 

I returned from spring break this past Monday and my roommate told me that she was leaving Tuesday (yesterday) to spend the week at her professor's house an hour away to take care of her after she got a surgery done yesterday. My roommate is skipping her other classes and work to spend this week with her professor taking care of her despite her professor having kids who live with her at home too. 

I told my therapist all of this and she said it's borderline reportable. I don't know what to do because I do fear for the safety of my roommate but I can't really directly talk to her about it as she doesn't see any issue and her professor might tell her I'm just a hater and I don't understand.

According to Washington Post: 

""The share of jobs requiring postsecondary education went from just under one-third in 1983 to nearly two-thirds in 2021, and is projected to increase to 72 percent by 2031, Carnevale said. And in 1980-1981, fewer than a million bachelor’s degrees were awarded, but that number had more than doubled by 2018-2019.""

I've spent a lot of time working before I've come back to school. I've worked in some abysmal jobs, nurses' aide, construction, and lots and lots of retail. I went to community college for two years and felt like the environment was completely fair. Questions were answered, tests were graded fairly and I felt like there was no adversarial relationship between me and my professors. 

Fast-forward to now, and I have two friends that have transferred to the state flagship university I have, and two of them have dropped. One had a child under 4 and the transfer advisor kept telling her, that the university was ""very accommodating to parents"". Nearly all of her professors had mandatory attendance policies and she couldn't arrange for childcare, nor could she really afford it. The environment totally shunned her when she reached out for help, and she could tolerate 3 months of e-mail chains and runarounds before she attended a smaller, liberal arts school that required a move and a full year off from school. My other friend had his father die due to COVID, and when he e-mailed his professors, they told him that his assignments were due at the same time regardless of his circumstances. He had to go over the prof's head, and fight to retake some assignments, and eventually felt so cheated and disrespected by the whole ordeal that he went to a trade school. And I honestly don't blame him. 

I see this from mostly the US, and in this case, you do realize we are the only country where we have to pay to go to school, and we are giving you money that we basically don't have? You can assume that all of your students are 18-24 with ample parental support and collectively shrug at why 70% of nontrads are dropping out. And it's not just us, but students with physical and psychological disabilities have to jump through backlogged hoops of fire for just a nod of agreement with certain accommodation offices. Students who commute and have to sit through 40 minutes of traffic on DC/NY/CA corridors don't have it the same (especially when it comes to gas costs now) as students who roll out of their dorms and walk 10 mins to class in the morning. 

I'm not at all shitting on the traditional students. After all, during the pandemic, over half of students in this meta-analysis reported basically meeting PHQ-9 scores for clinical depression and 2/3rds met the threshold for anxiety.

And to be real? Despite the American workforce being as bastardly as it is, most Americans don't have the same mental health stats as our students do. 

I've been working longer than some have been professors here (I'm 40+) and I want to say, YOU may feel YOU are in the right from getting your rocks off by taking advantage of teenagers that don't know any better, but you're not. No matter how much you like to show up on reddit and brag about YOUR failing grades and call us Karens for needing time off for bereavement. I can't believe that this is where we're ""at"" with academia, and I wish we (students) could have more of a conversation around this. I wish more arrangements could be made around dangerous and power-tripping professors, other than refusal to enroll. 

I know ""The Great Resignation"" is taking place, but, I have seriously been treated better at nearly all of my jobs by even the shittiest bosses than I have by some of my professors, and the overall fast-paced, sink-or-swim, take-delight-half-the-class-failing attitudes I have seen from professionals is NOT a good thing OR a reason to brag.

82,honda_gingerbread,1647966329,/r/college/comments/tk6tei/should_i_get_a_second_bsc_in_nursing_after/,"Hi, citizens of Quora. I'm in a little dilemma over what the future holds for me. I am currently in my final year of studying electronic and electrical engineering. My reason for choosing this field of study was because of my love for mathematics, physics, and analytical thinking, back in secondary school. I'm performing well in college because I have been acquiring above-average-grades. I like engineering.

But there's a big problem. I am from a third-world country. The engineering profession is in a big mess. There is no well-paying job for the average engineering graduate. There is no silicon valley, no massive employment opportunity in the power sector, no big chance in the telecommunications sector either.

 Even if you manage to get a job as a graduate trainee, the highest amount you will get is the equivalent of US$100 to US$150 per month. The cash is not enough to rent a good one-room apartment. Also, during one of my internships, I discovered the poor working conditions for engineers in the industrial areas. Many of them don't have the required PPE to shield them from danger. The junior engineers keep complaining about everything. Furthermore, one of my professors in college warned my entire class that professional engineers are treated like shit, not only in my country, but in some other parts of the globe. He told us to go for a Masters.... and pursue an MBA. Perhaps, maybe an MBA will give an engineer a place among the board of directors (I can't say) He said engineers have little or no financial voice on industrial operations (which results in low pay). 

 In fact, to cap it up, every single sector in my country is a big ball of mess that can't be quenched anytime soon (healthcare, tourism, politics, technology, financial sector e.t.c you name it). Bear in mind, I still love engineering. But these conditions are really discouraging. However, another area that interests me at the moment is machine learning and artificial intelligence. I code decently well too. Computer science catches my interest.

Consequently, my nuclear family have been persuading me to get a second degree in nursing. With a nursing degree, they claimed that there is a chance that I could get a well paying job in America, Canada, Australia, or a first-world country. I figured that they are right. The requirement is to apply to a nursing agency or council, write a standardized English test, and pass the necessary exams. Also, the richest members of my extended family are nurses in the US and the UK. The pressure from my immediate family has been really intense. They claim that I have the mental capability and brilliance to pull through a nursing degree. They claim that I have always been an exceptional Student.

I can actually give it a try and get into nursing school. But, there's a problem. I am not sure that I'll  like the career. I don't think I like bodily fluids, poop, or blood. I'm not a people person. After giving myself a thorough assessment, I don't think I have what it takes to excel as a professional nurse. But I still can't say, because I've never worked in an hospital before.

I want to go in the tech direction. But I'm not sure things might work out. Should I give the nursing degree a try? It's gonna be another five years of schooling.",college,Should I get a second BSc in nursing after completing my engineering degree,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tk6tei/should_i_get_a_second_bsc_in_nursing_after/,1647984329.0

Well, I did, at first. Then personal issues got in the way and my mental health spiraled worse than ever before (which is saying a lot), plus I moved to 3 different cities in the first month (involuntarily) which cost about $10k so I needed to work full-time to pay and also I had a seizure and went psychotic for a while shortly after so yea school wasn't a priority at all anymore and I sort of got used to getting shitty marks because of incomplete work and it's become like learned helplessness. I barely try anymore bc it seems like no matter what I never finish and either way I'm frustrated so why bother. Which is funny considering I'd be pissed with anything less than 100 in my first degree, which was biomedical science btw and this one is software engineering. It doesn't help that everyone says to just get a 3.0GPA and you're fine for employment. While in premed it's like if you get one mark under 99 just drop out.

Anyways yea like I want to care but I'm so sleep deprived and honestly just fucked up in the head lately. Look at my post history. I've spent the ENTIRE month of fucking March adjusting my monitors. Literally not a drop of schoolwork. I finally got my shit together 2 days ago but like I got shit due! Literally tomorrow an assignment and I'm about 1.5 months behind in the course, I don't even know what the questions are asking. Every mark in this course has been a 60 so far and I'm just like, wtf who are you.

Everyone in my life that hasn't given up on me is like  ""....what the fuck?"" except they don't even know what's actually going on.  Neither do I tbh. I've formed maybe 1? or 2 memories in 2021 and man Idk. Shits scary. 

My first degree was like 1 month of online school and I failed literally everything lol, thankfully it wasn't worth much. I have ADHD so I'm thinking it might just be the online part of it. I'd go in person except it's 500km away and also I'd rather drop out and die than go live their again bc it was traumatizing. So now I'm like what the fuckkkkk. I applied to transfer to the University that's approximately 400m from where I'm living right now but I doubt I'll get in with a failed course even though I have all 90s in everything else. 

Idk, I really do want to go into this industry but fuck these courses are dry as hell. So fucking boring. I've actually been in the workforce but went back to school to get properly qualified and like idk. I enjoyed my job but overall I hate working and at this point, for the first time in my life, I hate school, so now what. Do I just slowly decay. Why couldn't I have been a nepotism baby.

84,holdermanju,1647540032,/r/college/comments/tgg5yc/so_i_found_out_this_year_that_the_college_i_go_to/,"So I go to Central Carolina technical college and I take online classes. But this isn't the only college that is like this when I went to Sinclair community college They did the same thing and I pretty much got the same exact amount of money. I am an independent student because I am 29 years old and once you get to a certain age you become independent so the maximum ones I can get per year as a freshman is 9,500. Or something like that. And then next year it goes up to $10,500 and then I think the last two years it's $12,500 or something like that?

Anyway the amount is not the point. The point is that I cannot get them to give me the full loan amount. Or to give me even close to the full loan amount. Now I checked the amount that they let me borrow this year and it comes out to $4,900. When I'm allowed to borrow up to $9,500... Now I do not need the entire $9,500 but I do need more than they're giving me. At least for this semester. Because of my living expenses I need more for this semester at the very least... And I don't understand why the school gets to decide how much money I'm allowed to borrow.

Do any of you know of any online schools that are not crazy expensive that would be willing to let me borrow more on my student loans? Do you know if any online schools or just community colleges that will allow me to take online classes no matter what state they're in that are more relaxed on letting you borrow larger amounts? 


Because it even states on the website on the same page where it shows my financial award and it says that attending the college I go to plus all the extra stuff to get to pay for including housing costs about $15,000 per year yet the award that they've given me with loans and financially does not come close to $15,000... In fact they have a deficit of $3,600... They expect it to cost you $14,995 and then with my financial aid award and the loans that they allowed me to borrow I haven't total $11,395... Now explain to me how it is that they know that it costs $14,995 to attend their school and pay for a living situation and books and classes and everything else yet they will only let me borrow + financial aid $11,395.... I mean if they even gave me just a little bit more to get closer to that $14,995 mark My life would be so much easier. I wouldn't have to work so much while I go to school and I could just focus on taking my classes instead of working my ass off full time or above full time while I go to school... I mean renting a one bedroom apartment in the area I'm in is $900 to $1,200 a month. I cannot afford to work as much as I am and go to school. It is insane that they're not at least letting me get the amount that they are saying that it cost to attend their school...


So if anyone knows of any two-year colleges or technical colleges either online or physical schools that I can still take online classes for because it doesn't matter what state they're in as long as I can do online classes I can set everything up from where I'm at. I mean I took classes from a college in Ohio that I used to attend and I live very far from Ohio. Never once went to the school to set anything up. But if anybody knows of any schools that are more relaxed on letting you borrow more money from your loans even if it's not the maximum amount just that they let you borrow the money you need... Please let me know and I will look into the college and see if they have the degree I'm interested in and think about going to them. Maybe at least we're a semester or two and then I'll transfer my credits. I just can't seem to get on my feet with the fact that this college will not let me borrow more money... I don't understand how they can say that it cost $15,000 a year to go to their college and then short me $3,600...",college,"So I found out this year that the college I go to will not give me the maximum amount of loans that I'm allowed. which is $9,500 per year because I am an independent student.

85,okayshark,1647359489,/r/college/comments/tes33g/physics_biology_dilemma_on_whether_i_should/,"TLDR is at the bottom as well as my questions. This turned out very long, I apologize.

To start out i would like to say this: I love physics, ever since i was in elementary school i've loved physics phenomena, lasers, optics and had marvelled at the fact that we can explain so much about the universe. I took physics as one of my Leistungskurse (elevated courses with more hours in German high schools), did my hs graduation exam in it and finished with an excellent score. I really did enjoy it all the way and our teacher was super chill and supportive, in general all my physics teachers were very cool and made our lessons fun with many very interesting experiments. It's a language that we can explore the universe in and that makes it very exciting.

So it's no wonder i went into university pretty determined on physics, however i didn't make my decision based on one specific job i wanted to do, but coming from a thirst for knowledge.

In high school, my strategy was to pay attention in lessons and thoroughly write everything down and take notes. I wasn't the kid that caught up to everything the teacher said in the lesson and when preparing for exams or revising I would sit and go through everything by myself. This was a very good method for me personally because i could understand the concepts and their connections in my own pace and understand things through my own methods. It might sound weird that the kid who was regarded as one of the top students sometimes couldn't have answered the most simple questions on a new topic, but that's how it was, i just needed the time.

But ever since the bridge courses before the semester i've been struggling. I'm told that it's normal for first years to feel like everyone around you knows everything and only you are behind, but after a semester the feeling is still strongly there. I will admit I have made many mistakes, like starting the more in-depth math courses from the beginning and not revising after every other class. As the workload was immense, I barely slept in the first two months. This in turn lead to me barely being able to stay awake in class and tutorials. I acknowledge these mistakes and have already made adjustments to lighten the load.

Now, as for uni, the sheer amount of stuff we have to learn, on our own, at my university -which might be a normal amount, given this is university- is a lot to approach with my method. We were advised to study in groups and do our weekly exercise sheets together, and though I had some moments of victory where I could do one exercise, mostly it consisted of the other students talking about the topic like they understood it really well while I sat there and listened for any coherent crumbs of info and sometimes asked for a tip on how to proceed. Admittedly this was not a good method and I found some people closer to my pace who I could study with, but they weren't always there or we ended up sitting with our sheets well into dusk. So by the time I got home I was tired and turned to my phone for an escape lot of the time. Now I know that delaying catching up with our topics is a bad strategy due to time and the amount of material. But it seems like it's good if i take the time to catch up and revise by myself, also because the way things are explained in class don't always work for me.

As for the social aspect of it, there wasn't really a time where I felt that I fit in or that I have much in common with anyone there except maybe when we were talking about art. I also found myself rethinking my choices a lot. I missed my friends and my family immensely and honestly struggled to feel human at times. I haven't really been able to find the motivation to study beyond the desire to get through another week.

When I look into what kind of scripts belong to classes in later semesters, the topics seem interesting, still it's pages of text with about the same amount of equations which i'm sure contain so much interesting and informative stuff.. Still right now that aspect of ""woah that's so cool"" is kind of missing. Maybe that will come later, i figure when we get to more stuff that's beyond mechanics.

I suspect I might also have ADHD and may be nd in other ways which i will get checked out with a professional if i am able to. So to be clear i'm not self diagnosing, but i'm constantly reading up on these subjects and honestly everything seems to make so much more sense.

So that's a little bit on how I have felt about my first semester of physics.

The thing is, beside physics, I'm also very interested in biology. Our university has a small biology faculty and it seems to be much cozier than 200-300 people in physics. The longer i've thought about it, the more i find myself interested in life and the parts of science that deal with living things. I took biology as a Basiskurs (a course that has less lessons and is more simplified compared to Leistungskurs) and I loved it. At school i've done several presentations in both physics and biology (and ethics) and I loved doing those, I find it's so much fun to research things and share them with others in a way that's engaging and comprehensive. I watch science videos and listen to podcasts in my free time as well, like Scishow (both vids and podcasts) and books like The Selfish Gene (that i found super interesting and recommend!!), and generally beside physics, a lot of them have a lot to do with biology. I find that these pieces of media don't overwhelm me and i want to know more about them, in general all kinds of stuff that have to do with life feel like tangible things to me and they kind of fall into place in the big scheme of things. I hope i phrased that in a way that's understandable.

I will implement new strategies in the coming semester and am in the process of hopefully getting a private tutor. I'm determined to go through my second semester in physics and reevaluate things after, but the way things are looking for me mentally right now, i think going with something that is naturally and directly engaging and has a sense of novelty and many little rewards that are directly applicable (so: biology) would lighten the load for now. Going into uni i talked with some advisors from both faculties on doing two bachelors, they said it was possible but i should rather wait. I would even consider doing them one after another with no overlap (of course i'd have to start working a job too eventually, to afford rent and basic expenses, right now i have a very amazing scholarship and mainly my parent's support paying for that)

The direction that would unite like, almost if not all of my interests well (given my current level of being informed) would be neuroscience. I think it's just in the sweet spot between big stuff and small stuff -ie. humans between particles and the universe and it has that direct application to life that i'm looking for as well as physics and biology. My dad is a surgeon and he has inspired me a lot to look into things that have to do with humans and with medicine, and when we learned about the brain in bio in hs i was always like ""heh i can't wait to learn more about this"". So far it's been the most definite career that i could see myself pursuing in the area of science. I want to help people and i want to feel like i am needed.  
I still wish to pursue physics, because i love it after all and I Want To Understand Those Things!!!!(tm) also the experience and learned methods are definitely very valuable and give good prospects. I know it will remain a passion. But maybe it could be better to do it when I have the resources, support system that i also have control over, and maturity to do so.

TLDR: first semester of physics was a lot to handle partly because of inexperience and partly because it's A Lot, took a toll on me mentally. Implementing new and improved strategy for second semester, will see how things turn out. However, also want to do biology at one point, maybe doing it earlier would benefit my mental wellbeing more? Would love to combine both in future job, not sure of the road to there though.

Question to you: Have you had any experiences like this? Is it worth it to keep pushing? Will things change?  
Also: if you have experience starting out in physics and then going into biology later (maybe even not from a bachelors, like from a masters with overlap in bio or a job) how is that road?

I graduated high school with really good grades, so basicly I could have chosen any major. I studied CS in high school and I was second in my class. So I took my teachers and my parents advice and I applied for CS.

In my first semester I already wanted to leave, I was depressed and it took a huge toll on my mental health. I have really supportive parents and they told me to stay. I stayed and finished with good grades and even got ""scholarship"" (money for my grades). I even got a trainee job at a local factory. 

But, as soon as the second semester started it hit me again. Not depression but suicidal thoughts and no positive outlook for the future. I hate going to class and can't even pay attention. I feel like I don't care about computers and it feels soulless. I told my parents about it again but they are still telling me to stay. I told my friends about it and a cousin of mine who I'm really close with but I was told to stay, it will be better.

Now, I don't know what I wanna do in life. I'm interested in a lot of topics but I'm not invested in them that much. I only know that I don't wanna do this anymore. I'm not lazy, I just can't do things I'm not interested in, but I put max effort into things that I like/enjoy.

I came here because I wanted to make friends, start dating and have a social life, something that I didn't put a lot of time into when I was in high school. But I'm starting to wonder whether or not it's worth it

The truth is that I don't care about the classes I'm taking or the writing degree I'm pursuing. My dream was really to start an animation Youtube channel, but I knew that wasn't going to bring in enough of a living. That's why I pursued the degree: so I could have a job outside of Youtube to provide a living. But I also have a disability that prevents me from even handling a proper part time job

And the worst part is, I'm not even doing that good. I'm getting a handle on my classes, sure, but my problem is organization. And my media addiction. I've always had an addiction to screens and video games and now that I have free rain with them, they've just been interfering with my ability to manage my time. As a result, studies end up taking most of my time and I feel like I can't schedule hanging out with anyone, or work on animating or work on drawings for my Twitter account

I just don't know what I'm doing anymore. I'm making my parents pay, travelling three whole states away, running away from what I really want to do (which even now just seems silly) just so I can make friends my age that I can't find where I live. But if I don't do this, I'm going to have a harder time getting a job to support myself, and I won't have nearly the same opportunities to make friends like I have in college. I'm causing my parents so much strife and anxiety to the point where they've somewhat given up on helping me. I feel lost and out of control, and I don't know where I'm going

88,OutrageousHornet9596,1646861431,/r/college/comments/tai540/my_plan_for_college_is_different_from_my_parents/,"Its as the title says. I'm 17F and am going to graduate from high school this year. Throughout high school, I've taken many classes for college credit through a program with the local community college. A few weeks ago, my mom and I met with a representative from the community college that visits the high school to answer any questions students may have. During this, she basically said that I have one more semester to do classes for my chosen major and then I have an associates degree (which is great since I can get my tuition waived).

That was always the plan that I would finish community college first before starting a 4-year university. Its the cheaper option and during attendance, I can continue working at my barista job.

But the problem comes with plans after I finish community college. I declared my major as social services, particularly with helping foster children find homes, and I'm pretty set on that in my mind. I've had a college picked out that I really like, it has everything I like and it's a great school. It's more on the expensive side, but I would only be paying for two years, and with my grades and such, I could get a good chunk of money from scholarships.

My parents, however, have been bringing up one other college to me whenever its the topic of conversation. I'll say something about my college, and then they'll say something along the lines of ""Well if you went to [their chosen college], you could do this.""

They always bring up stuff about the college they want, which is closer to home, is a good school, and a cheaper option. But its not what I want to do. And I feel like they don't really understand how much I want to go to the school I picked. One of the reasons is that their school is closer to home. But I'm going to be going to college and living at home for a semester. Why can't I go to college and live there for 2 years? I know its more expensive, but I have the resources and connections to set up a good plan to pay for it.

I dont know. I know what I want to do, but im having problems figuring out how. I really like this school, and I want to go to it, even if it means living away from home for a while. There's nothing really wrong with the school my parents picked, but it's not my decision. What do I do here?

For reference, I live in Ohio and I want to go Miami University. My parents have been bringing up Wright State University.",college,My plan for college is different from my parents' plan.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tai540/my_plan_for_college_is_different_from_my_parents/,1646879431.0
89,Dorocello,1646481141,/r/college/comments/t77wl5/i_have_to_make_a_very_important_life_decision/,"Hello everyone, I hope you're doing well, I don't know where to post this so I'm posting it here. In a few days, I have to make a very important decision regarding higher education which will directly affect the next 10 years of my life and I wanted to ask for advice from someone who has been in the real world. I will try to be as detailed as possible, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

First and foremost, I live in the middle east, so life here is a bit different from western and eastern countries. I studied mechanical engineering in high school and I was really good at it. Upon graduating I was encouraged to enroll in a 2-year community college for a practical engineering degree. I am now 19 and almost done with my first year and I didn't like it very much because I realized that it isn't what I wanted to do. I graduated on an honors roll and know that I can do more with my life than an associate's degree. I tried to transfer to a different major but got rejected multiple times. In a few days, I will have to decide if I will continue to the second year of a degree or drop out and go to the military for 3 years. My family and teachers want me to stay but I don't know that I don't want to do this profession for the rest of my life. There will be massive consequences to this decision for there are pros and cons to getting this degree:

The pros of getting the degree:

1) As a practical engineer I will earn a higher salary in the military and will be able to save most of it because I don't need to pay for food and housing. After my service, I will be able to afford to study in a good university without getting into debt (hopefully) or even studying abroad and getting citizenship in a different country which I might do in the future.

2) Because of the saved money I won't need to work (or at least work as much) meaningless college jobs like fast food or retail while studying to earn money and can focus fully on my education.

3) If I will end up having a change of heart and decide to major in this specific field, I will be able to shorten my higher education by a year, and with possible scholarships, reduce my expenses even further. In addition, the work experience in the military will help me stand out in the job market, but currently, this is the least of my concerns.

The cons of getting the degree:

1) If I finish the degree I will need to serve an additional 1.5 years in the military. This is a problem because I won't be able to leave. Most people end up doing something they dislike in there, and if that's the case I will be doing it for longer. In addition to this, I'm afraid that I will be finishing the degree and working purely for the money, and I know how soul-sucking and miserable these jobs can be.

2) When I'm going to finish my service I will likely be 24 by then. Even in my country, most people get a bachelor's at 24-25, I will get it at 28 if I go immediately after I finish serving which makes me feel behind in life, especially to the average person who has gotten their degree at 22. I will be spending most of my 20s in academia and the military which doesn't give me a lot of spare time due to opportunity costs.

3) On its own the practical engineering degree isn't worth much even with the work experience, especially the mechanical engineering one which encourages those who have it to go to university regardless. Because I will most likely end up majoring in a different field, I feel like all of those extra years spent would be wasted for nothing.

4) This is my personal problem. Getting an associate's degree in my country is only good for those who can't or don't want to get a bachelor's for academic reasons (or those who want a mundane government job). Most of my class is filled with underachievers and the material is taught accordingly. I barely managed to get through the first year due to the absolute boredom and thought that I was wasting my life. This damages my straight-A student ego knowing that I could leave this place and go to a normal college to get a more valuable degree that would make me more money in the future like EE or CS, but the thought of getting into debt and working overtime while studying already challenging curriculum doesn't bring me comfort either.

&amp;#x200B;

To conclude: I am still not sure what I want to do in the future but I won't have a lot of money to spare. In addition, I keep reading online that mechanical engineering is a dead-end field with few opportunities and that all capable people should go into tech. I also keep reading that you should be doing something that you're good at even if you don't like it instead of following your passion. If anyone can offer a real-world perspective on this situation i would be very grateful.

What I wanted to do was go to a university, or two years of community then go to a university. I never liked school, and was always terrible due to learning disabilities that were never really taken care of at my previous schools. It's not that I hate the teachers or students, or anything like that. I want to be able to attend and do well, but I just can't. I feel like if I took in perosn classes I would do much better, but my college doesn't offer almost any in person ones. I would like to drop out, but I'm worried about financial aid stuff, and ik my mother wants me to get an associates degree. She wants this to be my decision and she doesn't require it or anything, and I'm sure could understand if I told her all this, so with her, I'm just afraid she won't be happy. I currently have a decent job that I'm pretty okay with, and has soemthing to do with a potential career. It's not high paying or anything, but it's a decent job for an 18 year old. I don't mind the job too much, and I may enjoy it more if I wasn't so stressed for college all the time. But college I dread, because I'm missing so many assignments, and I don't want to, but I'll probably fail. I have adhd, anxiety, and a couple learning disabilities i cant remeber the exact names of, one is a processing problem, so I take awhile to process some things (for a basic description), and a math related problem. Idk if it is, but its probably similar to dyscalculia. I know I don't 100% need college to do well in life, but I always wante do be safe and just might as well get a degree to be safe. My friends, I have one who's attending a university, and the other two don't attend any sort of college (though one moved, not far, but moved, and its been a but since we talked so if they started attending a community college i wouldnt know. And i have one other friend but theyre still a senior in hs).

My main worry is about financial aid, because I don't know what would happen if dropped out or took a break. I don't know too much about it, my mother actually set most of it up, so I don't know what grants and all I have exactly. I don't want to have to pay anything back or whatever.


TL;DR: online college is absolutely terrible, already about to fail the 3 classes im taking, failed 1/3 the last term, I want to drop out or take a break, but worried about financial aid which I don't fully understand. I have learning disabilities that make something already hard 1000x harder.",college,I just can't with college anymore,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/t60s0j/i_just_cant_with_college_anymore/,1646357013.0
91,Crock-A-Gator,1646198131,/r/college/comments/t4simt/i_feel_behind_and_lost/,"  

So, to start, I want to get some initial information out there. I graduated high school in 2019 at the age of 17. I am **M\\20**, now in my 6th semester of college as a ""junior"". But basically, where a freshman would be at. 

I feel like I have made so many mistakes when it has come to schooling. Too many to count. Highschool I never tried, didn't care, didn't study, and overall didn't do anything that wasn't required to do. And sometimes not even that. I didn't try to learn, for example, never tried in math at all (which will come up later), cheated on what schoolwork I was able to cheat on, and relied on everyone else to do the work for me. In fact, I think I did homework in high school a total of 5-10 times max. I specifically remember a PLTW class that I did not do a single thing the entire semester/year however long the class was. It was group-based, and I was paired with some good friends who were smart ash and tried hard in school (I will mention these two again later). All in all, I did not set myself up with a good work ethic or study habits. And I especially didn't set myself up with good grades to aid in college at all. Speaking of college, I had no idea what I wanted to do. Our school counselors in high school as well as my parents PUSHED me extremely hard to go into a community college because of the A+ program and how I could ""save SO MUCH money"", and just ""go into college with an associate degree and be right where you would have been anyways"". And to clear it up my dad did not go to college; my mom went and got a BSAD degree, and they were both extremely uninterested in helping me with anything to do in college. Or really with life. They were busy getting divorced and running a couple separate businesses that didn’t do to hot for our family life. Which (at the time) was 100% okay with me because I just didn't want to worry about college and didn't care. They just seemed to let me figure it out myself which is still the case and has been the case for the last couple of years since I have been in college. Didn't talk about degrees, ideas, pros, and cons, universities, or literally anything at all with anything to do about college. I did all my financial aid alone, like figuring out payments, classes, tours of school and anything else you could think of that goes into college. I think they just thought it was an easy way to go and ""saved money"" which was fine with them for some reason even though they aren't paying for any schooling. 

This brings me to my first transition going to college. My first semester was GREAT. Easy classes still didn't know what I wanted to do, just kind of riding the wave and commuting with a different group of friends from high school, and all ended up getting very close. Taking just normal general education classes like English, writing, math, college success class, and a computer applications class. I still cheated and hardly tried, did about as little as I could still. (I got caught plagiarizing in my writing class and my prof. pulled up the exact article I copied from in class and read it out loud coincidentally. When he saw my paper, he knew what I did. Anyways, some of those classes were a joke. I was fine with the grades I was getting even though some classes were 'pass/fail' and didn't count as any credits like 'pre-algebra' and 'developmental writing'. I didn't take any math I didn't HAVE to take in high school as I said earlier, and it fucked me because I had to take every single math class from the ground up at the most basic level starting at pre-algebra.

I feel like I am rambling on and on and on, so anyways I end up going for four more semesters (5 in total) at this same college and kind of doing the same thing honestly. It is embarrassing to say but I did, I cheated when I could, didn't study, and cared more but not as much as a successful college student should. This community college and airhead advisors had me taking every single general education under the sun I ended up with about 59 earned credits after 5 semesters. And by this time, I had decided I wanted to major in computer science. I thought because I like computers, video games, and technology this would be a great choice. Plus, some good friends (high school PLTW friends) were going into engineering, so STEM sounded great. I did not realize anything this entailed or how bad I fucked up in school and in that community college. The last math class I completed was college algebra and that was one of the classes during covid and I cheated 100% the entire thing. I tried to study but would get frustrated and just quit then cheat and get through it. Come to find out comp sci goes to calc three, plus stats, and discrete math. That was and is the least of my worries now though. 

**Also, important note here** \- I feel like I focused a lot on the cheating aspect and unmotivated aspect. In all reality, it doesn't matter or feel like it matters that much I cheated on history and different classes like that. I didn't or don't need them in my degree and I could care less about it. I could wrap my head wasting so much time over learning about stuff that doesn't interest me and isn't going to help at all with anything. I am not trying to defend it. That was just my reasoning. Math obviously is a different story. Maybe I am wrong and that conditioned me to do things wrong, I whole heartly don’t know. 

Once I got to my 5th semester at that community college, I already knew I ""wanted"" to major in comp sci as I said. I didn't even get an associate degree in computer science or any kind for that matter after that last semester. But I didn't think it was going to be a big deal as I was told by friends and some other people it would really matter that much while transferring. The advisors did say it might be harder to transfer credits but after everything they made me do and how much I hated it at that community college, I didn't care what happened. Big mistake. And by this point in my life, I was looking down a direction and for the first-time kind of getting excited about knowing where I wanted to go and how I was going to get there no matter how hard it is with a degree in comp sci. Hopefully figuring out my life, doing something productive and meaningful. I was proud to say I am transferring to this university to study computer science. Then I was told by the university I was transferring to that almost none of my credits will be able to be transferred because of equivalency from course to course. At first, I was destroyed. They told me I basically have 4 years left and I am going to have to start from the beginning. 3 days after I heard that I was still just devastated, I thought those 2.5 years were wasted. But I switched advisors and my new advisor told me we can figure something out and see what is going on. Basically, I took WAY too many general education classes and not degree-specific classes at my community college, as well as not getting an associate degree so really nothing transferred or was equivalent to any courses. And for some reason, idiot me got my hopes up on our university's degree audit page and it says that I have 55 credits that have been transferred, 12 in progress, and 53 credits to go until I get a bachelor's degree. I have no idea why I didn't put this all in my head but those are just classes that did transfer over to the school but no matter what in any degree I run an audit on its all about 3 years minimum. So, I was going through all these emotions, from thinking I have 3 years, then to “alright I only have 2 years like I should”, to then again back to realizing I have even more time than I thought. 

So after, now this semester. I realized that I have close to 100 credits or about 3.5 years until I get any degree almost at all. Because hardly any classes from my community college transfer over as any sort of degree specific requirements. I hate computer science I am sick of it; I can't do math(pre-calc) to save my life, I have terrible study habits, and can't seem to get motivated although I truly want to. I truly want to do better. I was just coasting through the community college. And although I was cheating, I felt like I was turning it around and getting smarter and doing better last 2 semesters ago and especially last semester and was ready to come to a new school and try hard and make leeway on a degree. Now I failed both exams on the two most important classes I have, want to switch degrees, watching my friends from high school who tried and work hard (they happen to be my best friends) pass me up and go on and about to graduate with engineering degrees, while I am stuck basically at freshman-level courses I can’t pass. 

I just feel like a failure, I feel lost and so confused. I don't feel like I am smart enough for school, I don't feel like I have the study habits it takes, I don't even know if I want to go through with another 3-to 4 years of schooling.

Even after all this typing which is the longest post I have ever posted by far, I think I did a terrible job summing it up and explaining. In my mind, this feels like 5% of my thoughts. I talked down on myself about a lot of different things, I don't think I did everything wrong. I had an internship last summer for computer science, and another one this summer with a company that is supposed to be one of the ""top 100 internship programs in the country"". But all in all, I am so far behind in college it just kills me, I wish I did stuff differently, I wish I instilled a better work ethic and study habits when I was younger, I wish I had more support. I am trying to turn it around I just have no idea how at all. Everyone can make excuses about everything if they don't succeed, I don't want to seem like the type to complain about everything. I just feel like I did A LOT of stuff wrong ALOT of different times, as well as getting a couple of iffy hands in this confusing game of poker we call life :/

**I hope everyone reading this can truly smile, wake up and say with 100% honesty that they are happy. That is true success.** And I hope to be successful one day. I need to remember this too, **“everything will be okay”**. I know I wasn’t the best person, student, friend, brother, employee, boyfriend, or anything in my life but I just hope and pay everything will be okay.

I would love to go do an excavation somewhere, but you have to pay to work on those and I barely have any money to my name. I've been looking at paid internships because I am graduating next year and need something on my resume. Pretty much all of them are HR/Business/STEM related, and they want people in one of those majors. Even if I had a background in any of these, they want people majoring in those fields. I don't qualify for anything, and it's getting really frustrating. If I can't find an internship, I'll probably have to go work a fast food job again this summer. My school hasn't been a ton of help. I revised my resume on an advisor's advice, but I simply don't have the experience that many of these internships require. I don't have my parents paying for everything like most of the students at my school, so it has to be paid.

 What are some resources that you all have found helpful, or do you just apply to internships you don't qualify for and hope for the best? 

I'd also like to point out that yes, I would probably change my major, but I'm too far in and don't want to spend thousands more dollars to spend more time in college. Therefore, telling me what I should have done is not helpful.

93,ApeBlender,1645997865,/r/college/comments/t2yivq/study_electrical_engineering_at_u_of_m_or_nearby/,"        I'm a highschool senior living in West Michigan choosing between two schools to study engineering at right now: University of Michigan and Oakland University. Oakland University is a medium sized school with around 12,000 students and good engineering programs. It has stuck out to me throughout my college application process because of the many merit and financial need based scholarships I'm eligible for there. My family is well off enough but my parents can't afford to pay for any of my college so I'll be taking out student loans or paying out of pocket for everything. Money has been a big factor throughout the process. 
        I applied to U of M just to see if I got in, I wasn't really planning on attending due to the money issue. However, this changed a few days ago. I received an email that I'd been accepted to U of M which was awesome, and I also received the HAIL scholarship which is full tuition for 4 years. Now it's not so clear to me if I should go to Oakland or U of M. 
       At Oakland I've received scholarships covering full tuition and half of housing. As it stands Oakland will cost $6,000 a year not counting local scholarships per additional Oakland application based scholarships. 
         U of M currently will cost around $12,000 a year currently, however I haven't received my financial aid offering from them yet. 
         I've always been a small town guy and honestly the size and scope of U of M is intimidating to me. The accounts of snobby and arrogant students don't thrill me either. I've visited Oakland and done lots of research on it and to a certain extent I've fallen in love with it. The location is a plus for me as not too far north there are beautiful woodlands and natural areas I'd like to camp in and explore. Oakland has a great advising and job placement program which I've heard can be hard to find at Michigan due to the large student body. However, I recognize that U of M will probably provide a better education and more opportunities anyways, but right now I can't decide if that will be worth the extra money. 
        I'm fairly outgoing but I wouldn't describe myself as competitive (easygoing would be a better term) which from what I've read is a big deal if you're trying to thrive at U of M. I want to be social in college but I don't ever plan on drinking or partying so that's not an issue for me. There are various other cons that come with attending U of M vs Oakland, most of them related to the size of the school (transportation - especially for engineers living on the north campus - and parking seem to be a big headache which is a problem for me as I plan on driving to Lansing quite frequently).
        The main problem here is I've obviously never been to college, and I don't know what a college experience is like, so how could I possibly compare them. In the end the decision will still fall on me, but if anyone has any words of advice I would greatly appreciate them.

Also there's probably a couple hundred things I forgot to mention so if there are important factors I've left out feel free to ask and I will share.",college,Study Electrical Engineering at U of M or nearby medium sized school?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/t2yivq/study_electrical_engineering_at_u_of_m_or_nearby/,1646015865.0
94,praisethedead,1645697780,/r/college/comments/t07lxj/need_help_with_a_friend_in_my_college/,"Hang on people. It’s about to get rough. 

So, I have this friend. Let’s call him “Tim”. I met him in school and we have been friends for a few years, we are both in the same music program in university. Tim doesn’t have a lot of other friends besides me. Maybe one or two, but I think friendship is something he struggles with. I’ll admit, his behaviour can be weird and childish sometimes (this could be due to a condition - I am not sure) and I can understand why other people in my cohort refuse to hangout with him and describe his presence as “annoying and uncomfortable”. I also realize this about Tim, but he’s got a good sense of humour, and I love playing music with him, so I’ve continued to stay in touch and hang out, trying to keep it casual.

Throughout the course of our friendship, Tim has become quite “clingy” and demanding of me. He always is asking who I am with, or what I am doing. He asks me for rides and favours all the time. He will call me, and message me several times a day, and if I don’t answer he just keeps going. When I answer, it’s not like he needs anything because he just tries to make casual conversation/joke around/ask me to hangout. He is always asking me to spend time with him, go to events, etc., but I am busy, I have several other friendships to maintain, a girlfriend I just started seeing, school, work, job interviews, house obligations, self care... you get the point, I am a busy guy. If I decline his offer to hangout, he asks why I can't hangout, or picks at my excuse instead of just accepting it and moving on.

I think he is also jealous of me. I am not even sure where to begin handling that. I go on dates with girls sometimes, and he always tells me that he can never get girls to like him, and that hes hopeless, you know, all that incel shit. He also seems jealous of my other friendships, and my shitty old car (even though he has plenty of money to buy a car himself). Sometimes it seems like he is trying to convince me that my life sucks, I mean, its not great but I am getting by all right.

ENTER THE LAST STRAW:

On Monday morning he asked me to come over and record some music in the evening, and I agreed. I had the night free, and I love to play and record music with Tim. I messaged him that afternoon asking what time I should come by, and he replied with ""I'm tired"". I asked again if he wanted to record and play music tonight, and he said ""I thought you would already be on your way? Don't you know that you have your own choices in life?"". I called him on his B.S and told him that there was no need to be grumpy or rude, because I'm just trying to find out what the plan for the evening is. He was triggered by me calling him grumpy, and proceeded to call me disrespectful, and use every name in the book. Then, he calmed down and asked me to come over again, and I said that I don't want to hangout if he's in a bad mood. He started telling me that he is older than me (we are both mid 20s, I think he's 2 years older) and that I need to respect him. I continued calling him on his B.S, because I am an adult and who is going to put up with this shit. I told him not to talk to me like that, and to stop messaging and calling, and that I am not coming over. He proceeded to give me vague physical threats, tell me that he would have me kicked out of the university, and evicted from my apartment. He kept telling me ""you're done"", ""you are so fucked"", that sort of thing.

At this point I'm worried. Tim is going ballistic on me. He doesn't have any real dirt on me to get me expelled or evicted, but I don't want to deal with squashing whatever bullshit that he told the dean, classmates, or whatever. So after about 1 hour of what felt like dealing with an 5 year old, I managed to talk him down from his anger. He gave me an apology, blamed in on some condition that he has, which seemed sincere but I'm really not sure. I accepted the apology, because I am TOO DAMN NICE. Maybe I shouldn't have. I don't know.

Today he messaged me asking if I can do some errands for him, because he's stressed. Like... dude ... are you serious???? I said no and he said he would pay me, I still said no and he started going off about how he has a headache and how it'll take him 3 hours by bus to do his errands. Like thats my problem or something. I'm not sure if he thinks I'm supposed to be scared of him because of his tantrum on Monday, and just agree to do favours for him, or what. He also asked me to go to punk show with him tomorrow. I told him I'm broke and can't go, because I don't want to go, and its a free show, so now I don't have an excuse. I want to tell him that he has been a lot to handle and I'm fine staying friends, but I need some space especially after all the shit he's been doing. But, its like walking on egg shells because I don't want him to snap on me and threaten me with slander again.

Mother of God, that was a long post. Sorry, friends.

I have a strange jealous friend named Tim who doesn't understand boundaries, has threatened me with slander, and is causing me a lot of stress in my personal life.

This is my first semester at a 4-year, I previous was at a CC for the off and on 8 years of school. I've had to pretty much work full time this entire time while in school which is why it has been taking me forever to finish since I drop out frequently due to the burn out. 

My general eds were pretty much finished so I moved onto a university to finally get my bachelors this semester. I'm only 2 months into my first semester and the burn out is insane. I work 40+ hour weeks in retail and my entire life is working, school until 2-3am when I get home and then going back to work on a few hours of sleep. Some weeks I work 10+ days a in a row without a day off. I'm failing most of my courses already because of submitting assignments late. I've been having frequent mental breakdowns and panic attacks every week. Many people have suggested to go to school part time but at this point I am so close to finishing, maybe 3 semesters away and stretching this out longer will force me to take out more loans. I've already pretty much used loans only to fund my education and have racked up a lot of debt over the years. Even with working full time, I can't afford to pay for classes since I pay rent, car payments, and utilities etc.

I've only managed to pay $9,000 in the past 9 months though...

Parents don't know I got kicked out because I never told them about my depression and locking myself in a room for 2yrs. I went home every month pretending all was dandy in my life because all I wanted was to get some comfort at home. I almost got ""caught"" several times because there were receipts from me paying the college back but I made some BS and made it seem like I was still attending college because I got scared and couldn't drop the college student act. I pretend like I live in the dorms when I live with a rando in an apartment for cheap. I pretend I go to class when I work and instead.

Mental health is something not taken seriously by my family even though they love me lots (I'm the baby of the family and honestly get spoiled). I ran away in high school but all they did was get me medication and the topic was never brought up again. No therapist no help. Getting myself help and advocating for myself wasn't on my mind back in high school and the beginning of college because in that mental state, I couldn't even fathom telling a single person I was so broken. I could only leave my room late at night and I always felt scared to leave my room. If only I had told my parents I wanted to take a leave of absence, but how could I dare tell them that?

However I met the right people last summer and happened to get a part time job that rekindled my passion for my degree. I have my head on straight now when it comes to academics. I can be in the real world, a little anxious, but I have the willpower to continue my degree and get my ""dream job"".

I want to go back to school, I want to be able to go back home, but I can't tell my parents the truth. My anxiety won't let me even drop the college student act. I can't ""just tell them"".

Congrats! but this is also a critical student status bc many can lack the financial or emotional support to succeed in college to reverse their socio economic status. 

Me: 33F Put myself through college w/o any financial, emotional, or mental support from *family.* My father was absent and my mother and I have no relationship-neither went to college. Honestly, I only went to college bc I have 2 cousins my age and we were in school together K-12. Their father &amp; mother were very supportive so going to college was expected of them. So naturally, I decided to still try and keep up with them so I decided I'd go too bc I was just as good as them academically, but their greatest advantage was having a support system. 

They finished on time but it took me over 9 yrs of stopping and starting over, changing majors, relocating, balancing rent, bills and tuition, a full time job and going full time when I was able to. I graduated with a degree in the arts and can't get a job in any art field although I've applied to many different art related jobs I'm qualified for over the last 4 yrs since graduating. 

Now I'm thinking about going back for another degree that's actually in demand like IT or healthcare. The art world doesn't seem penetrable and my curriculum didn't match employer requirements or expectations. But not all art programs are like this I'm sure.

At my age, I wonder if I should have become a business owner instead of being a student all of those yrs. I say this bc the wealthiest people I know don't have degrees-but own businesses instead. If I could do it over again as a first generation student, I would've went into the service first and traveled b4 deciding on a career or major. Or I would've traveled first while researching the economy to find out what majors are good ROIs. If I could do it again, I likely would have majored in becoming an art teacher or marketing and fine arts would have been my minor or even a post bac. My degree feels like a certificate for a hobby but I still hope one day I can use it. 

I followed my passion but it has not been rewarding... at least not yet. It actually caused me more debt trying to escape poverty.

I really dont want to right a whole essay about my problems and situation, so I try to keep it short.

In September 2019 I started studying High Tech Manufacturing in Vienna an the FH Campus Wien, thinking this is my dream. After 6 years in a technical school (called HTL in Austria), i finished my  Higher School Certificate (Matura) in  mechanical engineering and mechatronics. I was always ""pushed"" into the Technical area by my family and till i was 19/20 I persuaded myself that I will become and Engineer and that this is what I want. Well to be clear, i love Technology, to be more exactly cars. But the last 2/3 years were literally hell for me. The first two semester were kinda easy for me because it was mostly just repeating stuff I learend in my old school, but the problem began in December 2019. I was more and more and more bored of the subjects and lost complete interest. But because of bad conscience regarding my parents and my stubbornness i proceeded to continue. Then came my diagnosed depression, because

 a) I had 0 Motivation

 b) suddenly my succes fell rapidly off  (I had never problems with learning, my whole life and it was kinda easy for me until now)

c) i was late diagnosed with ADHD (may 2020)  and never had any kind of therapy until now

\[d) maybe this stupid Covid shit\]

 I needed to pause for a time, so I had a break for half a year and tried to focus on my mental health and work. This year was really good for my health and i started to feel joy again and became more and more motivated. Well September 2020 my studies started again and POOF, i was in the same dark hole. This is now my problem. Besides Technology, I freaking love Art and Design and since I was a kid i was always drawing cars and dreamed to became a Car Designer. I dont see any future and/or happiness regarding my studies now and I want to start studying Industrial Design, but in the same time I dont want these years I studied go to waste and disappoint my parents. I already have a really bad conscience towards my parents thinking about dropping out because the pay the tuition fees (around 400€ per Semester) and starting something new. Plus ""WHEN"" i finished my Industrial Design Degree i would be 29 (it takes 10 semesters in vienna) and  I can't deal with the fact that I won't really be in real working life until I'm 29. But in the same time I am really unhappy and it feels like I am falling deeper and deeper into my hole.

&amp;#x200B;

So I came here on this Subreddit for advices. Should I drop out or bite threw it and finish my current classes.

Weeks ago I applied for an art school I really wanted to go to and got accepted recently, I was very exited and ready to start college, while filling out the fafsa I asked my dad if he could help me put his tax information and his response was ""can't you do it without me? Can't you put that you are independent? I don't claim you as a dependent anymore in taxes"" after a discussion he actually let me put his tax information. Well the days passed and he never mentioned anything about how he would help me pay for college, so today I asked him how he is gonna help me pay for it, and he looked at me with a weird face and said ""I'm not helping you"" ""you are already an adult and should be responsible for your own college tuition"" I asked him about the savings he told me he had for my college and he did not say anything and proceeded to tell me that he will not be there for me all the time and he doesn't want to give me everything to my hand, he said he would help me with stuff like If I need a book, or gas money but anything else I have to pay it for my self.

So right after I we finished talking, I proceeded to tell my mom and my grandma about the situation and they did get really pissed about the false promise of my dad helping with college, but unfortunately my mother cannot talk to my dad because my dad blocked my mom's number, and in social media for many other other problems I have had with my father, so my mom and I had to tell my grandma (my dad's mom) and then my grandma told my uncle, so then I talked to my uncle and offered me to go live with him (he has offered me this before because of some problems I have been having with my step mom and dad) and he would help me pay for college, so I'm almost a 100% sure to leave my dad and get out of the house and live with my uncle, also as I have said before there has been alot more problems with my dad besided this one that makes me want to get out of the house and go live with my uncle, but I would feel bad for leaving my dad, I don't know if I am the one who is wrong in this situation or my dad?",college,My father won't help me pay for college even when said was going to before,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/sujxe8/my_father_wont_help_me_pay_for_college_even_when/,1645104550.0

I've done trade certifications, work in a relatively secure field but when it comes to doing college my brain explodes.

I have signed up for 3-4 classes over the last idk 5 years. And dropped them all within the first week. And you know I had to eat that cost and pay out of pocket. I even flipped out and cussed out a professor during week 1 and it was not their fault, they were doing their ""job"" (although to me arguably they are not doing their job, giving people a syllabus and having them post on a forum is not higher education if you ask me, it's not even teaching but tomato potato), anyways I had a mental explosion and took it out on someone who was doing what they were told was acceptable by their superiors so it's not really their fault.

NOW- I signed up for a class a few weeks ago. It starts next week. I got an email about it. And now I am freaking out again. I mean I am sweating and my hands are a little shaky and it's hard to breathe and I hate it and I want to drop the class. I think once I finish one class I will get over this feeling though.

103,Independent_Editor62,1644068870,/r/college/comments/sl7bxd/im_genuinely_unhappy_in_my_college_and_i_want_to/,"For some context/disclaimer, I do not live nor study in the US, but I am American (I am stating this for a fairly important point that I'll bring up). 

I am currently a junior, and I am not happy at all in the college that I go to.

The only reason why I go here is because it's the only one that is the closest to me (20-30 minutes travel time) and my mom was an alumni of this school. The environment isn't necessarily toxic, but there is a reason why I only have 7 friends in this place and more friends from other universities. It's also fairly homogenous in terms of gender identity, which made me feel like I was in high school again (because I went to an all-girls school). I also don't think my school is as known as the ones that my friends go to, which is honestly important if I want to land a job a good company in the future.

I feel like my school didn't prepare me at all for the workforce, skillwise and mentally, and my growth as an individual has been stumped. I spend almost all of my days accomplishing requirements or doing readings for my courses, or resting from the exhaustion of doing so (which actually doesn't happen that often haha). Because of this, I don't really have time to pursue internships (which is something that is fairly common among college students in my country and a total resume booster) and develop the skills that I wouldn't get from school. My school also lacks a lot of options when it comes extracurriculars and student organizations (and almost all of them are limited to certain majors) so I can't really pursue interests that I am really passionate about. 

Although my school has (finally, at the insistence of my mom) applied and are waiting for an approval, for the past three years I wasn't able to use my GI bill for school since my school wasn't approved by the VA at the time I started college. (For more context about this, the GI bill is an education benefit given to US service members or veterans. My dad served in the Navy and was given one, but since he went to college prior to joining the military he transferred it to me so I can use it instead). If my college were to get accepted, I would only be able to use it during my senior year, which would be a complete waste since I don't really plan on going to grad school after college (especially since a lot of the programs that I'm interested in require work experience so I really need to get a job). 

There are also a lot of other reasons such as my physical and mental health, which has gradually and greatly suffered as each semester passed by. (I lost a lot of weight and I just feel sad and anxious every day).

Anyway I just want to know is it still even worth it to transfer to another university? I am in my second semester of my junior year, which means I only have two semesters left after this and then I am done with college forever. Moreover, there is a pretty good chance that my college might get approved by the VA, which would probably waste the efforts of the school admin in getting all the documents together for that (then again there's another person in my college who wants to use a GI bill according to my mom). There's also the fact that my parents and I might need to go to the VA to tell them about my change of schools if ever, which is a whole hassle in itself since the regional office is in another city and we have to commute using public transportation because of traffic (I've been there before and the travel was NOT fun). And since I wasn't able to use the GI bill for 3 years, my parents had to pay for my tuition out of their own pocket, and I feel like my parents will get mad at me for wasting their money if I bring up the fact that I want to transfer. 

I'll go ahead and answer some questions that I may get from this:

* academically I am doing quite well, but it was at the expense of both my physical and mental health
* I'm an only child so I have no one to transfer the GI bill to 
* my parents didn't want to send me back to the US for college since they don't trust me to be alone lol 
* my dad doesn't want me to live with my aunt (she's my only family member in the US) if ever because of some private reasons (not my story to tell)
* considering the situation in the US right now (and the fact that I am Asian), I don't think it's a good idea to go back 

TLDR: I'm not happy in my college and I want to transfer because of job prospects, financial reasons, and because of my physical and mental health, but I don't know if it's worth it since I have one more year left.",college,"I'm genuinely unhappy in my college and I want to transfer, but is it worth it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/sl7bxd/im_genuinely_unhappy_in_my_college_and_i_want_to/,1644086870.0

My parents have established that I can pay for my state school (Rutgers) and I could go there, but any other school outside of the state would be too expensive. Even though Rutgers is a good school, as dumb as this sounds, I really don't want to go there. It has a bad rep at my school and its purely an ego thing for me. It sounds really shallow and selfish but I just can't let myself go there even though its a great school.

Its about 36k a year in total. I don't have access to my parent's finances, but I estimate they are somewhere between 200k-250k a year in income. I have 3 siblings, and because I am in the middle, when I am in college, somebody else always will. This means that the EFC on my fafsa is cut dramatically.

I can't get myself to do my homework, pay my bills, and do my homework.  Every day feels like I'm going to war with my brain trying to force it to desire the harder task. Instead, I pass my hours watching YouTube and Netflix.  

At the start of every semester I tell myself things are going to be different.  This will be the semester where I reclaim my academic drive and success.  In high school I was driven to succeed, It was common for me to pull all nighters if that's what it took to achieve.  I used to get this gut wrenching feeling that put me into action if there was a test the next day or a project that needs to be completed.  Yesterday, I missed an exam on purpose because I saw no point in going.  I didn't study, didn't read the textbook, couldn't get myself to do anything related to the course no matter how hard I try.  The worst part is, if I start studying, it isn't even that bad.  I actually enjoy what I'm studying but I can't get myself started for the life of me.  If I do start on something, the chances that I follow through and stay consistent are dismal.  I feel even more frustrated because I was a good student in high school and even achieved a 4.0 my first semester of college.  I want to achieve, but I can't put myself to action.  

I also do not have a single friend.  I'm part of some clubs but they meet inconsistently due to covid so it feels impossible to form a friendship. And when I have the chance to converse, I can't muster what to say because two years of isolation have devastated my social capabilities.  

I've ran away several times.  The pandemic has made it easier to run because I can do all my classes online.  For the first half of 2021, I was living in my car and couchsurfing across the country.  Eventually I ended up in California and stayed there for about 3 months.  I was working in a hostel and as door dash driver.  It was fun.  I made an amazing group of friends, and even landed my first girlfriend.  I was almost tempted to drop out and stay in California but ultimately I decided my best bet is to get my degree.  Thus, I returned home saying to myself things are going to be different. Spoiler: they weren't.  My grades weren't bad.  I had a 3.2 gpa.  The loneliness kicked in again and I ran away again.  I was talking with my girlfriend about how I was disatisfied 
with college and how I missed her. So, running from my problems again I went to go see my girlfriend... in Peru.  I spent about little over a month in Lima and Cusco and had a blast but my school moved back in person so I had to come home.   No surprise I still hate it here and still feel lonely and isolated.  
My parents think I'm fine.  They think I'm receiving good grades, but I'm failing a class.  They think I have a job, but I quit 5 months ago.  They still think I  have money, but I spent it all due to my impulsiveness.  

I feel afraid to go to my family, I've always had trouble opening up to my mom.  We get along, but if I have a problem she usually can't relate.  She just shrugs it off.  The only person I could feel like I could trust was my dad and he passed over a year ago so now I only have my girlfriend and one friend I can turn to but they both live on the other side of the world so it's hard.  

At times, I feel like college isn't for me.  However, I do love to learn.  I spend a lot of my free time reading philosophy, history, and studying linguistics.

I have been having a lot of thoughts about this for months and would really appreciate any input.

I'm from a student from a certain third-world country and planning to start my undergraduate studies (BComm Accounting or Finance) in Canada the coming fall. I just want to ask everyone's opinion on whether the costs are worth it.

The tuition fees for one year is around CAD 24k. I'll be doing part-time jobs to try to pay for my own rent and food. During the summer breaks, I'll be working full time to help contribute to next year's tuition fees.
The total amount of money needed from my parents for the whole degree will be around CAD 96k (not including my contributions from my summer jobs/co-ops).

My country is currently is in the worst state possible, going back under military rule. The economy is rapidly declining with the CAD exchange rate going up over 40 percent (still rising). Even the banks here are reluctant to let people withdraw money. ATMs are empty and we have to make bookings in advance just to take out our own money with a $300 cap fortnightly (it's just absurd). 

I plan to become a Canadian PR one day, which is the only way out of this miserable country for my family.

Due to the political situations, my family income is not in the best state (reduced to at least half). However, we're fortunate enough to have several invested properties. If the income situations get worse, my parents are thinking of liquidating a property (worth around CAD 350k) to fund for my education. (Our money is mainly tied up in real-estate investments, with the savings in the bank only able to cover about 2 or at most 3 years of my studies. I also have a younger sibling who will finish school in 2 years.)

Is it really worth this much trouble for my education or is it just better to keep the properties for later use? My parents are willing to spend this much for my education, but I can't help but feel guilty simply due to the sheer amount of money.

Aside from the community college that I go to, I don't really know a lot about it. So, my apologies if I am just ignorant of some basic fact. Anyways, my parents have sat me and my brothers down and told us that they would not be supporting us financially through college. We were, (I believe understandably) upset about this, and I just think that it doesn't even make any sense. It would be one thing if my parents could not afford it, but my dad makes over six figures, and saves a great deal of his money. (Recently though, he might get fired from his job due to refusing a COVID vaccine, but that doesn't really matter here.)

The main thing is that while I am going to basically be all on my own once I leave high school, I won't be able to get support from student aid programs due to how much money my family already makes. My parents aren't super knowledgeable when it comes to college, both of them dropped out before they could get their two-year degree. I really want to be able to go to a nice school and pursue a career in medicine, but I know that I will be struggling at best if I chose this route. They tell me that scholarships can easily cover my full cost, but my mom's college was paid for by her parents, and my dad dropped out after a year, so they don't really know a ton about this stuff. It just sucks to know I'll struggle more than I have to because of my parent's ""tough love"" by not supporting us at all.

Tw: mental heal

Tbh, I don't know if I can continue with life anymore. I'm so tired with everything. I get up only to stress over studying for a major that I, despite liking, probably won't be able to pass this semester, work at a job i don't like (to which the only other jobs I can work at are worse), stress over a student org leadership position that I hate (because it looks good on my resume), stress over my future prospects for a career that I hate the least (because I'm not smart enough or do not have the connections to get into fields that are somewhat interesting), and stress over the fact that I don't have an internship because it's probably screwing my employability in the future.

Essentially, the present has tired me out. I don't have any friends or family I can turn to. I dont have friends because I have given up so much time to a failed attempt to make my grades and resume look good. I can't go to my family because I have had to hide my identity (since middle school) in order to not get kicked out and be able to have a home. I don't have any more motivation to keep living. I hate waking up knowing that I have to go through another shitty day.

The future isn't any better. The only path I can see is to be stuck in a shitty job only to retire alone because I have already sabatoged any social life I could have had. And this is already ""good"" considering how I cant even manage my present situation, so I'd probably be homeless by then instead of even being in at least a shitty job that can pay the bills.

Idk what to do at this point. Is there even anything I can do? I can't afford to take a step back to reflect on what I really want to do due to social stigma from family/culture and financial reasons.

The advice I always hear is to major in your interests so that you have a good time and a good GPA. The only major I can think of which suits my interests is philosophy, which is known for its abhorrant job market. If it turns out I'm actually bad at philosophy and get a low GPA, or if I decide I don't want to go to law school after all, I'll be doomed (especially since I have no familial money to fall back on and would have debt from student loans). I could major in something else, but I have no garuntee that I will be very good at that; I might get rejected from law schools for having a bad GPA.

I go to a university with a lot of people and majors and I dorm there. 

My major is Art \[concentrated in animation\] but during my first semester as a freshman I realized how awful the program is.. I've joined an art major discord server from my school and a lot of the students (including the seniors) don't seem to draw at a professional level and I'm doing my best to be kind and considerate with that statement.. It's just not where I want to see myself in 4 years.

There are other things like food that I have to pay for which food alone is 1000$ per semester which is absolutely insane to me considering I have food allergies kinda so I can only eat about 10% of the food there, my dorm has disgusting bathrooms and I can't even wash my own dishes without using a disgusting sink in the trash room.

The campus is beautiful but I don't like knowing that 80% of my money is used to make the school look presentable when I'm not even going to learn what I have always wanted to do with my life.

I have TONS of financial aid and yet... 38,000$ is what I'll end up paying out of pocket??? what??? for this???

&amp;#x200B;

I've been researching other colleges, especially online colleges because I definitely don't want to pay ungodly amounts of money to dorm in a place that is disgusting, out of reach, etc.

Every art major graduate seems to regret college but my parents won't let me quit now that I've come so far (even though I've only passed 1 semester in my freshman year and I'd love to quit before I get too deep into this)

The thing is, there's a university that's about a 30 minute drive from my house

apparently it has started an animation program? (haven't seen much of it but I guess it's new) and my aunt who is a professor at Harvard recommended me to go there. Apparently, the math class I'd be taking this semester is not enough credit to get in even as a sophomore which I don't understand? (Why couldn't I just double up on math classes In a year) 

Besides that, my GPA and etc are borderline good enough to transfer there so I'm not even sure I'd make it in

but along with this university (which would be pretty much free considering my financial aid and not having to dorm) my Aunt said she'd pay for a trade school called Animschool which seems to have amazing reviews from people who have taken the classes. It is online but it will end up to cost around 12000 (possibly less). It seems that 82% of their graduates have landed careers within 6 months of graduating and this is all I want.

The thing is I don't think I'll make it into the university and I don't know what to do :c but I do believe that I'm a hard worker and having the motivation of having my dream career within a year of graduation will absolutely inspire me to work harder than ever.

On mobile, please forgive format. Will also be cross-posting to other subreddits. I am a little all over the place so please bare with me. 

I am 19F. 2020 and 2021 were rollercoasters for me in terms of living situation, college choice and life. 

I attended a private university for the first half of my freshmen year, Fall 2020. But due to financial constraints and overall BS I transferred to a local community college for Spring 2021. 

I took general courses in the Spring because I genuinely don't know what to do with my life but unfortunately my time at the private uni was a waste since I was enrolled in Cybersecurity specific courses. 

I was originally going to transfer to a state school in Fall 2021, however things went south with my mother at home. 

As a result, I packed as much as I could and went to stay with a friend while I waited for approval to enter Canada to live with my boyfriend and his family to attend a university there. Big life change. 

I was admitted to the local university here as an international student under general studies for Fall 2021. Once again I took general courses to fulfill general requirements- but unfortunately I fell into a terrible state of mental health and I barely passed so my GPA most likely dropped. I know it's still above a 3.0 at the moment, but its killing me inside that I don't have a 4.0 ( I was a straight A honors student in high school with high test scores and I was in the top 1% of my class. ) 

To provide some context, my mother was very hard on me with grades and just being the golden child as a whole. I would study nonstop and keep straight A's at the expense of my sanity. I am no longer in that environment but I still feel the pressure that I have to know what I want to do for the rest of my life. I had little to no parental presence or advice age 10+. 

I feel anxious and lost. I don't want to spend more time in university than needed but I know I am heading down that path because I keep changing my mind on what I want to do with myself. 

I have picked up a love for baking and I always loved working in cafes so I could finish a degree and go for that, but I fear the backlash from the people around me. I'm more than happy with working with coffee and maybe even opening a side business with delivering homemade baked goods. Cons however is that its customer service, and a decently low salary to pay off student debt. 

However, I love writing and am looking at entering the narrative writing sides of the video game industry. I've loved English since I was younger and always excelled in subjects with the Arts. Same cons as just working in a cafe though. There isn't a lot of money in this field either. 

The bigger two, yet rather nearly impossible options, are Nursing and/or Psychiatry. I was always inspired by the medical field despite struggling with math and science and I wanted to make a difference for those considered ""mentally ill"" or just helping people in the hospitals. However I don't believe I have the GPA anymore for medical school, and also due to Canadas education system being a little bit different than the states, Id have to spend extra time ""retaking"" some high school science courses. While I'd spend extra time in school, the payoff would be tremendous.. and so would the debt lol. But I would get to help people and make a difference for those who never had the help... like myself. 

In summary, I am looking at the following as career choices:
- Cafe worker
- Narrative Writer
- Psychiatrist
- Nurse 

I keep getting torn in all directions. And I can't just drop out of school since my studies are the main thing keeping me in Canada since I am not a citizen, and I also want to get a degree. I want this achievement for myself for all the hells I've been through. 

I just don't know where to start. I don't know what to do. I have an amazing support system now and my boyfriend is being so patient and sweet. I never had this support. The people around me are so sweet and telling me that its ok for me to take time to figure this out, but I want to figure this out for myself. I am entering Year 3 of university and I don't want to be here forever. And I want a career I'll be happy with.

I was considering majoring in something in the school of science. Like biochemistry or environmental science. However I'm concerned about future career prospects, pay, or even if ill enjoy work in those fields.

I also thought about majoring in some type of engineering because of the well paid engineering jobs out there and the general job security that can come from this degree. But on the other hand I've never really had an interest in engineering, and I'm taking physics this year which I really am struggling with and frankly not interested in. And as physics is a large foundation for engineering I don't know if that's a good idea to study.

I also struggle with the fact that I really wouldn't be happy doing a job that's spent in an office all day. I have to move around with my job. Ideally outside or doing something more hands-on.

Starting with 2021 I know I will keep myself above those minimums, but my past is haunting me today.  

How long back will exceptions be made for these two SAP factors?
I made many mistakes in the past regarding my education, but last year I made a commitment to earn a degree I've always wanted.

During a time span from 1989 to 2008, I've accumulated a total of 54 credit hours of classes I've either dropped from or received an E in. I only looked into this total because of the recent finding. On my current unofficial transcript, it shows a total of 32 hours completed and 32 hours attempted. All but 3 of those credits are from 2021. I figured I was set on a path to achieving my goals. it shows 0 attempted credit hours next to all those previous DR

This past year, starting in Jan of 2021, I made a commitment to earn a bachelor's in Computer Science, my lifelong desire. I was ineligible for SAP due to the low GPA when I registered. Starting 2021 with a GPA of 0.5

I've replaced all of those classes I received an E in, over the three semesters this year(2021) and have taken a few other classes on the Computer Science Associate's degree program.

This fall semester was great. I was at 2.00 GPA exactly; the minimum required for FASFA loans. I also work 30 hours per week to pay the bills, but these loans are key to my education and success. I was so happy. This fall semester I received an A+, A, A-, and B+ in the four classes I took. Having the peace of mind of financial aid helped greatly this fall with no financial anxiety, and the ability to take a full-time course load. In 2021, I completed all 33 credit hours I enrolled in this past year, and my GPA is now 3.41

Horray I thought, I'm set on the path to complete the associates here and then transfer to a university for a bachelor's degree in computer science.

Well, yesterday I was overlooking my schedule for the upcoming semester, registering for a class/time I was on a waiting list for which opened for me. Then I clicked on my Financial Aid section. I saw that dreaded red line again. Your SAP status has a UATTHR status and may be at risk of losing financial aid. Please contact the FinAid office for assistance. The financial aid page at my CC shows: Date reviewed 12/22. I received no call or email about that review, I just noticed it when looking at my CC's finAid page.

The Happy holiday's mood following Christmas with family took a devastating turn. Total amount due: $3200. Noooo, I can't. I work 30 hours (3 days) per week, my job is great because it allows school accommodations to a 30hour work week while attending college and keeping full-time benefits/insurance, but that income helps pay my current bills.

I'm surprised they did not mention these issues when I was accepted and given FASFA loans for this recently completed semester in the fall, the only issue mentioned then was my GPA needed to stay above 2.01, which it is. Now what I see is that I will never be able to recover from the mistakes I made 15-32 years ago. I'll never be able to keep my total attempted credit hours under 150%, and I'll never be able to get my completion above 66.67% if those previous DR's(drops) and E's totaling 54 credit hours stay with me at this CC.

I tried searching and reading on the federal FASFA page for SAP and didn't see any limits on how far they go back for these factors. I changed my program from general to computer science this year, and I see the current SAP policy went into effect in 2011, but I'm at a loss right now until I can hear an answer from my CC's financial aid office.

I already emailed the FinAid office at my CC, but they are on break until Jan 3rd. I'm wondering if anyone has been through a similar situation or if someone knows if this can be accepted due to how much time has passed from those previous attempts.

I could have gone to two other schools which were significantly bigger, my friends went their and their rules weren't as strict. But I decided to chose the one I'm in now because of the reason above and also I wanted to get further away from my home town. 
And let's just say there is a big part of me that regrets it.

Don't get me wrong, I've made a lot of friends and the team that I'm on now is one of the best in the nation but other than that, that's about it. Again it's a Christian school so I expected there to be more rules set in place but some of the rules are absolutely ridiculous. First let me just say this. There are two types of people that go to this school. Athletes or Hardcore Christians (HC). There was no mixture. But what really is the kicker is that the number of athletes compared to the HC was significantly higher. The dorm I stay at is pretty much where the boy athletes stay and let's just say if there wasn't these ridiculous rules in place then that place would be burnt to the ground. 

But of course it can't happen because of the rules in place. (BTW the size of the college is about 1,800 undergrads). These rules are some of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard that the other Christian school I debated on going to didn't even have these rules. The one that is legit reasonable is the zero alcohol and drug policy. Is it bullshit, yeah but I sorta get it. It's illegal. And if you get caught you get a contract. You can't even have empty bottles in there which kinda ridiculous but I can kinda see why thats in place. Now that is the only rule that is some what normal. Now let's get into the bullshit.

Non gender mixed dorms: this really has pretty much been abandoned by almost every college and even Christian college for a long time now. Boys and girls have two different dorm buildings. And they are on the complete opposite side of campus from eachother. And what really sends people over the edge is that there are open hall hours which means you had to be out of the opposite genders dorm halls by 10 p.m. on week days or else you get a fine and a contract. It really sucks because college is where you meet new people and start making friend groups but it's almost impossible with these open hours. Even on weekends they kick you out. But what really sucks is that if you have someone of the opposite sex in your room you have to put a coat hanger on the door knop and keep the door open so private time is completely out the window. Even if they are just a friend it still sucks that all the privacy is all but gone. And when closing hours come up, there is always a herd of RA's that roam the halls with their flashlights going into people's room that have a coat hanger to tell them that is almost time. Wouldn't be a big deal... if they bothered to knock. And if they would quit rushing us. I had a girl over just to watch a few movies with and when there was 5 minutes left the RA's just kept on bombarding my door with knocks pretty much giving me a count down to when she had to leave. And when she was leaving I go over to look to my left and there are like 4 RA's standing at the end of the hallway with their flasights just staring at us and making sure she leaves. And even when they clearly saw her with her jacket on walking away from the door they kept on telling her she had to leave. 

Chapel: this one just blows my mind. My school has chapel credits that you have to meet the required amount by the end of the semester. And before you say ""just go to chapel it ain't they hard"", let me just say this... no one likes going to chapel. The messages are complete bogus that even the HC get sick of it. There will be one or two speakers per semester that people actually enjoy but other than that it's awful. And if you don't meet the required amount then you must  pay $25 per credit you missed, write a 3 page long essay explaining why you missed chapel and how it is a sin, and they hit you with a final warning. Meaning if you miss the required amount of credits again then you must not only do the same things listed above but also you automatically fail the semester, no matter what your grades are, and you are suspended from school for 1 semester. 

Ball and chain: you get zero privacy. Not even in your car because they always have campus security driving around making sure no one is doing anything. And you can say ""just go off campus"". Trust me I would but this is a Christian town. They are just as worse with the cops. They always follow you around and never give you any privacy. 

They take religion too seriously: don't get me wrong I've been a Christian since birth but they just use it for everything. I had a friend who was going through depression and when he went to seek help from school employees they just kept saying the same thing "" we'll pray for you"". That's it. They didn't give him extensions on anything or seek help. And when he failed out they kept lecturing him how it was his fault and that God will be with him when he thinks about what he's done when he got academically suspended.

What sucks about this whole thing is that the school glorifies that it is a great Christian school filled with faith when really its just miserable people sick and tired of the people in charge of the place. 

But what I find funny and infuriating at the same time is that if there wasn't all these bogus rules set in place then this would be a great school. We have the people and the personality to do it. My dorm is already pretty much like a frat house with the hidden alcohol and drugs, just with all the bull shit rules in place. College would be a lot more fun cause I see all my friends going to the schools that I was debating on going to having the time of their lives while at the same time me and my friends are sitting on the couch having nothing to do because of the rules set it place. I get licks of what college should be like here in there when I visit my friends sometimes on weekends and I always have fun. I even was shocked when I went to my friends dorm room and his RA was casually drinking a beer with his roomate in the halls. (He also goes to a private Christian school so that just screams bullshit) people at my school do the same thing at their friends colleges. But all of us could only imagine what it would be like to have that luxury at our school. While instead of casually drinking in the dorm rooms not having a care in the world and having friends over no matter their sex is at anytime. But instead I get raided by the RA's because they ""smelled beer"" coming from my room. Now did I have alcohol, yeah why wouldn't I. But I never opened a single bottle and I didn't have any beer in my room. The next week while everyone was at practice they raided all  our rooms, and ignored our privacy. And let's just say there was a lot of contracts and suspensions that were handed out. Hell just last year when one of the players on the football team was handing out L's left and right to the other team the RA's raided his room and found alcohol. They had no reason to do that. He never caused trouble, got along with everyone and he hardly drank in his room. They did it just because they could. 

I'm honestly debating on switching schools at this point cause this past semester just angered me to witness my high school friends at their colleges taking shots with the fucking RA at a tailgating party when we got an email during our homecoming week that alcohol was not allowed at all at the tailgate and that there would be cops patrolling the event with breathalyzers in hand. And God forbid they did find alcohol. They pretty much searched the entire campus when they found ONE busch can laying on tbe ground at the event. But turns out it was one of the football players who shot gunned it and just set it on the ground outside the stadium just to piss off the Dean. They searched my dorm hall during the game because it shares the same parking lot as the stadium. Did they tell us? No. Did the invade our privacy over one beer can? Yeah.

125,Embarrassed-Dig-0,1640329797,/r/college/comments/rngpnt/failing_out_of_community_college/,"I failed this particular math class 3 times. And failed another class. My major is STEM but really I just want a degree to graduate so I am willing to change it if they (understandably) won't let me take it again.

I fucked up and its my responsibility. For some background info the first time I failed a family member started choking another family member during arguments and my parent got into several drunk driving accidents and went missing for one week. Out of stress I literally just gave up, which is TOTALLY on me.

In terms of the other 2 times, I was recently diagnosed bipolar. However I've had episodes since I was 17 and was too afraid to seek medicine after some bad experiences in high school. Basically during the bad episodes I will either get extremely depressed (suicidal) or stop sleeping for 2 months and get delusional - this semester I thought people were on my roof, that people were plotting against me, etc. So yeah I failed this semester given that I stopped sleeping and went a little crazy.

Anyways let me just acknowledge its TOTALLY on me. I have these issues but at the end of the day I know its MY responsibility to put school ahead of my personal issues.

Here's the dilemma. I was recently put on bipolar medication, and reached the starting therapeutic dose in the last two weeks of the semester. Since that dose increase, my life has literally changed. Like I can't remember feeling this way because of how shrouded my life has been with mental illness. I feel exponentially better than I have in YEARS.

That's great and all but I already fucked up so idk what to do. **my financial aid office said that FASFA will cover my class no matter how many times I failed it** but I know its more about the fact that I'm doing STEM, and that its that one class.

Idk what to do.... I want to continue school SO badly and am willing to pay out of my own pocket to re take that class. I also feel SO MUCH BETTER after I finally reached the starting therapeutic dose (they have to slowly titrate you up to avoid a deadly reaction to the medicine).

In terms about what would be different if I continued school, its **literally just the fact that I'm back on medicine**, and a medicine that's working. I haven't been on any medicines since I was 17 (I stopped taking them and thought it was my spiritual destiny to die/that I was being hunted)

Also I was a part time student so its not like I failed 4 classes this seamster. But yeah, I don't even know if my school will let me continue given how many classes I've failed. Last time I spoke to a counselor last semester he was very rude. One of the comments he said was ""Well... you must have at least one brain cell since you passed x class"".

Do you think I should just give up on college? I know it might be too late, its 100% my fault that I did not get back on medicine sooner.

That being said, when should I ask professors for letters of recommendation?

Would it be appropriate to ask these professors for letters of recommendations (fully explaining the situation) and hold on to them until I apply for grad school?

So I started in a teaching program for social studies after having just earned my bachelors in history, this was 5 years ago, and I don't mind adding the school name which is the MAT program at Valdosta State University in Georgia. I will add I loved my time as a history student and missed my professors when I graduated, but the teaching program setup was crap. Not setup well if you aren't living with your parents still because they do not leave you time to work if you live on your own, I actually had a roommate also in it. The lesson plans you had to submit as a student teacher was anywhere from 3 to 5 pages per lesson, that is for one subject, times 5 a week, and had to submit to your assigned teacher two days before it was taught. So that's at least about 20 pages a week for one subject. If you are put with a teacher who has multiple subjects like I did eventually thats about 60 pages of lesson plans a week. On top of having classes we still had to attend on campus with separate work. The teacher I was placed with was grandfathered in before you had to have a teaching masters and her degree was a simple teaching degree. Nothing wrong with that except I was way more experienced in history than this high school social studies teacher. She mostly taught U.S. history and was given World History and Economics the year I was assigned to her. She needed my help with World History since she never taught it and I tried with Economics but wasn't my subject area. The funny thing is eventually you are expected to fully take over teaching all subjects your last semester. So parents are sending their kids to learn from a student teacher who has no background in Economics and not to mention the paid teacher who also didn't, but thats just how schools randomly assign teachers sometimes. On top of the fact we also had to do EDTPA as our main course assignment for student teaching which included an extra $300 out of pocket submission cost. Funny enough I did get that far and received a score higher than some friends in the program. But at the end I was fed up with the schedule which was more brutal than the paid teachers while trying to keep a part time job to help pay with my roommate. I made the comment of worry about how they schedule the program to the main field work faculty member, can't remember her name but this was 2016-2017 so if anyone is familiar of it maybe they know, but her advice was either borrow from family, go in debt and repay later on a teachers salary I guess, or quit the program and retry when financially better. After that I realized it wasn't worth it and seeing from the inside the mental fatigue I would endure as a teacher today, I left the program, went and got my library science masters degree added on and started out making more as a reference librarian at a university since I had experience working as a supervisor in a university library already while working on the library science masters, than I would as a teacher in a public school. I've never once woken up regretting going into work and love working with college students. So moral of the story is if you are entering a teaching program, or any program, and it sounds or feels as bad as my experience was telling me, you can always pivot and be happier you did like I am. Hate that the average teacher now only lasts about 3 years before leaving teaching from what I've read, but after my experience in that program I am not surprised. That program wasn't creating teachers but just classroom managers. Maybe they changed since then, hope they finally put those courses on campus online to help alleviate the schedule. But while I had to spend an extra year for the library program, in the end one year was worth for a career I love and make more with, rather than wake up unhappy in a different one because I didn't think I could change my course outline.

Before I get the ""just keep going"" comments, my mental health in college has always been bad. But I can't afford therapy.  My family won't help me without controlling (or trying to through guilting me) who I see for a therapist (they would have to fit a bunch of requirements just for my parents let alone me). This semester I could almost never get out of bed. I just want it all to be over. I had dreams. But now, I can't even afford the help I need even if I did trust people because no one I know has that kind of money. My university is booked up, and while administrators are frustrated about that because they are supposed to offer services to students, that expansion is.. Well, slow as molasses.

I was trying to build my GPA from what I thought was a bad first semester slowly so I could graduate with a 3.5 in the honors college (I've never gotten all A's) but I had a 3.1 beginning this fall. Now I'm going to have about a 2.5-2.6. I would have to basically get an entire other degree to get a 3.5, let alone any higher... So my first thought was cut things.. I work because I have to pay bills, so I can't cut that. But I can't cut school right now either because my scholarship to go here will be forfeited if I leave (yes, I checked) and I'm at the minimum credit hours for my college degree (16) I don't see how succeeding and graduating is even possible, let alone anything post graduate.

When I was first starting college I was depressed, but I loved the material. At this point I KNOW (like 100%) that it's not a material comprehension issue. In fact, I've probably robbed myself of the opportunity to have comprehension issues because I either haven't learned and I'm just guessing or I've been depressed for so long even if I am smart enough then I'm just not good enough cause my mind goes hopeless quick. I'm not sure. I don't want to be treated differently because my grades are a reflection and snapshot of my mental health basically 24/7, like I don't want to be pitied. I recognize my grades are my responsibility, and school/professors shouldn't feel obligated to help me or let me turn in things late when I can't get out of bed. I need to manage it and do better and be better. That's on me.

But damn.. I'm so tired of waking up and making my reality of grades worse even though I'm trying to get better on my own. I'm trying. I TRIED this semester and now the silent 3.5-3.0 cutoff of grad school even is going away. Has anyone ever come out of this?? I still... Well.. I wanted to pursue my field. I still had passion about it. I know I'm not good enough but I have the attitude. I could do it if I wasn't stuck all the time in my head. But the computer that will kick me out of grad school before I even start does not give a crap about my excuses. 

Sorry for the long post. I need advice on understanding how to graduate from here and if anyone else has had anything similar happen?

130,Woat_The_Drain,1639269885,/r/college/comments/red0eu/american_colleges_are_a_scam_even_for_stem/,"**TL;DR: American colleges prioritize anything else over teaching and do not run a tight ship.** 

**WARNING:** All the examples I give are from the university I went to, but I went to a highly acclaimed American school and I know many people who got a lot less from other ""better"" schools who paid a lot more than I did. It also goes without saying that all of these examples are much worse at most American ""party"" schools where they prioritize teaching and career prep even less, and I know a lot of people who went to these types of schools.

**I know what you're thinking: ""This is some kid who didn't do well and didn't find a job so he is blaming his problems on something else."" Actually, this is further from the truth.** 

**I graduated with an engineering degree with a high GPA and I easily got a good job in my field after graduation. I am satisfied with my life at this point.** I definitely learned a lot in college, but I can't help think that I could have learned a lot of this on my own without spending 10s of thousands of dollars or at least what I got out of college was not worth the price. Even with an academic scholarship for 50% off tuition, I still paid a ton of money. I was really funny to see that athletes got priority in an institution that was supposed to be about learning. I actually almost became a starter on one of our best varsity teams since I was recruited, but I figured it would be a waste of time since I don't want to spend 4 years playing sports instead of learning. Athletes had the same scholarship I did, but with a 0.5 point lower GPA requirement and with preferential treatment in course scheduling. I get that athletes need to get priority to schedule things around practices and games, but this just proves that American colleges prioritize sports over actual learning.

I used to be a college advocate because people in my industry frequently told me that they prefer college graduates over self-taught people because in college you learn the meaning behind all the principles that you are taught and you could therefore be creative and extrapolate them to engineering new things. Despite this argument, I kept noticing that all I need from college are these key explanations, and professional instruction, which is what I got, but I still think the price I got them for is a rip-off. Some of the best professors I ever had agreed with me. In class they would say ""Tuition is ridiculously expensive and the price that you guys pay per hour to be here is unjustified so it's in your best interest to pay attention.""

I think that this is caused by colleges falling prey to chasing profits. **There is nothing wrong with chasing profits since it is a great incentive structure to make your product better, unless it causes your product to get worse...**

American colleges nowadays prioritize selling ""The College Experience"" over learning and being tough. They love to raise tuition so that they can pour millions into sports facilities, professors' research that sometimes isn't very useful, and random events that totally overpower the actual objective of being there: actually learning. I loved the ""College Experience."" Partying and having fun with friends and going to events and being able to discipline myself as an adolescent to get my life together was great...but I can do all of that without paying tens of thousands of dollars. Unfortunately this has created a perverse incentive structure where student ""happiness"" is prioritized over learning. Colleges will get more student satisfaction and good reviews if they make their classes easy, super informal, and have the professors bow down to the students. American adolescents love this type of stuff since they are immature and have been sold this type of lifestyle. And I don't blame them. Why would you go to a school with hard classes and strict professors, when you can get the same degree from a school with a similar ranking/reputation with easy classes and pushover professors?

I went to a pretty good engineering school, but I would not send my future children there. At least, I would not give the school any of my money. There was so much blatant cheating, professors that changed grading schemes and gave extreme curves because we were so lazy, and students would show up to class late and in pajamas just to play on their phone the whole time while their parents were paying dozens of their hard earned dollars per hour for their kids to be there. 

So many of my classes were easy A's because the professors were basically afraid of upsetting the students. And I remember so many classmates prioritizing taking a ton of easy freshman-level classes as electives over actually practical ones just so that they could get their degree with no effort. I despised this. I thought ""You were blessed enough to be born in the U.S. into a middle-upper class family and have your parents pay for your degree and you have the audacity to sign up to learn nothing in these easy classes just so you can get the participation award."" Each year we had a credit limit of 20 per semester and any credit amount over 12 credits was just charged as a one-time ""Full Time"" tuition, so someone taking 12 credits would pay the same as someone taking 20 credits. I made it a point to take 18-20 credits EVERY SEMESTER of my college years, except my last semester when I took 16 credits of Graduate-Level courses and focused on my job search. I was paying them money and I was going to get my money's work

Not all bad classes had bad professors. Many of my professors were geniuses who had a lot of good stuff to say, but they were not held accountable for their class not being worth the money. I thought it was disgusting that these smart men and women had the worst organization skills that I have ever seen. We used the ""Canvas"" software that most schools use and these professors had no clue how to use it. They would also forget to upload essential material that they said they would, spent the entire semester grading assignments that were due in the first week of class, changed the rules of the course as they went, and were disorganized in general. I had a professor who never used slides or prepared material. This was a highly technical, mathematical, and logical class. He just had a list of topics to cover per lecture and he would actively write out the lesson as he went. His verbal explanations were better than any supplemental material and he taught us deep explanations as to why these mathematical structures operated as they did. The problem was that he wrote everything in a Google Doc in Arial font, including diagrams written on the fly in Google Drawings with a laptop trackpad . Thus, looking back on the notes was effectively useless. He also made new rules on the fly like ""pop quiz every week to encourage you guys to study"" that only happened twice before he forgot about it. He also barely wrote essential planning info down like test dates or test info. Now, you may think: ""OP, you are complaining about college being too easy, but get mad when the prof doesn't spoon feed you the info."" I'm not mad that he didn't spoon feed the info and wrote everything during class, like how college used to be (which is cool). I am mad about his lack or organization and me spending much of my time dedicated to that class trying to guess what would happen next. I learned a lot of essential info from the two classes that I took with that professor, but they could have been perfect if his organizational skills weren't abysmal. He did have two very smart TAs but they were effectively useless. Why you may ask? Because we barely got homework. We got 4 very large homework assignments throughout the whole semester even though he promised 12+. This sounds like a simple class structure difference, but most college students don't learn well like that. The best classes had mandatory small and frequent assignments that led up to the large projects so that we would get constant practice and have a reason to got to the TAs for more info and help. But, when you make the homework assignment very infrequent (or make homework optional, as other classes did), you create an incentive structure where students will prioritize homework from other classes over your own. **Disclaimer: There is nothing wrong with students being held accountable for motivating themselves to study often and put in work, but if you are charging obscene amounts of money you cannot ignore the basic psychological fact that adolescents are more likely to learn if you give them mandatory constant practice that is, each time, a little harder than their current abilities.**

I did have a few great classes with great professors. ALL of my favorite classes involved the professor coming in on the first day and saying something along the lines of: **""If you are not here to learn, get out so you don't disrupt my lecture. I know a lot more about the world than you do so do not even try the BS that most college students do when they refuse to do work or beg for better grades. I don't care what grade you get and if you fail, you fail, but I just care that you learn a lot.""** I would pay good money to have my future children to take these classes. The professors cared and were not afraid to subordinate students' happiness to actually learning. They taught practical skills and were very aware that college was a rip off. 

**How to make College Classes Worth the Money:**

1. **Make sure the info is relevant and taught well.**
2. **Have constant practice with progressive overload via assignments and quizzes as well as frequent professor attention.**
3. **Hold the professor accountable for not doing his/her job or being too disorganized**.
4. **MAKE ASSIGNMENTS AND ATTENDANCE MANDATORY.** (It makes me sick to my stomach when a class has optional attendance and homework because only and idiot would believe that a bunch of 18-22 year-olds would prioritize that work over anything else).
5. **Cut the inflated salaries of college administrators and PRIORITIZE learning from industry and research professionals over having fun for 4-5 years.** (We would get emails every day about what cool fun events are happening on campus, but barely any on essential info to get jobs and known paths to success via hard work. I don't care about the new $10 million rec center full of random things that the school just built. I am here to learn and set myself up for a great career.)
6. **Don't let students run the show.** Teenagers and young adults are notoriously bad at discipline and everyone on Earth knows that college-aged young adults make impulsive and self-gratifying decisions while thinking about the short term. With this, you will greatly increase the chances of success of students.
7. **If you are a student, think about whether you need to go to college right now.** Maybe it isn't the best idea to get a degree in philosophy right out of high school just to have fun and blame everyone except yourself when you aren't a millionaire in 4 years. Set yourself up financially by getting a more practical degree or entering the job force and ensure stability. **Once you are stable and happy with your life, go back and get that philosophy degree** so you can put in your effort since you're more mature and don't worry about becoming poor. **If you are passionate about the ""less practical"" or non-STEM subjects, they are totally worth studying in a professional context...just not right out of high school by someone who knows nothing about the world and has no stability in his/her life.**

My favorite class in college was a class outside of my major but it had an excellent professor, practical info, and great structure. The professor did not have the most advanced degrees like other professors did, but he DAMN well knew how to run a class. We had lectures during the week where he would present like a professional public speaker and teach us only the most relevant information. Then we would have assignments each week based on that week's lecture that were slightly more advanced than our current abilities so we were challenged, but in a way that made us want to struggle and put in effort. The content of each assignment was always very relevant and I maintain those skills to this day. He came in on Day 1 and laid out the grading scheme and said that if anyone disagreed or thinks they can manipulate him instead of putting in the work, they can walk out right then and there. He kept his promise. I failed several assignments because they were hard, but I DIDN'T care. I learned a ton of info from the class and he made it clear that the assignments were challenging and that since we had a week to do them and TAs as a resource, all grades were final. I almost forgot to mention the TAs. The only people he allowed to be TAs were former students who previously earned a 95+% in his course and he treated them very well, so they were incentivized to do a great job. **This man earned my money and my respect.**

It was really sad to see that the students that got high-paying jobs at FAANG (now MAANG) companies or high-level engineering positions had GPAs in the low 2.0 range. They had initiative, drive, skills, and the ability to delay self-gratification. **They were only there to get the degree since most high-level jobs required one.** **This racket made them spend tens of thousands of dollars for no reason.** I also knew a lot of them and they were extremely smart. Not academic smart or ""book smart,"" but their problem solving skills and logical abilities were insane. They easily could have gotten 4.0s, but why waste their time, when they could learn a lot more on their own? These people easily had 140+ IQs and they all tried to get high-level jobs that didn't require a degree out of high school and they worked their asses off outside of school.

Most of the high-level skills that got me a good job were self-taught. :(

I really hope that there is some sort of shift from high-level jobs requiring degrees. Once that happens, colleges will be forced to make students get their money's worth in learning and the people that truly deserve those jobs will be motivated to get their money's worth or not to go to college at all. The modern American college system is a racket and they are not even hiding it.

**I, however, am hopeful. I go on job recruiting websites and see the GPA requirements getting lower and lower or even with a degree being optional. GOOD JOB. Hire people based purely on their skills and abilities, and not whether or not they spent a bunch of money to get a fancy title next to their name.**",college,"American Colleges are a Scam, even for STEM Degrees.

I now work in an office and it's been a tough transition amonog my fellow peers and I (Those I graudated with.)

1. We all work at different companies but all of our companies, we find ourselves actually working overtime most days. Instead of a 40 hour week, it looks more like 45-50 hours salaried (No overtime pay). We are all stressed.
2. I have struggled with ADHD most of my life but in the school system I found people were forgiving with feedback and little mistakes not so much in design post-graduation
3. I'm 4 months in and the senior designer training me is suddenly gone-we don't know when he is coming back to the office. There are days where I really don't know the answers to questions
4. In school I always made the deadlines on time and was punctual with my work, even in team and large scale event projects, and at my internship. But now at my job 2-4 people are always in my files and deadlines get complicated with sudden changes and late feedback.
5. I feel like my physical and mental health are not doing their greatest. It's like a slow burn.
6. Getting used to office lingo and business culture is really strange. People are indirect and sometimes I'm not sure if I understand them fully.
7. My mom and family always sticked to one job, one place of work their whole life- that's because in the school system their pay was based off of the years they worked there, not completely tied to performance, I feel so stressed at my new place of work and always feel the need to step up and say yes to working overtime even when I know I shouldn't for that hope at a raise
8. Most of my circle are in the same situation I'm in but for even less benefits and pay.

I need someone to genuinely take in all of this information and choose for me because I can't choose for myself. Here's a bunch of relevant information:

\- I'll be graduating in August with a low gpa of 2.7 or somewhere around there (due to MDD and medication changes through my college career)

\- My grandmother and aunt paid for a $700 LSAT prep course and I have a fee waiver from the law school admission council so I don't have to pay for two of the LSATs as well as some other stuff

\- I'm registered to take the LSAT in January which means I'll have to study super hard over the break which I'll be spending alone in my apartment anyways

\- Besides law school, I'm considering getting my master's in library sciences to go into archiving and curating or going to the UK to get my master's in history or museum studies

\- The field of library science is incredibly competitive and oversaturated since there are so few museums and libraries so I'm not sure I'd be able to get a job even with a master's

\- I'm currently holding out for an on-campus archival assistant job that'll start in January (the man who interview emailed me saying I didn't get the position but that he wants to hire me but he's holding out for more money from the university so he can hire two students instead of one)

\- The master's program options for the UK are limited due to my low gpa

\- Disregarding this post, I'm actually really good at writing and reading comprehension

\- I've been homeless, my mother is a meth addict, and so are two out of three of my brothers, so I have experience with having a rough background and I feel like I can utilize that if I go to law school and go into public policy

\- I don't drive nor do I ever plan to so I need to live in a city or country with good public transportation

\- For law school, I'm looking at Yeshiva Cardozo in NYC and UC Hastings in San Fran

\- For MLS, I've been looking at CUNY Queens College in NYC

134,newclassic360,1638253105,/r/college/comments/r5go1q/what_is_the_future_of_university_and_college/,"Hey guys, 

I'm currently taking a break from university, with no concrete plans of returning for a couple reasons. Recently I noticed the rise and appeal of coding bootcamps/online courses to learn specific skills. Trade school has also been coming back as more of a cost effective and viable option for those who are unsure of what major to pursue.  

There are a couple reasons why I think the future of university might look a bit different. 

For example: 

1) Cost of university/college is still insanely expensive, as well as student debt in the U.S. is a big financial burden for recent grads. 

2) A lot of tech companies such as Google and Amazon are offering courses for people who are willing to learn tech skills and earn certificates. Although there are caveats with these types of programs I'm sure. I think Amazon requires you to work for them once you complete the program. 

3) The job market is more saturated with recent grads. A college degree's value has diminished now that most people have them. Decent-paying jobs also require a lot of experience, but most recent grads don't have the experience or qualifications that those employers are asking for. Not to mention, entry-level jobs don't pay enough for students to pay off their student debt within a reasonable amount of time. 

4) This one is more of a personal observation, but I've noticed that students who go into college without a strong sense of knowing what path or career they want to pursue after often feel depressed and unmotivated to complete their coursework. Most of my friends are still in university either in undergrad or doing a graduate program. From their anecdotes, they seem miserable. Most of them dread it and can't wait for their school breaks. A lot of them are often stressed out of their minds and struggle maintaining a healthy lifestyle while attending university. This is also why I'm hesitant to go back to school, since it seems like I might end up in the same boat as they are. 

So I think my question is, what do you guys think the future of university/college will look like? Will more students decide that university isn't what they wanna pursue after high school?",college,What is the future of university and college?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/r5go1q/what_is_the_future_of_university_and_college/,1638271105.0
135,m48_apocalypse,1637110389,/r/college/comments/qvmx6m/just_got_a_job_and_im_falling_behind_in_school/,"TL;DR Got a pretty demanding job because of better pay and now I'm falling behind in my classes. Just talked to my doctor about ADHD/anxiety/insomnia treatments since I suspect those 3 things might be the main culprit of my poor time management. Any advice on how to manage my time well/organise my activities until I hear back about the test results/treatment?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently taking about 13-14 credit hours at the moment. Recently, I decided to take a job as a pharmacy technician since it paid pretty well. However, it was pretty demanding (it was like taking another class, and I had to go through countless hours of online training before working in the actual pharmacy, which I found to be even more demanding than the online portion.

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to my doctor about getting tested for anxiety and ADHD today, as well as sleep medication, since I have trouble staying asleep (I also go to bed pretty late, around 3-6AM most nights). Everything's been pretty overwhelming, so every time I start panicking about things, I'll usually hide somewhere and play games/watch something until I calm down, but by the time that's over, I'll be too tired to do anything. When I'm in the mood to work, I also have a tendency to organise everything poorly, since I jump between tasks that come to mind, as well as hyperfocusing on one thing and forgetting about everything else as a result. The hyperfocusing thing I've been doing with my job, so I completely forget about school until I see something that reminds me of my assignment.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried using a planner, and it's decently helpful, but only if I 1) actually remember to use it and follow it and 2) don't avoid it in fear of looking at the stuff and realising I'm behind.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I've found that I do pretty well in classes that are completely in-person, or classes that are completely online and self-paced within a certain deadline. Virtual/blended classes, however, are a nightmare, since they involve Zoom meetings and I can't take them seriously for some reason. I usually get distracted for the entire duration (unless I hear something interesting), and those Zoom meetings contain the bulk of the class' lectures. I guess Zoom is just...really not engaging for some reason, it's more easy for things to go in one ear and out the other.

&amp;#x200B;

Stats and Calc, I'm doing great in (completely online and self-paced within a deadline period), and English/Comp is also going really well (completely in-person). I'm pretty sure I'm failing Bio (blended) even though I do decently in labs (in-person), because most of the content is from Zoom and I end up not being able to retain any info, even if I try to take notes.

&amp;#x200B;

136,ViperOnThatBeat,1637004411,/r/college/comments/quo8t4/should_i_drop_out_of_college_and_redirect_my_own/,"Paying for college while broke in unusual circumstances is pushing me to drop out.

I am a college student attending a public film school. I like being here. Unfortunately I--a 2020 high school graduate--was retarted enough to jump right into university ASAP. During a pandemic. Where I felt like shit and have continued to feel like shit for three semesters straight. I love being creative, doing creative work. It brings me purpose for this world. I, however, hate feeling like shit when all I have done with my day is work and drive, work and drive, with no window of opportunity to enjoy the day, my friends, or my life outside of my own house because I JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FUCKING MONEY.

Here's the fried thing, right? My tuition isn't expensive by normal college standards. It's like $5.5K a semester. I have a merit scholarship that cuts it to $2.7K a semester. Here's the problem though: My step-father, who's a well-paid doctor, is refusing to pay for my education simply because in his own words ""I am not your father"". Mind you he pays for many other expenses like matinence in the wonderful house we live in and car repairs. He's easily making six figure income and jacks my EFC up for FAFSA. Oh well that fucking sucks, at least my mother might help right? No, it's not a given. Half of her time is spent being grandma and grandpa's legal guardian because they had a big mental health can of worms spill out and it's still being cleaned up. She's only able to work temp since the temple she worked at cut her off during the pandemic. Now she and I would have to scrape our savings to pay $2.7K. $2.7K!!! That's fucking ridiculous we have to pay scraps while she can only work temp and I'm dealing with full time college. I have about $1.3K and she prolly has a little over that. I don't know, she's not transparent on her end of this financial deal 😡.

So I'm thinking of dropping out, or taking a gap  year. Or two. Or many, because I just DON'T HAVE MONEY. Or *ENOUGH* MONEY. Trust me, I would love to hone my craft at my school until completion and earn my BFA. But honestly? I can't work and study at the same time, because even with one (1) (ONE!) editing comission I am taking MONTHS to complete. That and if I'm struggling with one comission I can't do school on top. School is a 37-45 hr week job. Adding a job on top will make me insane. I have friends that work in college or multiple jobs. They claim to be okay. They're bullshitting because their mental health is doodoo and I'm already medicated for current problems AS-IS by being a full time college student. Second, I don't have friends in college. Many friends rather, because three semesters during a pandemic and being poor in a rich man's house doesn't provide much opportunity for campus engagement :))))))) so that's been down the drain and I've felt like poop. 

So now I'm thinking about going back to square one. Get done with this semester, not make any college plans for the spring, and straight up see a career counselor, because if I go down this path of scraping for dollars for college with my mother, it'll end up terrible for both of us, our relationship will go to shit, and I will be left only with tools and a piece of paper in a grown-up world where I still have the emotional and directional discipline of a teenager. I won't be able to survive on my own after graduation. I'm constantly insecure that my direction in life isn't 100% my own and I fucking hate myself for that.

So what'll it be, should I press on with my studies unsure of how to pay? Or should I drop out now and stack some paper before I make any further decision? Or could I just scrape whatever I have and spend on alternative education solutions? I don't wanna call warm and hotlines over this shit anymore.",college,Should I drop out of college and redirect my own life because I can't guarantee paying for tuition?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/quo8t4/should_i_drop_out_of_college_and_redirect_my_own/,1637022411.0

I grew up very low-income and only got to go to this college because they provide full financial aid. People say colleges like this are the \~great equalizer\~ or whatever. Because they give enough financial aid that low-income people can go, we're supposed to be able to break the cycle of poverty and all by attending the school.

The problem isn't the school. It's the wealthy kids who attend it. The vast majority of the people who go here are rich. I mean they're more rich than I can even imagine. They never have and never will have to worry about money. They can have whatever they want. I don't care about all that. Let them have expensive clothes and cars. Whatever. The problem is that they treat people who aren't rich like outsiders. They create whole systems to prevent us from interacting with them and getting the most out of college. At my school there are social clubs. To even try to get in, they make you pay so much money that low-income kids are completely barred from them. They hold these fancy parties that we can't go to because we weren't born to doctors and investors like they were. If the problem ended there, maybe I'd get over it. But it goes on.

You can't make it without a degree financially in this stage of failing capitalism, I see teachers in my classes all the time going on break and you're supposed to worship them like they're a hero when in reality a lot of them don't give a fuck if you're on the brink of suicide because of their rigid ways either pay them more so you're not a McDonald's worker or fucking kill yourself

I honestly miss high school and the ability to just have someone present the stuff without making it feel like a low effort youtube video, that I happen to pay a lot of money for. Thankfully there is one class this semester that is in-person and it just feels amazing, I'm paying attention, I'm asking questions, and I don't walk out feeling like the information just entered one ear and exited through the other.

I'm 19 and in my junior year of college. I'm in my college's business school, after having transferred internally at the end of my last semester. I was previously studying French, and that was exciting to me. But French doesn't pay the bills, and I'm a first-generation American with no wealth to rely upon as a cushion.

My grades are basically perfect, I can't complain there. But my classes just bore the *everliving hell* out of me; it is becoming increasingly harder to get myself to do the work. I still do it, but I don't do it happily. It's a lot of work, but that's not my issue. I enjoy doing work if I find it stimulating, but this class work is easy and mind-numbingly boring. It feels insulting to me.

I also just think that I don't think that I want to *do* business for the rest of my life. The concept fills me with dread: five days a week, for the rest of my life, making enough money to retire at 60, but still doing something I'd absolutely loathe. I'm a naturally creative person, I speak four languages, I want to spend the rest of my life going around the world and learning languages (I speak 4 languages, and am trying to learn a fifth) or at least do something creative, like writing, videomaking, etc... but that doesn't pay the bills. Ideally, I'd be able to travel the world and just learn languages, but that also does not pay the bills.

My school is also in the middle of bumfuck nowhere; I am somebody who loves city life, because there's so much to do. Everything in the area around my school, however, closes at 2 AM, and everybody goes to the same two or three bars (because there's nowhere else to go), and it's gotten so boring going there too.

I think I might just want to transfer colleges, it's something I've been considering for a long time but never did because I didn't want to make my friends sad, so I chickened out of it at the last moment last semester, when it would've been timely. I have the grades to go to a good one. I could get challenged there and meet some interesting people from other countries, or even from around the US. My college doesn't have that... it's all just people from my state. Transferring though, as a junior, seems so scary to do, because I'd have to take a year off of school, elsewise I'd just be wasting my money taking the very classes I hate. At the same time though, the desire to transfer feels like me just chasing pedigree... I am just genuinely so conflicted.

I am currently a second-year cadet at a state maritime academy in the deck officer program. For those that don't know, basically I go to school to learn how to drive and navigate ships and manage cargo, all the stuff a ship's mate would do. Admittedly, I dicked around a lot in my first year, much more than I should have, and I came out with an abysmal 2.14 GPA for last year. Now, this year, I'm almost halfway through, and I've definitely turned my shit all around. However, the more time I spend here, the more I worry about what if it turns out I don't enjoy this sort of life. As a mariner working on the Great Lakes (which I plan to do), I would most likely be gone 2 months at a time, with one month off in between periods of being out at sea, and then a few months' stretch between mid-January and mid-March. While this only totals to around 6-7 months of work throughout the year, and the prospective pay is pretty good for where I'm headed, part of me is terrified of what if it turns out I don't enjoy the time away. I fully intend on getting married and having a family, and I know being gone for such stretches of time can put strain on my loved ones. Now, I'll be going out on my academy's training ship come summer, and after which I can ensure I'm making the right choice here. However, I like to have a back-up plan in case this doesn't work out for me. Now, my program, while perusing my appropriate licenses, also would give me a bachelor's of science in maritime technology. However, in the back of my mind, I've always had this passion since I was a kid for aircraft, and for the longest time I always wanted to either major in aerospace engineering and/or become a pilot. I thought of going military, but I realized that isn't necessarily a lifestyle for me. 

So, would I still be able to graduate in 4 years if, say after this semester or before next fall, I dropped from the program, took gen ed courses at a community college and did online school part time while pursuing a helicopter pilot's license? The classes I have under my belt already include basic physics as well as trigonometry, and many of my maritime courses do have a heavy emphasis on mathematics. I know a degree can be beneficial even if a pilot isn't required one, and an engineering degree can be a solid fallback to the fallback should becoming a helicopter pilot not work out for whatever reason. I can't imagine taking many science and math based gen ed courses online through community college until I transfer to get an online degree would be a terrible thing, would it? 

Tl,dr: I go to school to be a commercial seaman, should I feel this isn't right for me, would it be financially and time-wise feasible for me to switch from my current 4-year program to finishing gen eds through community college online and pursue an online degree while pursuing a helicopter pilot's license since I also have a love for aviation?",college,Am I screwed if I switch to becoming a pilot instead of sailing?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/q8d7dz/am_i_screwed_if_i_switch_to_becoming_a_pilot/,1634278123.0

You can check out my post history for details, but the TL;DR is that I was abused as a child in a way that precluded me from being a high achiever in high school.  The best school I got accepted into was my safety, UNC, but I wasn't given any scholarships because of my performance.  I had middling ECs, a good test score (35 on the ACT) and a low GPA for the level I was competing at (3.86 UW).

It's made me feel contempt for my college.  I'm surrounded by peers who were given scholarships because the school values them more.  UNC views me as being deserving of becoming a debtor to line their endowment, and nothing more.  But I didn't apply to any less-selective schools that likely would have given me more money.  Likely it was due to my mental health.  I was dealing with a lot of trauma last fall and the isolation from COVID-19 didn't help anything. 

And the worst part is, I can't even transfer out.  I can't undo the $15k I took out for this year, much less get scholarships to transfer to cheaper schools because those are reserved for freshman and just don't exist.  My mental health for the next few months is hinging entirely on me getting enough scholarships to pay for all of school for next year, and then the years after.  And, of course, that's always way harder to do once you've started college.

But in the meantime, I'm miserable.  I'm angry that my school values people who didn't deal with half the shit I did more solely because they had opportunities I didn't.  It's making my mental health even worse, because along with dealing with the trauma from my childhood on its own, I have to live with the knowledge that I'm **still being hurt by it** because of how much debt I'm in.

My only recourse is that maybe by going to UNC, the fact that it's a ""better school"" than any that would have given me financial aid will help me make more money to justify the higher cost.  But that might not even matter because my major is CS.  I don't like being angry, and I don't like holding nothing but contempt for my school, but I also know they think I'm a worthless piece of shit.

*Was referred to this sub from MIT subreddit, don't expect anyone directly from MIT to respond, but literally any general information would be appreciated :D*

&amp;#x200B;

***Financial Aid***

Good chance I'm wrong, but my understanding is MIT doesn't do merit based scholarships for undergrads, but they do give grants based off your family's income and overall how much of the COA you can pay? My family is like dirt broke, literal poverty: **divorced parent makes \~20k yearly**.

Assuming, by a *very* big long-shot, I somehow get accepted, **would I be eligible for a 'full-ride' / like a grant that covers the entire COA**? If not, is there a **general** like **ballpark** on **how much I would expect paying out of pocket**?

Obviously ik this depends on very specific information and my FASPA and whatnot which I can't provide seeing I'm a junior so idk myself, but **literally just any estimate / information** of what to expect would be nice

&amp;#x200B;

***Admissions***

Obviously I know this is also very dependent on specific information and individual cases as well, but I was always dead-set on the University of Florida since it's arguably the best in FL, and based on my overall case, there's essentially no chance of me being denied.

Was selected as a possible candidate for the National Merit Scholarship which would grant a full ride to UF, and this PSAT was fucking brutal. Either way not likely, and after being told I should look into more prestigious institutions, just now started looking into MIT, essentially my dream school

*Essentially, I have no idea what such a university is looking for / if it's achievable in my case. Was hoping for any advice on what to expect / whether my admittance is even realistic.*

**Basic ""student profile""** (?) to **get an idea of my standing** (again, dumbass hs junior so idek if this is helpful, but **literally any info would help):**

* SAT: 1470 (Conservatively Expected: \~1520-1540) | I've literally only taken one SAT just for the fun of it (free waiver). Taken practice tests since and averaging 1500, can easily boost to 1530 minimum by Senior year application deadlines
* GPA: 3.97 Unweighted Cumul. | 4.62 Core | 4.96 Weighted Cumul.
* Top 5% Class (17/302, very competitive HS)
* APs: 7 Total As Of Junior Year | Expected 12 Total in Senior
   * Taking 4 Currently, 3 Completed | Ngl never cared about passing them, just wanted GPA boost, prolly gonna bother studying for all 4-5s this year:

I studied veterinary bioscience for 2 years in an IT in Ireland. It was a very stressful 2 years. I scrapped through a lot of content. I found learning Anatomy extremely difficult, and the chemistry based modules, as I had never done chemistry prior to this course. I deffered a year from the course and then decided to get an exit award in Animal Bioscience (as I had passed and completed the two years). I got an average of a mid 2.1 in first year, and a mid 2.2 in 2nd year. If the course is still running, and they accept me back I could always complete the remaining 2 years. 

The reason for deffering was I had a mental break down during the summer months prior to deffering. I have Irritable Bowel Sydnrome and it had flared up very badly during those 2 years, I get bloated and I pass a lot of wind essentially. Consequently, I found sitting in lectures very difficult and would run out of lectures quite often (to go to the bathroom and calm down essentially).I had been given a hard time from my classmates for my social anxiety and my condition. It took a toll on my mental health, and I didn't want to continue studying with that class. I had a placement that summer in a research facility in pig units, and I really enjoyed it, but the stress was too much at the time, as I was cold turkey on my medication (antidepressants), and was trying to pass a deffered exam and a repeat exam.

In the meantime I took an art course during my year out, and decided not to go back to the science course despite having a place in third year. I am currently doing art teaching (in 2nd year), and my bloating and anxiety are controlled for the most part. I still run to the bathroom occasionally, but not hardly as much. The art teaching degree is straight forward and not difficult. We don't have exams only projects, presentations and group work. 

This sounds like a no brainer right? Don't go back? But, I can't help feeling I missed out on an opportunity to complete something really difficult (and worthwhile), and apply to vet school. There's people from the veterinary bioscience course studying now vet med in Slovakia and because of the cross over with the veterinary bioscience course, they have gone straight into 3rd year (a 4yr year course). The killer thing is two out of the four girls that are there I know in my heart of hearts are around the same intelligence as myself, but without the anxiety and IBS. I don't want my conditions to hold me back in life, and as a child I was invested in animals, and still am to this day.. There's this sense of awe at these people who made it, but also an intense sense of jealousy. That's how I know it's something that I really want.. 

I want to finish a degree at least (I need to prove to myself that my challenges won't stop me) and I think I will finish the art course, and see from there, as I've being working part time in a supermarket with years to fund my education.. And although art teaching is not overly well paid, it's better than the pay from working in a supermarket. But what do I do in the meantime, should I volunteer in a vet clinic or animal settings to gain experience and see if pursuing veterinary is what I want to do? Or should I turn a blind eye, and run away from my dreams once again?

Now, with that out of the way, I've come to Reddit, to ask you guys for some advice, support, or maybe a little bit of hope when it comes to making friends at university.

Some backstory: I'm currently a sophomore at a large public university and I have 0 close friends at school. I'm not some creeper, weeb, weirdo, or the spastic guy who struggles to fit in. I'm pretty average... I look okay (in my opinion), dress just fine, and I'm really good at talking to people. I've met some really cool people while at college, but none of them have transitioned into actual friendships. In high school, I wasn't popular, but I went through different groups of friends throughout my 4 years. Senior year, I met a great group of guys and I cherish every moment I get to spend with them. When I go back during breaks, we'll road trip to different states, go to bars, parties, hike, snowboard, you name it, we've probably done it. It's awesome to have a group of friends like that, but when it comes to university, I'm dead in the water.

I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. I am in several clubs, all of my classes are (now) in person, and I always like to strike up conversations with those who are willing. Freshman year I even pledged a couple of fraternities, only to realize that all the partying, meaningless drunk sex, and insane fees to be a member just weren't worth it. I also double major and work so it just wasn't going to happen with my schedule. The point I'm getting at is that (I assume) people don't despise me. Imo, I'm fun to be around, have a good sense of morals and empathy, and have a pretty good sense of humor. I've also got some pretty cool hobbies as well, yet I cannot, for the life of me, find people that I want to get closer to (or they want to get closer to me).

It's sad. I'll go to a club meeting, or a party, meet some cool-ish people, but we just don't click the way I want and I forget about them. I'd really love to find some people who share similar interests as me and a similar personality type as well but it's just not working. I'm starting to think that I've become too introverted between my work, studies, and other personal matters. All I really have is my girlfriend (of two years) who is always willing to spend time with me. I know, that sounds douchy. I love her, so much, but I need an actual group of friends... you know, friends of the same gender that I'm not sleeping with.

I don't really know what to do at this point other than continue to talk to people in my classes and hope I meet someone who's down-to-earth, smart, funny, and well-spoken like myself. I guess I can just wait? I hate the idea of that, I've always been a go-getter, and when I want something I don't just sit on my ass, be sad, and complain, yet that feels like that's what is happening and I'm starting to think that maybe I'm the problem. Maybe I'm being too selective about who I want to get close to. I don't know...

Really I'm looking for advice, or idk maybe someone to comment on how they're in a similar situation to give me some hope? How can I not find anyone like me at a school with 50,000+ students? Surely, I have to be too selective with who I choose to spend my time with?

As of right now, I have my head down. I'm killing my classes, making some serious cash at my job to pay for school, and also trying to develop myself. It's like I'm in grind mode and because of this, I've let the last year and a half-slip away from me. So here I am, Friday night, sitting at home, thinking to myself ""why am I the one who can't make friends."" I see so many people, with so many flaws, who seem to somehow have friends of their own. I mean, how does the kid with the rolley backpack who picks his nose in class have friends but I don't. I just don't get it, man. Life is a fucking rollercoaster and right now I'm definitely in a slump.

Anyways, if you read this far you're a real one and I appreciate it. Thanks, and happy Friday!",college,"Halfway through college, still no friends, am I the problem?",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/puttj4/halfway_through_college_still_no_friends_am_i_the/,1632539750.0

I'm a 3rd year pharmacy student right now and I got an offer to work at a chain pharmacy as a pharmacy clerk (part time, $15.50/hr). The pay is barely above minimum where I'm from, but my main goal is to get experience. Just for info, a pharmacy clerk doesn't have certification. A pharmacy tech can work with or without certification. Pharmacy interns must have an intern permit. I do not have a tech license and I'll be getting my intern permit after the end of this school year.

My initial plan was to get a job as a pharmacy tech. I applied to a few pharmacies nearby, but I wasn't able to get anything back. The one position that heard back from and got an offer for was this pharmacy clerk position. I have 7 days to make a decision. 

The pharmacist at this store was very understanding when I expressed that I was looking to be a pharmacy tech and will want to move to an intern position later, but clerk is the only position they have available at this store. 

What I want to ask is: should take this pharmacy clerk job now, work until I get my intern permit, and then either ask for a promotion to an intern in this store if there's availability (or look for an intern position at another store)? Or, should I reject this clerk position and continue looking for a pharmacy tech position? Will being a pharmacy tech instead of a clerk give me a significant advantage if I have to look for an intern position at another store in the future? Another concern is that I'm afraid if I reject this one, and then can't find another job, I'll have no experience at all.

I treated high school as a social experience and all but completely blew off academics. After that my parents talked me into going to a community college for a semester. I took world history and a language arts class. I enjoy history so I did well in that but I didn't care at all about the LA class and probably failed that one, I didn't even really care enough to find out.

156,bwsapril,1631828187,/r/college/comments/ppmp5v/i_am_going_to_apply_for_a_masters_this_year_i/,"Although this is not a post where I ask for advice or opinions, feel free to comment whatever you want, if you want to.

Soon I'll be 29. I got my computer engineering bachelor's 7 years ago and have been working ever since. Although I was a picky student, lazy and my gpa has never been a 4.0, I genuinely enjoyed studying the subjects I was putting effort to. After graduating I decided to not apply for a master due to financial problems and family issues. It was not something I was happy about but I did what I thought was the right thing. 

Since that day, I have from time to time considered starting a master degree. One time I actually sent two applications (uni and scholarship, because I was at my beginnings and still very much broke). Got rejected in both. Two years later I got most of the things ready and even started some applications, but never finished the whole process. I didn't have the confidence that I could make it, but also I mismanaged the time and left some things for the last minute. 

Right now I have a job that I don't dislike, although I don't love it either. I know more than what I knew last year, although still feel like my years of experience don't add up to the amount of skills I should have by now. I live alone and somewhat away from my family. Sometimes that's hard (living alone I mean). Sometimes I feel lonely. Don't have many friends around. Don't like myself much.

I feel like I am getting older, lazier and my mind is not what it used to be. And I have never been particularly intelligent to begin with. If things go as planned, by next year I'll have just enough savings to support myself for two years in the chance that I start a master and can't find a single job for the whole duration, but not a penny more. I wouldn't mind working a part time job that has nothing to do with my profession, especially if its a job I don't hate. 

I don't expect to be admitted to a top 50, or 100, or 200 university. I don't think a master will necessarily make me a better developer, I don't believe it will make me look better in future job applications, I don't think I or anyone need to have master's degree, I don't think school is the only way or necessarily best way to learn. 

I am not good at networking, and when I think of recommendation letters, there is only one person left (my previous team leader) that could help me. I am well aware that my gpa and portfolio don't stand out and maybe all schools I apply to will reject me. I know I am bad at applications, selling myself or words in general.

I don't think I will apply for a scholarship although the idea of loosing all my savings if I can't get a part time job makes me wanna cry. After all, I don't have a home, or alternative financial resources, or support system. But the idea of asking for some government to pay for my expenses at a time of my life when I responsible *and capable* of doing that by myself makes me feel uncomfortable. 

Overall I would say that my chances of getting admitted to a university of my choice are slim, I could spend part or all of my savings, I could end up failing, I could waste these two years without gaining any professional advancement. I might not have a good or clear career plan, but studying most probably won't help. Although I don't like my life, this decision is not made under the impression that it will turn things around. Although I don't like myself, starting all over will not fix me. 

However, I have come to the realization that I just want to spend my next two years studying, because I like learning. Of course I could learn lots of things at work, but they are not the kind of thing I am particularly curious about and there are always restrictions derived from client needs. I could try to study while working, but I don't have the energy or discipline to do that. So when I think of my life and its meaning, I have to admit it is pretty pointless and joyless. I might as well try to do something I want to do for a while.",college,I am going to apply for a master's this year - I think,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ppmp5v/i_am_going_to_apply_for_a_masters_this_year_i/,1631846187.0

159,solstice006,1631499244,/r/college/comments/pn6baj/should_i_keep_going/,"Like a lot of people, I just started my first term after graduating high school. I'm going to a community College that my dad suggested I go to since it's close to my step mom's house and that I didn't have to drive far to get there if I lived there for most of the time, but I wouldn't get to see my mom very often at all because of this or have any of my stuff like my computer and game consoles.

All my friends are going to a different community College so I don't know anyone here, and i had to quickly learn to drive and get a license all through out the summer so I could actually drive there, but even now I can never drive alone because of the road I'm not used to and the sun shining right on my face and the road to where the scratched out lines are near impossible to see, and yeah I could just go in a straight line since that is what it really takes, but the lanes shift from right to left too so I'm all pit of options on what to do, and I would know since the first time I actually got out to drive by myself I got myself into a wreck and now im having to deal with getting insurance and adding a whole other layer to all of this, and everyone is getting stressed out and mad because of my mistakes and I'm always getting the short end of the stick everytime

Those last couple paragraphs don't have much to do with college in itself, but that's just some of the small stuff within all this that kind of contribute to this. I mentioned I'm going to a community college so it isn't a university or anything big at all (around the size of two houses maybe) I'm taking around 6 classes, one of which is online and for First Year students, which so far isn't really a hard class, but completely unnecessary and offers practically nothing for college overall. I'm soon to enter i believe my 4th week, and I'm just not getting the hang of anything at all.

I'm taking my basics like many people do, but other than the fact that this stuff is literally the same stuff I already did in high school, it's on a whole different level at the same time. I was always able to get my work done fairly easy in high school because I always did it in class or study hall, but we dont have that stuff in college, we just do our hour long lecture, get out and go to the next lecture, and go home to do the homework I got. 

The first week or 2 I was able to pay attention well to lectures and be able to write down notes, as well as do the homework for the most part, but now, I dont even know anymore, I can't get any motivation to do half of it, and I just see myself just staring at my assignment just wondering what I'm supposed to do, and none of these lectures are helping me learn anything. I can't focus on everything the professors talk about, I'm not the best listener nor am I exactly an auditory learner either, the stuff I should be writing notes on I completely miss, and there's no notes on the board or any PowerPoint to help me write enough notes on like I would always able to in high school.

I can't even make myself do what I have to do on most of this stuff, stuff that they already made me do before with the only difference being that they added a small extra step to it, with me just sitting and thinking what I'm even supposed to be doing and repeating what I just read or wrote, and I just don't understand what this is supposed to help me with my future and career. I can really only bother doing Algebra and some career class since I actually have some interest or better knowledge of it, even classes like history or philosophy which I though would be interesting are made very exhausting and tedious for some reason, and my parents say that I'm not trying hard enough to enjoy them, but why would I have chosen those classes to begin with if that wasn't my intent.

I've already gone on too long, I just don't see a point in going through the rest if I'm not learning anything valuable for my future or career, the only thing I would have on the line is my associates degree, and I'm on the line thinking how much it would benefit me because I've been told both sides that it will help me live or that i cam do without it. The time I spend in college is time I could spend getting some job experience, I've never had a job so I can't be expected to get a high paying job without at least working at a fast food chain or something similar, or I could learn something useful for an actual career like going to trade school or learning how to code perhaps. If I do decide to drop out, what should be my next step? And how can I continue if I don't? How do I make this decision after my parents and I spent my whole senior year planning this out?

I have none of that, no support system or whatsoever. the teachers here aren't really teaching from the heart, but instead, teaching it because they forcibly have to and for their paycheck, they don't give a fuck if you learn in their class. classes I'm taking are completely fucking useless and it's a big waste of time, but I knew what I was getting into so how could I complain?

161,No_Gas_184,1631306854,/r/college/comments/pltca7/should_i_drop_out/,"Right now I am still enrolled at a local community college, but I got an offer for an assembler job making 18 an hour. I know what kind of environment it's going to be since I have some friends working there. Basically, you just get to sit all day making parts. Nothing too difficult, boring at times, but it's decent money and no getting yelled at (I worked at the call center for 2 years before, so that makes this assembler position sound especially tempting).
I already have a masters degree in translation from a foreign university, but had trouble finding steady employment. The jobs are very scant, and those that pop up tend to be extremely competitive. I tried getting into copywriting, but as a non native speaker I tend to attract mainly crappy clients that are not even willing to pay minimum wage. I sometimes do phone interpreting, but that job is honestly killing me mentally. Plus I'm paid per minute, so the better I get, the less money I am making.
That is why I decided to get an associates and potentially transfer into a four year institution for computer science or engineering. So far I've aced my Calc and statistics classes, and I like programming well enough. I don't like it as much as writing, but I can imagine myself doing it 8 hours a day without killing myself. 
However, throughout all that I've been feeling incredibly guilty about the finances. My husband makes enough for us both, but I think it's unfair for him to be the sole provider. Those 18 bucks an hour could really help us renovate the house faster, invest more, pay off his student loans. And here I am being a kid and going back to college. All for what? For an illusory possibility to make 60k down the line? 
I just know how competitive the job market is, and this job offer feels like a miracle that I cannot pass. Especially for someone like me - an immigrant with an irrelevant degree and barely any American work experience.
Besides, I know of people who were able to move up in the company and become planners, buyers and supervisors, making 50-60k a year. So there's def room for growth there. 
The problem is that I'm afraid not having an American degree will forever be a blemish on my resume and will make it harder for me to get interviews. Another reason for hesitation is the fact that I love school. I have always dreamt about studying in the US, but never had the money to go. Now that I have the money, I think I'm too old and can't stop feeling guilty about not working full - time.

Since the pandemic has started my mental health has deteriorated because of the relationship with my parents and separation from my friends who were my emotional support system, and the stress of school online. Covid and its effect on the world scared me and ny parents (particularly my mom) has said some really damaging things that I still haven't recovered from.

Hi everyone! 23 year old, female, 2020 grad in the US and current math/english/computer science tutor here. Been a TA in 3 different disciplines, convinced professors to restructure classes, gotten WIFI upgrades for a whole dorm building, and so on. I want to share that knowledge with people that can use it, since it made my life so much easier in school. After hearing from so many of my students, and seeing so many ""advice for new college student"" posts all over reddit, I wanted to post here with a list of some of the best tricks I accumulated in my time at school. Some may apply more than others, since my school was on the smaller side. However, many center around one thing - get to know the people who work at the school. And not just your professors. They know things and can help in ways you don't even know about.

Much of this is from personal experience, or from stuff I've heard from friends or tutoring students. Don't take it all as gospel, since some of it may not apply to the college you're at but try to read it for some of the general concepts if nothing else. Also I am sorry it's so long, I really want to give y'all as many tools as possible though. 

# The FIRST and most important thing is names.

Names are one of your greatest weapons. People like to be remembered. And you can get a lot more help if you can ask for a senior person by name. Not in a demand-y way, of course, but being able to say ""Oh, is there any chance that Bob is in today? He was great when I needed help with X, Y, Z last time!"" doubles as a compliment and a means of getting speedier/better help! **Keep a running notes list of people and interactions with them.** I recommend in your phone, either as an actual list, or a series of contacts with their company field set to their job, a phone number for them/their department, and whatever other info you find helpful in the actual notes part. Seems like a bunch of clerical work but it is OH SO HELPFUL when you need a new bed frame and can just open contacts, type in ""SCHOOLNAME maintenance"" and see that you had Steve fix your door when the lock broke and Glenda was the nice desk woman who sent him.

Given the above example, here is a good starter list of people to know/get help from

* **Janitors or maintenance people** \- they like you? You've been nice to them? They'll be more helpful than they probably would. Most people think of them as background, but they're the reason the showers work, the heaters don't spew dust and can fix your door when the lock gets jammed. By senior year I had enough cred with these guys that I got a full new set of furniture and mattresses for my room. Totally worth it.
* **The person that answers the phone in the maintenance office**. They just know most, if not all, of the maintenance guys, and probably a lot of coordination and behind the scenes people at the school. Call with a simple question, and REMEMBER (or write down) their name.
* **Security guards -**  most schools will have a main security number that you can call for a bunch of stuff they may not actually mention. I had some joint issues that screwed up my ankle for a few years. Sometimes walking across campus between classes wasn't possible. I could call them up and they'd come pick me up and make sure I got to class okay. This was not an accommodation thing either, they did it for anyone that asked. It also applied to feeling unsafe walking around at night, etc. It can really help. Keep the security number in your phone as a contact all its own.
* **Teachers assistants / free tutors etc -** I'm talking about the writing center, the math tutoring that many schools have, TA's that have office hours, lab TA's and on and on. If they're still a student and working in some teaching capacity its VERY likely that they WANT to help and really enjoy it. I loved hanging out in the ceramics lab when I was a TA and was always THRILLED to be asked for help. We do it to help, and if you're nice to us we'll often go above and beyond. There is another side to this, if you go to tutoring/office hours of those student teachers and TA's - you'll meet other people (probably from your class) that are trying to study. Possible new friends or at least fellow commiserators are always a plus! And you'll have more people to panic text if you're not sure when an assignment is due.
* **The IT desk people -** They keep the wifi up. And the wifi is usually very important for studying, etc. Make sure you know the name of at least one actual university staff member that works there. They often hire students, and the students can help but are usually rather limited. Also, if you ever need to get them to fix something, especially in a dorm, get at least one or two other people to agree its happened to them and then call it an outage. The word ""outage"" indicates a special kind of *get on this right now* in IT. I got the Wifi in my dorm upgraded cause I went to them with a petition from like 30 people about how bad the wifi had gotten in my dorm :)

I took a lot of classes across a lot of disciplines, so each trick's usefulness may vary school to school, though many of them are pretty all encompassing.

* READ the syllabus. It will tell you many things that are not explicitly written.
   * For example: Is there a schedule? Yes? Good! You should write all those dates in your planner/calendar. No? Pay closer attention to what the professor says is upcoming during lectures. Profs will often tell you if they will move exams slightly during syllabus day. Remember which ones they are, cause they're more likely to reschedule a test if another couple major courses have an exam the same day. 
* Many people talk about picking the class for the professor. ALSO PICK IT FOR THE TA/GRADER, WHEN APPLICABLE.
   * Find out if the class is graded by the actual professor, a grader or a TA. Many classes, especially smaller schools will have things like math homework graded by TA's/graders and exams etc graded by professors. This saved me because physics lab was TA-graded and I managed to pick the section of the most experienced and lenient grading TA. Made a hard class WAYYYYY more manageable.
* IF you are unsure which of a few general requirements to take, sign up for one (or even two) extra, go to each of them and drop the ones that seem the least appealing. Base this at least partially on the professor.
   * You may get there, see the syllabus and go ""SIX ESSAYS at least TEN pages EACH?!"" and be able to have a fall back class that still fills a requirement. This way you're not scrambling to find a replacement when the good courses are full.
* WHENEVER you have an essay due, make an outline that's fleshed out enough to give an idea of your thoughts and arguments, at least a week before the due date. Then schedule a meeting with the professor to go over it.
   * The feedback they give is always helpful, follow it. People like their ideas acknowledged. The most important thing (at least that I found) was how they reacted to it. Did they like it? Keep it. Didn't like it? Tell them next class that you reworked the topic cause you thought of something else. They have to read tons of papers, and interesting papers or ones that aren't about the Same Thing tend to not be compared to as many. The smaller the sample size of papers for that topic, the more likely you are to not be graded as harshly. 
* If you dislike a professor, offer to help them. Show up to their office hours, even just to chat. Chances are that a lot of students dislike them, and a little kindness goes a long way.
   * Even the profs I disliked for their teaching style were cool human beings. Professors that are actually BAD on all fronts are rather rare. See the good side and play into interacting with them that way. In doing this, I convinced the worst (terrible teacher, questionable human sometimes, but very intelligent) professor that the computer science department ever had that I was fond of him. Talked him out of some bad pop quizzes, and managed to make him filibuster his way through several whole 2 hr class periods just telling me about his life. Honey over vinegar, always.
* If a class isn't limited by some resource that determines the number of spots (i.e. pottery wheels, computer desks, physical seats in the classroom etc) and you want into it, get on the waiting list and then just SHOW up to it.
   * On the first day of classes, show up to that course with a printed add/drop form and say you're on the waiting list (if you're first on it, mention that too, otherwise just say you're on it). Then ask if they would be able to add you. That max number of seats (unless determined by materials) is often set by the professor, and can be overridden by the professor. Trust me it feels weird, but the worst they can do is say, sorry no I can't let more students in. This shows the prof that you will actively participate, you're on top of things etc. Have the prof sign the add/drop and then immediately go get it put into your schedule at the registrar's office. In person. This never failed to get me into a course.
* Some professors, despite being professors, are noticeably better at teaching one-on-one than lecturing to a larger class. If possible, go to their office hours, or schedule a meeting with them to get help.
   * Usually you won't know until you try, so I highly advise trying. They have office hours for a reason. Bring a study guide, your notes, some part of the slides/book that didn't make sense. Being able to show them material helps a lot in getting a good explanation too. 
* If your professor is unavailable, or you don't gel with their teaching style but can't switch sections of the class to get a different prof, go to ANOTHER PROF'S office hours. Even if you like your prof, but they're busy or something doesn't make sense, try another person's explanations :)
   * Feels weird right? Surprisingly, most profs don't mind this. Don't tell other prof that your prof is bad, just say they're super busy today and I was wondering if you're able to help with X. Sometimes even if they don't teach the class they have in the past or they know the material. This saved me in O-Chem, on many many occasions. If you go back to them again, just say ""The way you explained.... really helped me understand the material better! So I wanted to ask about this....."". Those compliment questions will get you far.
* Befriend as many upperclassmen as possible, both in your major and out.
   * The ones that have been TA's often know how stuff is graded (we see A LOT of the rubrics) and the rest can point you in the direction of the good professors at the very least. The real heroes will sometimes even give you old notes. 
   * Especially in computer science this SAVED me more times than I can count. Newer students would ask the upperclassmen for help in the computer labs ALL THE TIME. And that student solidarity kicks in and all of the sudden the freshman that couldn't make their game render properly has a few of the best students in the major debating what could be causing it, and 10 min later - it's fixed. It really does take a village to survive college, so make sure you know the more experienced villagers.
* Stay ON TOP OF your homework. Especially in smaller schools where the prof might notice  if you don't. 
   * When life does happen and you need an extension, being able to say (with the gradebook to back you up) that you've worked really hard to stay on top of assignments and this is the first (or one of the few times) that you've been late on something makes a HUGE difference. I know homework sucks, but if its assigned there's a purpose. Even if its busywork, it's points you don't have to get later.
* Asking IN ADVANCE for an extension. Even if it's just the day before. 
   * Email your professor something along the lines of ""Hi Professor X, &lt;newline&gt; I had thought I could finish assignment Y for class Z by the due date tomorrow, but now that I'm partway through it I don't think I will be able to finish it in time and do a good job on it. Could I have a 24hr extension? &lt;newline&gt; Thank you, Cat"" or some similar variation if a health emergency or other impeding thing comes up. 
   * Always, ALWAYS mention being partway done since that is often the case and makes it about circumstances or not having enough time to finish (rather than a case of i-didnt-start-yet-oh-no).
* Have MULTIPLE advisors - at least one in your major and one in your minor. There are many many benefits, and most schools don't limit how many advisors you have.
   * If you get assigned a bad advisor at the start of freshman year DO NOT try to change and remove the original advisor. Especially if you will have to take classes from them. It can be seen as an insult and is hard to make fully inoffensive. If you have multiple though, they're not the end-all be-all of signing off on things for you. 
   * Multiple advisors means multiple people that can be asked to sign off on that last minute add drop form you need (saved me 3 times in the 2 years where I had two advisors).
   * Multiple perspectives on how to navigate the system, what classes are suited for you etc. Works especially well with two profs from the same department, especially if one went to school there or has been there for a long time. 
* CALL IN sick or missing class on important days or for classes that require attendance. (Mostly for small schools, where you know the prof)
   * Calling is the favored method of communication for many professors of older generations, so they'll often actually pick up the phone.
   * If you get voicemail, most (if not all) large systems like the university will have either send an email transcript of the message or an audio clip to the professor. They'll see it sooner usually cause they have to open it to see the contents.
   * Way better proof of needing to be out in a sincere little phone call than a short email. Especially good if you sound sick or in pain. Even if not, it somehow comes across less faked
* CALL your prof's office to see if they're around, or if their office hours are busy. Great way to get a quick question in without having to wait in a long office hours line, or hope your email gets seen.
   * If they're not there, decide if you want to leave a message or not. 
   * If they are there, and its office hours - ask if there's a lot of students waiting. If yes, ask if there's a better time to come in and talk to them, or see if you can just ask after class.  
* Course overrides are both a friend and a nemesis - they can help your schedule BUT make triple sure that you wont get too shafted by not having a requirement for a class you get an override for.
   * Some class pre-req's are actually a vague foundation that little to none of the material is based on, if you ask nicely some professors will sign you into the class and give an override of that requirement. Very useful, slightly dangerous. Apply with caution, and advice.

# Social and sundries

* Most schools have some sort of clubs fair in the first few weeks. GO TO IT. Look around, talk to people. No, no one is judging you for going alone, the whole point of a clubs fair is finding new groups of people with similar interests.
   * Pick a couple clubs that either interest you based on the people at the table, or on the actual topic of the club. Give yourself full permission to not like it and never go again, but go to the next meeting they have. People get that not all clubs are for everyone, I still have friends that I met in college freshman year just by trying out clubs. 
* The registrar's office is a vital place. A veritable hub of secret ways into classes that seem full. Always go in person when you need something, they know many tricks. They also have printed add/drop forms.
   * Remember the people that work the desk, they often enter course overrides by hand when registration opens, and if they like you, you may end up on top of the pile. 
* Don't feel like you HAVE to go to study sessions that friends invite you to. Sometimes they're wildly unproductive. 
   * I've never been one to learn well when there's a bunch of my friends in the room, so I would study by myself and occasionally go to study sessions to help friends or practice the material. Find your learning style and use that knowledge to be more effective in how you go about learning. Also, if applicable, tell your prof. Tell them that you're so sorry if you seem distracted in class, but you prefer to listen and doodle and then make notes from the text book later. Etc. 
* If you're unsure of when fun social stuff will come up PREEMPTIVELY do your homework.
   * Don't leave it till 10pm on a midnight deadline, only to find out everyone's meeting up in 15 min to go on some fun adventure. Do your homework between classes, before dinner etc. I did this all four years as much as I could and I got to go on a lot more last minute adventures than I would have. 
* IF you can manage it, have one day of the week as empty of classes as possible. Preferably somewhere in the middle. 
   * It gives time for errands, sleeping in a little, that essay thats due Friday, etc. Its a cushion day, and I recommend either Tuesday or Thursday since a lot of schools run classes that are MWF or T/Th. Tuesday is more for homework catch up if you know you're not a weekend homework person, and Thursday is more of a break in the week for the random stuff that comes up. At least in my experience. But consider it, its super nice just sanity wise too. 
* Consider getting a cheap monitor, keyboard, and mouse set up if you have a laptop. All you need is a usb hub and an hdmi cable to connect everything. 
   * Being able to have a reference AND your paper visible together is a beautiful beautiful thing. Or your math homework and Netflix, whatever floats your boat. 
* On a similar note, learn your context switching keys on your computer. Super helpful. See below for system:
   * Windows PC - alt + tab: switch between all open windows in order of most recent. Does not do it by program like mac. If it's open and separate it will be listed separately. Keep hitting tab to navigate on the little bar that pops up in the middle of your screen.
   * Mac - command + tab: switch between all open PROGRAMS. Will show the window for the front most open window of a program. 
   * Mac - command + \~: That's the tilde key, its right below the esc. This will switch between open windows of the program you're currently in. Like from the chrome window with my google doc to the one with my reference doc. 
* If you have a mac and HATE having windows maximized as much as I do, get the  [Spectacle app](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) to be able to use a couple easy keyboard commands to pick which side of the screen a window is put on, etc. Basically a way to have it work a little more like windows. Highly recommend.
* Attempt to log into to the staff wifi network and see if your school's staff wifi is locked to students. The one at my school wasn't, and it was significantly faster. 

# Some health/accommodation tips 

I have a bunch of allergies and other health issues that meant I couldn't eat cafeteria food, got a room to myself and some academic accommodations. I am no expert on any of this, but I did notice a few things, and I hope they can help some of you if you face similar circumstances. And as I said before, I'm here if anyone wants to talk or is having a hard time adjusting to dorm/college life with health challenges &lt;3

* If you have documented allergies, you can ask the accommodations office if they'll give you an academic accommodation so that you don't have to take a test while having a reaction. I only found this out junior year, and it was EXTREMELY helpful. Don't abuse it, but not having to take an 8am calc test when you can only kinda walk and barely think is a huge relief.
* It doesn't hurt to ask - see if they'll give you academic accommodations if you have anything health related on file. Could be as simple as more time to get between classes, or getting to skip the waitlist for the only section of a class that isn't 8am because you can't get food from the cafeteria that early. 
* They will clean the air vents to your room if you ask. Dust is not good for anyone, even if you're not really allergic to it. Just call maintenance and ask, or ask accommodations if you have something related that they know about. 
* Regardless of what your school has on file, TELL your professors as early on as possible that you have health stuff that affects your x, y and z academically. You don't need to tell them what it is (and I advise you don't since they can't form as many judgements about it), I would usually just say ""health conditions and allergies"". Even if you don't have something official, they're more likely to be understanding if you miss class or need extra help with something. 
* I was able to not have a roommate all 4 years of living in a dorm, so know that's entirely possible for most schools to do and I would suggest asking about it if you have severe allergies or something else that would make it helpful. 
* Just keep asking for help, going to different offices etc until they give you the accommodations that you need. 

Hope it helped!

169,thebulletinaction,1630103101,/r/college/comments/pcxktr/transferred_to_a_different_college_and_dont_know/,"Hi all,

To give some quick backstory, I graduated in 2019 and was accepted and attended the University of Michigan. What nobody had told me, however, was that pretty much 40% of my scholarship was based on need-based aid, something that fluctuated based on my EFC and my FAFSA. So off I went into freshman year, having the time of my life and getting everything out of college that I desired. Michigan was a perfect school for me in every stretch of the word. Big campus, great studies, amazing social life, loved Ann Arbor, had great friends, you know the jist.

Well, then covid hit, and as I was rounding the corner into my sophomore year, I had lost my need-based scholarship that had sent my out of pocket costs from $6,000 a year to $27,000 a year. However, due to the pandemic, they processed my aid very late, and as a result, I had figured out I could not afford my second year mere DAYS before I started my second year, so I was thrown into a gap year.

If you're a middle class student, I'm sure you're aware with how unfairly you are treated within the American Education System. Too rich for financial aid, too poor for out of pocket. Transferring out of state was impossible, so to say, and even if I did get into another great school, that EFC was going to fuck me over at one point, so it wasn't even worth it if I had to find out I had to transfer again.

So, locked within my home state of Kentucky, I looked for potential transfer schools. I was a CS student at the time, but through Michigan I was achieving the major WITHOUT going through the school of engineering. However, looking at my big state schools, they only had offered CS through engineering. That was a big nope for me. I switched majors to my other passion, Music Technology.

I then applied to a very small private, Catholic college in my city that offered the program, and I was accepted with pretty good financial aid. This financial aid is merit-based, and so it is permanent. I'm working at FedEx, and I will be able to use the tuition reimbursement to pay off my federal loans from the jump. I will also be living off campus with my best friends. And I will be chasing my dreams of becoming a performer. It's definitely not all bad, but now I'm going to talk about the bad.

I feel like an outcast on this campus. I'm not religious at all, and a lot of the people here I don't relate to at all. It has an undergrad population of about 2,500, and the campus is tiny. It doesn't feel like much is going on here. I tried to be proactive and look for clubs and activities to join. I'm not joking when I say there isn't anything except for environmental stuff and some club sports. I also hate commuting, and I feel like I miss out on many events because many of the stuff is word of mouth. And the social events just feel... forced, too. Overall, it is NOTHING like my old school, and the big state experience fits my personality better than this school ever will.

I guess if I had to summarize it, from a logistics standpoint it checks all my boxes, and I made best with the shitty hand I was dealt. But from an emotional and social standpoint, it makes me feel upset and trapped. Does anyone have any advice? I was maybe thinking about transferring again, but honestly I feel like I should just bite the bullet and make-do.

But it's so hard to not compare this new life with the one my old friends are still living, and the one that I physically can't live any longer. I don't want to have a bad college experience. Maybe it just takes some adjusting?",college,Transferred to a different college and don't know how to feel.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/pcxktr/transferred_to_a_different_college_and_dont_know/,1630121101.0
170,ScaredOfLife666,1630003138,/r/college/comments/pc5ncx/should_i_feel_guilty_for_having_my_parents_pay/," Long story short, I had strong anxiety when it came to driving so I never learned. The anxiety came from a combination of me knowing I had ADHD along with being aware of how common death was on the road. Because of this, I was always too afraid to even approach the road.

My plan was to take the bus to school since the bus stop is 5 minutes away (driving). This was initially the plan when my mom was still a stay-at-home mom. However, this changed significantly when my mom decided to take on a part-time accounting job and home school my youngest sister. She is now unable to drive me to the stop and because of how the roads work in my area, it isn't safe to walk. Way too much traffic. My parents are also going to be leaving for 3 weeks to visit family.

My parents decided that they would pay for me to live in a dorm on campus. They don't have to take out loans but it's still really pricey and it's getting to me. They claim that they want me to focus on ""enjoying the college experience"" and ""enjoy independence"" but I don't feel independent. I can't drive and I have mommy and daddy paying for my room. While I'm covering tuition on my own, I feel dumb when compared to my friends. They are going to CC, driving themselves to school while also working. It just makes me feel like a spoiled idiot.

171,ohaikaybai,1629921371,/r/college/comments/pbj072/trying_to_pick_a_major/,"So I'm looking at going back to school. I've had a couple goes but never graduated. My workplace offers a college program where they will pay for you to attend classes online. So long story short, due to how I was raised and kind of having my eyes opened to some religious trauma I have, one of the courses I am particularly drawn to is religious studies. All I really know is what I was raised in and only kind of bits and pieces of other religions. I don't really know that I want to have a religion right now, but I feel like I need to learn about all these others I was taught were bad and wrong and bound for hell.  I want to sort of deprogram myself but I'm also kind of hoping that maybe I could help others with religious trauma. My question is whether religious studies would be a good major or if I'd be better off with a counseling major. I feel like I need both, because I genuinely want to learn about other religions and I feel like I can't help people if I don't educate myself on other religions first and then get into counseling classes after.

I had some financial issues with school, therefore had to stop attending about 3 years ago. Got married, life flowed on; however, during that time we were saving to pay off what I owed. 

It is fully paid off now, thankfully. 

I am a performing arts major. Typically with these degrees you are physically in and out in 4 years or you're looked at as lazy/lesser than/can't keep up with the competition.

I explained my financial issues prior to me needing to leave and they basically said to figure it out. They said if I took any more time off then I'd have to audit every single class again to prove I can be a performance major &amp; I can't keep taking time off. 

I expressed I am not just taking time off for fun, I have financial issues. That is irrelevant in their eyes.

Now I feel like a lesser than performance artist in my town unless I finish my degree.

I'm 33 credits (2 semesters) shy of graduation. Should I reach out after all this time and see if they'd even let me finish at this point/see my options? or should I just try and make do without a degree?

Any thoughts on this situation are appreciated.

I am infuriated, frustrated, but more than anything I am in a MAJOR panic financially as this could destroy me. I am VERY low income but I am fighting to complete my master's degree and improve my quality of life.

Through undergrad I never really did the summer thing, but I ALWAYS knew the requirements for summer course loads are different than regular semester loads. For example, my friend's uni has a 4 credit minimum for full time enrollment for summer. Apparently, my school is the same for all semester. so 12 credit minimum to be considered full time, even in the summer (yikes..)   


Apparently as well, to get aid from FAFSA, you need a minimum of 5 credits. I did not know this. I tried digging around to find this information on my school's website, and it's legit just not there and the information is very difficult to find. I had to search on the .gov website to find the info.   


long story short, I enrolled for a summer course. Financial aid never said anything to me. I enrolled, applied for aid, was granted aid. half way through summer course I'm like where the flip is my aid? I reach out to them to ask what the hold up is (delays have been common especially since covid) and then they inform me because my class is only worth 4 credits, I do not qualify for aid and it is too late to drop the course and now I can pay the full 5k and keep the course going, or drop it and pay a % of the tuition cost. (roughly 3,000) W.T.F!? Had I know about the 5 credit minimum I would not have enrolled into summer courses, ESPECIALLY because for my degree only one 4 credit course was even available. I am trying to petition but they're saying I have to be mentally ill or sick, or have a death in the family and prove to them this to get the refund for extenuating circumstances. I did that, showing meds I have, a divorce I went through (even those it's not even the reason but whatever I cant afford the fee they're trying to give me) but I don't think anything I submitted qualified as the timing of my divorce and my meds/depression was a month or two prior to the start of summer semester.   


Does anyone feel this is off at all? Shouldn't financial aid have reached out to me sooner to warn me BEFORE the deadline that I don't qualify for student aid? I'm trying so hard to fight this as this could force me to drop out of my degree all together as I just straight up don't have the fund to pay nearly 3,000 out of pocket :(",college,"USA.

181,Kitchen_Concern_2470,1626235155,/r/college/comments/ojwc7r/will_my_university_take_me_back_as_an/,"I started university in 2012. I've been on academic probation twice and to be clear, this was because of poor academic performance (and not for what I perceive to be more serious offenses such as dishonesty or plagiarism). I only managed to complete about 65% of credits required to earn the degree.

In my university, there's some criteria that will put you on academic probation so you pledge to do better (and if you don't, you're kicked out) and this can happen twice. However, the School policy says that in \*exceptional\* cases a third academic probation my be granted. Also, I abandoned my studies three years ago. The School policy says that if you want to take a leave you have to request it (which I didn't do) and that it can be for a maximum of one year. I can still log in to the students' website, though it says that I have ""academic problem"" and that I need to talk to the school principal to discuss my situation before I'm able to enroll in more classes (I don't know if they would just automatically expel me after so many years or if it means anything that they haven't so I remain hopeful). I live in a Latin American country and there are no ""student loans"" or anything like that here, this university is private so I'd pay myself for my education.

In these three years I've been working full time in a job related to my major and I've been doing pretty good. I've grown a lot: I've become more disciplined and I feel like I'm better equipped to succeed at school than I was before. I left school because I thought that I was just too stupid to finish the degree (I was depressed and still go the the psychiatrist and take antidepressants), but now I realize that I could have improved my academic performance by working harder and even if my classmates were really smarter than me, which I doubt, I should have just worked even harder (this seems obvious to me now, but I couldn't see it back then). It enrages me how I threw away the opportunity to study back then.

I was majoring in actuarial science and my plan is to pass three or four actuarial exams (from the Society of Actuaries) before I go talk to the principal. The passed exams will provide convincing proof that I am more disciplined and organized now (as some of these exams are pretty hard) and that I the knowledge and abilities required to continue my degree just where I left it remain fresh. Studying and passing these exams might take 1.5 or 2 years, I expect. Also, I'm prepared to leave my job to commit full time to my education shall I receive the opportunity to go back (or even before to study for the exams).

My question is: **does my plan look good to you? is it realistic to expect my university to take me back if I show them my hard work (thorough the passed exams)?**

If I can't go back, I might enroll in another university, but that's my plan B.",college,Will my university take me back as an undergraduate student?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ojwc7r/will_my_university_take_me_back_as_an/,1626253155.0
182,DebtFreeFamilyTree,1626186650,/r/college/comments/ojgs4m/how_much_debt_is_too_much_debt_for_college/,"I wanted to get perspective from students looking towards college, or in the first year or two of college, and share my own. How much debt do you think is too much??? How are you going to determine how much to borrow for college?

OUR STORY/PERSPECTIVE: In short, my wife and I had six figures of student loan debt early when we got married. We got out of debt, but it definitely kicked our butt and slowed down our timeline for life's milestones. Looking back, we wish we would have had someone swoop in and warn us before signing on the dotted line for such significant loans. We are pro education, but realized looking backwards that we could have taken a much better path towards the same degrees. So here is some perspective from someone in their 30s on how much student loan debt is too much...

A FEW MUSINGS ON DEBT:

* Some people might tell you not to worry about student loan amounts because it is good debt, as opposed to credit cards, for example, which is bad debt. The reasoning is typically something like ""it's for education, so any amount is justified"".
* Let me tell you from personal experience paying off six figures of student loans. STUDENT LOANS CAN BE BAD DEBT. Here is why:
   * **You can't sell it.** It's not like most other things you borrow money for (house, business, car, etc). A degree's resale value depreciates to 0.
   * **You can't get rid of it.** You can't get away from this debt. Student loans are guaranteed by the federal government, and the government is not to be messed with. Student loans are *non bankruptable*. Which means even if you get in a really bad spot and declare bankruptcy, this debt still follows you around.
   * **A degree from a ""fancier"" school won't lead to a better income.** You can find some exceptions, but as you look at average income data, it really doesn't make much difference if you go to a fancy school. What makes most of the difference is the type of career you pursue, and your level of excellence. Once you get into the workplace for a few years, nobody cares where you went to school. Do the research and compare average incomes of graduates with your desired degree from your dream school and compare that with graduates with the same degree that took a more affordable path (state school, community college, etc) and you'll notice there is rarely much if any difference.
   * **You won't be saved by the government for free.** The forgiveness programs get lots of attention, but they come at the cost of job flexibility, higher income, and a huge underlying stress that you'll forget to check an administrative box and be disqualified, or that the programs will be changed by some politician in the next 10-25 years, or that the government will simply not make good on its promise.
   * **In summary, whatever you borrow, you will have to pay back.** Ideally in the 5 years after you graduate, 10 max.

I know for some this is not fun to hear and can come off as elitist or classist. That if you don't come from money you can't pursue your dream. I know it can be really tough to feel set back and not be able to graduate from your dream school. Unfortunately, given our current system, this is the reality. If you borrow too much the dream turns into a nightmare. Fortunately, there are ways to get to the dream more affordably. 

SOME RULES OF THUMB:

These rules of thumb are basically rooted in the idea that most folks, once they hit their mid to late 20's or 30's, want to buy homes, start families, start a new business, save for retirement, etc. So in short, you don't want a pile of student loan debt hanging over your head any longer than 5-10 years so you can enter this new phase of life.

* **Rule of Thumb 1:** The **BEST** approach is to find a way to graduate debt free
* **Rule of Thumb 2:** If you are unsure that you wish to have a career, **NEVER** take out student loans
   * If you know developing a career isn't important to you (you might wish to be a stay at home parent, wish to work part time, live an alternative lifestlye, etc)
* **Rule of Thumb 3:** If you must borrow, **NEVER** borrow more than your starting annual salary of your career
   * The reason behind this rule of thumb is that once you borrow more than this amount, it becomes unlikely you'll be able to payoff that debt within 10 years, making it more likely to get in the way of your life in your 30s and 40s
   * Here are some examples of this rule of thumb in action:
      * If you don't know what you want your career to be, assume you'll have an average income of 35k to start your career, don't borrow more than 35k total
      * If you know you want to be a lawyer, and the average lawyer in your specialty makes 100K, don't borrow more than a total of 100K for undergrad and law school combined
      * If you wish to be a family practice doctor and the typical family practice doc makes 150k, don't borrow more than 150k to get through undergrad and medical school combined
      * If you wish to be an anesthesiologist and the average makes 300k, don't borrow more than 300k through undergrad and medical school combined
   * Of course, I'd love for you to borrow less in any circumstance. But if you're planning out your future and that involves borrowing more than one years income, STOP. You are passing a line into a danger zone, and the farther you get past it the more dangerous and suffocating this choice will become.
   * There are some careers that are just ridiculous. Watch out for them. The system is broken, and people ""trust"" that borrowing is just a part of the process and there must be a way to pay it back, because their peers are borrowing lots of money too. Here are careers I've come across that seem to set people up to violate this rule of thumb: Family practice doctors, Chiropractors, Physical Therapists, Non-Corporate lawyers, Teachers with Masters degrees, etc... And guess how these folks tend to feel about borrowing for an education when they reach their 30s? Regretful.

THERE IS STILL HOPE:

That's it for me for now :) Wishing y'all the best as you transition to this exciting stage of life.

But I literally got about a 1/4th of what I needed to cover this year. Actually, maybe less. Because I worked last year and I made decent money (that all went towards bills and a car. But whatever.) I had to stop working in April because of some personal issues (which I thought was fine because my financial aid was covering my tuition and I had some savings to cover the cost of living) and now I'm basically fucked. 

So I'm going back to work full time doing overnight shifts and I am finishing out a few Gen ed online classes for the fall semester so I can live with my parents and then go residential in the spring. But I still can't even afford that. 

In order to pay for an education. I have to kill myself by overloading myself so much that I want to basically die. 

And then after I get done with school I'm still going to have  remaining loans left. (Even if I gave up on law school) so I'm gonna have to keep going paying off these loans for God knows how long with whatever job I can get. 

I'm just really depressed. Because what I've literally dreamed about is so far out of reach and I just like. Don't want to live anymore because literally nothing good happens for me. Nothing. I can work harder than anyone else and yet somehow I get nowhere. Or I go a few feet and then get drug back by some stupid crisis taking place.

I was at a 4 year university for a little while, not sure what I wanted to do. However, I eventually wasn't able to pay for it anymore. That worked out though because I finally figured out what I wanted to do, and I could get it done at a community College online! (I want to get my degree in Mortuary Science, which my previous 4 year university did not offer). I came to this conclusion in the fall of 2019. I realized I had to pay my previous school what I owed them- once I did that I could buy a transcript, transfer, and start classes! My payment plan was small, $100/month, since I don't make a lot of money. But I was slowly chipping it away.
Then the pandemic hit and I lost my job.

I finally have started to get back into a consistent job job good hours, but now there are late fees piled on top of what I owe. I'm panicking because I got accepted at the community College, and I have financial aid that will pay for the classes- but I cant use any of it to pay the 4 year university, so I can't get a transcript, so I can't register for my proper classes yet. I'm trying to pay wjat what can, but time is running out and again I can only pay so much since I don't make a lot. If I get a private student loan I believe it's the same problem where I wouldn't receive the funds until the semester began, and I wouldn't have registered for classes because I couldn't send a transcript. I tried applying for a personal loan and got denied.

I am 19 almost 20 and I am a Sophomore in College (Go Owls: FAU) I been at home since the pandemic (graduated HS in 2020 and then started college soon after virtual) and home life has been worsening significantly and I don't know what to do at all and I been at my wits both emotionally and mentally since I feel trapped, I feel useless, I feel sad bc I'm always being compared to by other ppl or my older sibling, I feel un heard and not being respected or listen to at all, and expectations set for me is unreasonable or if I somehow achieve it then parents back track/change their minds or make me feel like shit or vice versa.

I suspected I have a learning disability (ADHD &amp; Potentially Autism Scale) more than what limited information I know about my Speech and Language Disorder (which family never give a fuck about and usually be by myself in my IEP Meetings in HS) and my accommodations from HS bc of S&amp;L Disorder didn't transfer since my college requires a documentation from a Therapist &amp; Psychologist to which idk where to even begin since I'm all on my own and barley have any money. My close friends that I talk to about this also suspected that I have Depression, Anxiety and maybe even Bipolar (Ma is suspected to have it since she is crazy as hell and they want me to be tested bc genetics is a lovely thing, and don't want me to be off guard even tho haven't shown signs of it) but like what I need for accommodations for college I don't know where to even begin since this is overwhelming and I am afraid of not being able to tackle those issues or just continuing to deal with it ""on my own"" or be silent as usual 

I already applied and got accepted for single dorm housing on campus (have 2 or 3 roommates, originally 3 but one drop and is vacant but its a 4 bedroom housing where we share 2 bathrooms and have a private bedroom) with a 12 meal a week food plan for the upcoming Fall semester but I'm afraid, one because haven't told parents and don't drive (have permit since end of sophomore year in HS via driver's ed class after much hell in doing so, but need practice and anxious of driving both from parents yelling first then teach, Ma telling me I stole or mess up something in her car [isn't true bc I don't take from my own parents in terms of valuable stuff, things like gum or food yea but never money or what Ma accused me of taking or screwing up when I drive in her car] or me being Black and Femme lending NB) nor own a car and two, I'm anxious they just guilt me in staying and I be more stuck then ever. I'm tired of being so useless, I'm trying to stay steady for my friends and even tho my parents (more so my Ma since she calls me worthless and hopes stuff happen to me while Dad is passive and always working 2 jobs, he's a hard worker but hes strict and traditional, always goes with what Ma says even when she's wrong and then always making me have to apologize even when Ma as usual go past my boundaries or make me feel like I would be better off dead instead of adding onto the bill by living here) besides Dad I guess and maybe my older brother (don't have a good relationship but not as bad as Ma just neutral) prob would be happy if anything happens to me

I'm all on my own and idk how to do much in terms of being an adult. I know how to separate clothes and put them in the dryer then fold them as well as ironing but I never start a washer machine (at best Ik the soap and detergent stuff goes but dk like water temperature and which is the best setting for the type of clothes) my cooking skills is microwave or things that are simple since all my life my family made cleaning and cooking a ""female"" job and I reject that bc it was so stupid growing up seeing my Ma cook and what not then be pissed when I don't do so but when my brother does she says that he can stop and she wants me. Yea ik it bite me in the ass but I don't like being told I have to do something just bc I have a uterus, not to mention at least for this semester, we don't have a stove in the housing dorm and only a community housing kitchen in one of the floors. I know how to wash, put away and start a dish washer, swept the house and clean the bathroom but not sure if I need to learn more skills that I'm just either blankin out, never taught/get frighten by being told to go away and don't learn or vice versa

Idk what to do in terms of clothing or hair since one, a lot of clothes in my closet needs major updating since I detested the clothes I wear (a good 85% don't match what I want nor gender identity) and also shopping bc Ma always had to start something or when I get something she later takes it either bc she is upset or when I used to have report cards in K-12 whenever it didn't met her expectations it would get taken away same with birthday or Christmas gifts then takes it long enough she regifts it and me being a dummy I lowkey forgot about it so I get excited for the same stuff twice. Then bonus pts for Ma in comparing me with my older brother or other ppl who did better than me. I want to cut my hair bc I heard the symbolism that cutting your hair means change but I want something low maintenance that I be able to embrace my Haitian &amp; Black Ethnicity as well as learning how to manage my 4c Texture Hair since I am a newbie and dk the products nor braiding to do on myself (I tried on my childhood doll but I just keep on messing up and got sad so I just figured I'ma always have to pay or deal with my hair on my own). Once again I do not know how to go about this so I feel trapped and discouraged already

I don't know how to pack for dorms and not even sure if family would help me without it being a battle or worse make me cancel my housing and then depend on Ma to drive 45 min to and from college. I tried to compromise and said Tri Rail, Ride Sharing with a Friend or Apps, or Bus, parents said no and said that I have to depend on Ma since Dad always working and I don't want to do that both bc even tho I'm so behind in being an adult (*Sniffles*) 

I'm trying even tho I need guidance without being yelled at or hurt or overstimulated (being yelled at by different ppl is a good way or that party noise thingy you blow is also another way to cause me to react) and that I want space, I need air and I need help both for myself to be in a better place so I can live life beyond always being at home and always doing school (which is harder with no accommodations, being in a unsupportive household, indirectly being attacked on my gender and sexuality even tho haven't been out [Religious parents but usually Ma for this], classes isn't interesting and want to take classes that means something like major classes or classes that is more helpful than a General Ed Class can give hence the distractions but just have to force myself to work through it but its becoming harder to do so than b4) never hanging with friends or talkin on the phone (I was on a phone with a friend I haven't spoken to well besides text that is since the pandemic started then my Dad yell at me for being on the phone and then told me to do something Ma wanted me to do, it was to close the TV [Bruh] and then after that Ma told me all I do is eat, shit, be on my laptop/phone and sleep, then proceeds to attack and belittle me) or just have the freedom, the confidence and at ease to be a almost 20 year old in college.

I need help and in Mid August thats when move in day for my college begins (don't have an exact date yet) and I really dk where to begin so I can have a better year in college (I started off ok in Fall and Spring with a 3.52 GPA but then my summer classes kick my ass badly and I ended up withdrawing from a class [during add and drop week for 2nd half of summer thankfully] failing 3 classes (1 class but Canvas divides the 3 credit class into lecture and lab so that's technically 2) then Accounting 1 kick my ass (have to retake it in the Fall bc its required for a business major) bc of our Douchebag prof. The only class I manage to pass was Micro with a C which I'm upset on bc Ik I could have gotten an A but bc of me feeling more discouraged, feeling depressed, I just barley pull through and I feel so freaking guilty about it enough that I'm like bawling in my room for a week and a half privately as I hear in the background how worthless I am and a waste of space by Ma. 

Dad is always working and then whenever he does see me he just be upset at me and always makes me be around Ma 24/7 or told me that have some knowledge do something with my life or act like I have sense or be smart and whenever I do try like telling my parents about this Part Time Job in Mid April, about 10 min away from my house, my folks laugh in my face and then when I get to tell them the bonus of having 1,500 in money after a certain amount of time on the job, they told me to take my ass to CVS/Walgreens (Dad wants me to work in Medical as a first job and in a clean environment even tho I did and got rejected or never call back to which Dad pointed out the other ppl younger than me and made me feel like shit when he told me ""How come I can't be like them"" then told me to try again even tho we in like the worst job unemployment of our time like its so simple, I had so much tears whenever I eagerly open up a email from a job then get crushed when as usual don't get picked or saying their hold my file, told Dad and he says to try harder and stop making excuses and that I'ma feel it when I'm older don't want to do anything with my life) then being told I'm lucky I don't be hired and then fired in the same day.

Ma told me if I was a cart pusher like in the groccery store she would not even bat an eye to me and Dad has this expectations of me working in medical and clean which funny enough the job, Uniform Advantage fit everything that Dad wanted and a bonus it was in business something that I'm actually majoring in but parents never remember and still salty I'm not in Nursing in terms of a major. Hell, my Ma until recently used to lie to my other family members on how I went to other college and taking another major and don't even freakin acknowledge what I'm in and always as usual boast about how great and awesome my older brother is. I hate being told I'm not good enough, yes I freakin know it for years now, u don't have to repeat something I already know. And Dad for the longest time was pissed that I stand up to him and told him I don't want to be in nursing (For Haitian Kids we only got 6 career paths, Basketball or Football, Doctor, Nurse, Lawyer &amp; Engineer when a kid go against that parents flips their shit bc they want a kid to have a stable and known career with bonus pts of bragging rights ofc) and wanted to be in Health Administration/Human Resources and overall Business Aspect, he told me I'ma regret it and even now still feel like shit for standing up and making him upset but I guess its one of the many things I can't just help in making my parents upset about.

Anyways continuing on, when I told my Dad when we went out to shop for food a few weeks back the store and where its at, Dad told me no then when I ask him why he told me its not medical, I reply back its a medical business that sells Scrubs for medical professionals like nurses and assistants, then he told me to apply to CVS and Walgreens which I told him why I can't as explain earlier, then he told me to apply to T-Mobile, I asked Dad in confusion how the heck T-Mobile is medical unless I missed a huge memo that T-Mobile sells Medical Devices instead of phones idk how its medical. I love my Dad but damn it he be contradicting himself and then he tells me I'm being disrespectful whenever I talk back or ask for clarification (hence I be silent and stay confused a lot leading me to get yelled at a lot since idk what I was being asked and when I ask for clarification I get told to have some sense and to figure it out) but anyways he told me that T-Mobile was clean and I legit had to fight off the urge to freakin face palm at this tho like omg Jesus Christ take the wheel.

I just need help, in terms of getting my life together and myself once I'm on campus if by some freakin miracle Parents don't start shit or make me feel like shit and guilt me into canceling the housing contract. I need a part time job to start saving for Study Abroad which I want to do in Spring 2023 and Fall of 2023 of Junior year to Australia, I need money and I don't want to depend on family more than I already have to (ex: that stupid FAFSA) and not to mention it already hurts like mf hell to take out loans for Housing which I still owe even with with loans (sub and unsubsidized loans from FAFSA) and maximum Pell Grant, I need to pay a lil over 750 out of pocket to pay clear off my balance for the fall term and its going to be the same for Spring housing as well. 

The area near my college is expensive as hell and I doubt my folks will cosign me an apartment and even if they did where the hell is a college student going to come up with 1700 per month without sacrificing full time college or being in a bad position to pay it off even with roommates its still expensive not to mention I'm not trying to scare off ppl or be afraid or deal with much ppl since I already come from a rough background I do not want to take out loans and want not just to be in the same environment again. I just feel like I'm trapped since I legit choose being in debt which I avoided for the longest then staying at home and being debt free but feel like shit.

I'm scared that my folks is going to be right and I continue to be useless, I'm trying and I feel like I'm drowning in not being able to function correctly for not being like other ppl my age is doing, I'm just tired of being this way, I didn't ask for this, to be this complicated, to be always being in pain, too hopeful, too optimistic even when hurt, too always being slow and useless, I just don't know how to feel at all anymore

I think this is a good stopping point, there is plenty I could say about my family, but I think y'all can have an idea, I just need some help with dealing with Extreme Helicopter and Toxic (more so Ma but Dad has his moments) parents with impossible expectations and making me feel like no matter how much I try I can never do it, I just end up wasting everyone's time just like what Ma always tells me. I need help with this college stuff as well, I just need help with a lot and stop feeling like I'm drowning.

Even with Ma harsh words and Dad's critical and passive, I don't hate them, I should when it comes to my Mother at least, I still have a few decent memories on whenever Ma is not being a bitch or breakin me further on how she used to be proud on when I do something like she still keep that hand print I did in 1st grade as a Mother's day gift its on the counter of her bathroom, but even with the good memories I still have on her, it doesn't replace her words or actions in the present or rather previous actions and it hurts like hell so much. I be lying if I say I'm not effected by Mother anymore, that I don't constantly wish for her to change or it be back to where it used to, that I secretly envy the ppl that had understanding and great parents. 

Yea I have a roof over my head, food on the table, a bed and then clothes but that's not enough. I don't feel supported, I feel like I'm an inconvenience, I feel like I'm here bc I have to be, I feel like I'm not living a life and its just a endless cycle that I can't escape from, I feel guilty for feeling like this since ppl have it way worse than I do, I feel like my feelings don't matter and that it's ok I'm being treated like this since for the longest time I thought (and still is even when friends told me it isn't) was normal, I been told my feelings don't matter (Mother) or idk what stress is since idk how to work and I'm a piece of shit (Mother again) so idk where to even go about for this at all, need advice please and thank you",college,How Does One Improve Their Life After Leaving Toxic Helicopter Parents Household (Well Trying Too) For College (Sophomore),https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/obx13y/how_does_one_improve_their_life_after_leaving/,1625197063.0
187,ThrowawayPleaseYes,1625133235,/r/college/comments/obigw1/how_do_i_tell_my_parents_that_im_on_academic/,"I received a message from my school roughly a week ago informing me that I'm on academic probation for GPA reasons (I had a ~1.8 last semester, but was okay for overall GPA+credit progress). I'm about to start my junior year and am still on track to get my degree on time. My parents pay for my education, so I feel uncomfortable not informing them about this. I distracted them when grades first came out at the start of the month, so they never asked how my classes went. 

I'm currently taking summer courses in order to ensure that I stay on schedule (failed the most important prerequisite class for my major the semester before and it wasn't offered again until this summer). My parents are aware that I have failed classes, but have no idea that I'm on academic probation. They keep floating the idea of me getting a job this summer, and I explained that's a bad idea. My school only allows people to take this course 3 times. I'm on attempt 2/3. My fall schedule would also be ruined if I failed it (it is a prerequisite for over half of the courses I'm signed up for). 

I need them to understand that I need to focus on my classes, but I am not sure how to avoid their anger about my grades. I don't have an excuse for my poor grades since I never saw any of my friends the entire semester, took simple courses, and did the minimum amount of credits to be considered full time(lightest course load I have had so far).

Because I am not a resident of Edinburgh I will have to pay overseas fees despite having a British passport, which scale to around 30,000$ every year across four years. Additionally, I will have to manage a minimum wage job to afford accommodation. Assuming I can sustain a job while I attend the school I will likely be more than 120,000$ in debt by graduation if I do not start immediately paying the incurring interest. 

An argument from my dad is that debt is normal and that taking it on is reasonable if you can capitalize upon it to enable future progress, like an investment that, with effort and diligence, should eventually pay off. Conversely, my teacher tells me that community college is not a bad idea if I am struggling with the thought of paying debt for so long (no good state schools in my current location). However, I am worried that I won't know what to study because Scottish law is significantly different than any course offered at my community college. All of my friends at school managed to receive hefty scholarships for prestigious out-of-state schools so I feel lost at the moment without a modern model to follow.

My initial plan was to graduate from Edinburgh, spend a few years familiarizing myself with a job in Scottish Law, then take a conversion course for a higher salary at a London firm if I am not making enough. However, there are a variety of possibilities like that I struggle to balance school and a job, I can't find a job, or I might not make enough at all to feel like paying off the debt is comfortable as I can't find much consistent information on average Edinburgh University Law graduate salaries (although the university's rankings state that they produce some of the most employable graduates in the world). 

I'm dangling over two extremes trying to figure out what path is the best for me. Although community college is more affordable, I wouldn't know what to study and I wouldn't nearly as enjoy the future options it enables (because I am too bad at STEM subjects to pursue a degree in that field).

University was... fine I think, but I didn't get to enjoy it, first, all my first friends I met while my first semesters graduated 3 years before me, second, I've never got to spend or bond with any of my classmates cus I was constantly being left behind since I couldn't afford a full semester, so I had new people every semester. Third, since I had to work to pay for my studies I never got into any group, sport or club, I just got to the building, had my classes, then left to work, get home from work, study/homework and rinse and repeat, and since I had a scholarship I needed to mantain I studied way too much, no parties and actually got anxiety from those tests (I puked every morning during exams).

I wouldn't say my university was miserable, but I just didn't really enjoy it as much as other people, it was an okay experience that I do not really feel excited talking about, and I graduated a year ago already, meaning that I do not feel like I just finished, I feel there's nothing to celebrate. I've been working and I feel like I left university behind a while ago. I'm hesitating to go since I wouldn't want to risk my parents getting COVID, neither I would feel joy or excitement, I know it is important for some people but not for me. Also,it's important to note that since I paid for my university I shoudln't feel obligated to go because of my parents, and my dad kinda agrees that it is a meh experience, my mom never graduated.

\- I feel like it is a fake graduation, since I've been already working, it feels like a ""yes, take this event so you can't say you didn't get one..."", also with all the COVID restrictions all the photos will be without any real hugs and with a mask, I'm not against COVID restrictions, it's just that I do not want to be remembered as the COVID generation...

192,NarrativeCurious,1624511562,/r/college/comments/o6u6c0/should_i_drop_an_intensive_summer_course_with_two/,"Hello everyone,


I am a senior taking my last two college courses. I was fortunate to get a scholarship that paid for my last two courses. I am short two credits and need one gen-ed.

I am taking two intensive courses and work 20 hours on top (to support myself). It's too much and I'm sad &amp; frustrated. 
I took the course to use the scholarship (limited applicable things), but it's ruining my summer and, honestly, my drive for education.

 I get less than 5 hours a day, don't have time to eat, the class is 4 hours on zoom a day, and I don't feel like I'm really learning anything. Today, I hit a breaking point - I literally fell asleep at work and at class and then fell back to sleep after work. As I type this now, I have to write two more essays and do another project for the course. I failed my exam. 

I recently learned I can actually test out the gen-ed without the course (apparently I already had a high enough skill level prior to signing for the course... I'm frustrated cause I didn't know this before hand and would have never signed up if I knew this). 

Also, though I do need two more courses to graduate, I am in the process of completing an incomplete I had on my transcript. With the incomplete finished, I only need one credit (which the other course I am taking covers! I love this other course and enjoy my time there). 

I feel really bad because it's a prestigious scholarship and I'm failing the course, but I can't just quit work. I also don't need the class really. I broke down crying twice cause I can't keep up. I've tried working with the professor, but there is only so much time in a day &amp; it's an intensive class. The issue is also that I'll have to drain a good portion of my savings to stay debt free and pay back the scholarship as needed. 


BUT! There is only two weeks left (30 hrs). If I can raise my grad to a D, which I think I can do if I take some vacation days + miss some assignments in my other course (I have an A in that one), I'll get the credit and won't need to reach out to the scholarship about the ramifications of failing (F). 

Bonus: the course has also made me distain the topic and I don't want to touch it again with a ten-foot poll. 

Also, I have no worries about job or graduate school. I already got in and I just need to graduate (fully paid masters program). They said I just need to make sure my GPA doesn't drop below a 3.0 in total (and I have a 3.62 now, so one course won't cause an issue). 
-----

Tl;dr: I have a course that is straining my mental health and physical health. I have to work and have another course. I learned I don't need the course to graduate, but there is only two weeks left. I have a scholarship tied to the course which I think I'll have to pay back if I drop &amp; get a W. I already got into graduate school and just need to graduate.

Advice? Help?

193,oozak9,1623726828,/r/college/comments/o04bve/dropped_out_2_years_ago_but_want_to_go_back_to/,"Hello everyone,

I studied in the UCLA film program for 2yrs but dropped out for financial and personal issues. I spent another two years working as a 3D printing teacher in a HS in Korea and I have now realized that I want to pursue a degree in EE or CS. I am currently self-studying programming and math, and I'm enjoying it a lot.

A big issue is that I failed a class right before dropping out, so my GPA dropped from 3.7 to 3.37. Another issue is out-of-state tuition cost. If I go back to UCLA, I plan to move to Cali and work for a year to get in state tuition, but there goes another year of my life. If I transfer, I'm going to have to go to a cheap school or apply for a transfer scholarship, but I don't know if that's possible with that GPA. I really can't afford to take out any more loans.

Here's what I think I can do:

1. Change majors - Go back to UCLA and petition to change majors to engineering. But it's almost impossible to change majors into their engineering school, especially with that GPA, and I did not take ANY math classes.
2. Transfer after fixing grades - go back to UCLA, pay out-of-state for one semester, take some math classes, retake the class I failed, and fix my GPA. Then transfer to another engineering school in the US.
3. Just transfer right now to another engineering college and explain my personal story. Again, I didn't take any math classes and my GPA is poor.
4. Start fresh - apply to another college as a freshman. I am totally okay with doing this, and it also seems like there will be more scholarship opportunity. If I have to retake the SAT, I am good with that as well. Obviously I'll have to omit the fact I went to UCLA.
5. Start fresh at an engineering school in Seoul, Korea. I am here now, and I've heard it's easy for foreigners to get into top schools. This might be best, because college is basically free if you do well.
6. Go to cheap community college, fix some grades, and transfer out.

I honestly don't know what to do in this situation and whether there are more options that I'm missing. I would love for some input and also any advice in general with this situation. Which plan might work best?

TLDR - Went to UCLA for 2yrs as a film major, dropped out for another 2rs, want to go back to school as an engineering major, but have a suboptimal GPA.

I also need to know whether or not I'll have to take the SAT/ACT, I imagine I will bc I'm Class of 2023?

\-Co founder of youth activist org in my city, am senior member and help lead one of our committees. We have over 2,000 followers on Instagram and planned protests last summer/plan protests. Have had some drama w one or two org members which made me consider quitting but I have ultimately decided that I actually, def won't. We started our work last summer (summer of 2020.)

\-I am also co-president of our youth activist club that we started at school to ensure we get people volunteer hours and summer opportunities. Started club this yr.

\-Completed Nursing Workshop (that is moreso geared toward college students but they let me in lol) and received a certificate (idk if my parents lost the certificate or not, it was virtual and during COVID so ig I could email the guy and ask for one again...? But I did learn a lot abt nursing)

\-Did track in freshman yr, wasn't able to really go far w it bc of COVID cutting our season short. Didn't do it this yr due to COVID fears. Intend on doing it next yr but might not be able to bc I'll need to be vaccinated and my mom is really weird abt the COVID vaccine, kind of up in the air, I do want to do it though?

\-I was president of BSU this yr but wasn't voted in, was appointed by club advisor. Have decided to not do it next yr even though I was also apart of it in freshman yr just bc there's some resentment there due to having had interpersonal drama w another co-president (due to me doing all of the work) and with our Treasurer, who has always bullied me even though I did her job for her

\-Am a part of summer program Girls Inc, joined it summer before my freshman yr. Have a job shadowing opportunity this summer - opportunities are volunteering at pre-school (which I wanted but might not be able to get bc my mom doesn't want me to get vaccinated,) and journalism opportunity (which I actually really don't want, is it going to kill my like chances?)

\- I want a nursing internship but probs won't be able to get that until next summer :( Everyone said I can't do it this yr bc of COVID

\-Was on racism sub committee appointed by City Council representatives to make suggestions for City Council

\-Am part of Youth Advisory Board, we work with SBHC to teach students about health-related topics. I did it this yr but it's on Mondays and \*might\* conflict w another extracurricular I have for next yr? I did enjoy it this yr and think I want to next yr, I joined this yr but it admittedly felt different than it might normally bc of COVID?

\-I was School Site council rep for my grade this yr, worked w the principal, was voted in by peers

\-Was nominated by BSU club advisor to do something called Martin Luther King Jr. Freedom Center and actually do like attend the meetings? They offer leadership seminars on certain days of the week, it seems interesting and you do it over summers too.

I just graduated high school, am very grateful to have never had to work, and currently have $2500 in my savings account.  This is without any graduation money I may yet receive.  My parents do also pay me for odd jobs/major chores around the house, which is how I currently pay for my insurance and gas.  I'm also selling loads of stuff I don't need and making money from that.  My guess is I will have around $3000+ by the time I move out.

Between scholarships and my college fund, my tuition, fees, room, and meal plan are all covered.  I'll need $1000 for insurance (which I pay every August, I already have enough for August 2021), and even with high gas prices, it costs about $20-25 to fill up my tank.  I probably won't be spending too much on groceries either, thanks to my previously mentioned meal plan.  I also just don't spend a lot of money.  I don't like going out, and if I can't buy it three times, I don't buy it.

I'm not opposed to getting a job, and I will get one next summer for sure (and possibly during school, if my major isn't too overwhelming).  However, it's very difficult to find one right now where I live, so I don't want to go through all the effort if it's not necessary.

My handwriting is terrible (mostly because I write too quickly(, and I can't even read my handwritten notes 80% of the time. I just write them because they help me memorize the material better. When tests come, I just pay attention in class and watch videos (i.e.: Heimler's History for APWH).

I'm guessing that I'll need to change my habits in college, so I've already practiced by taking notes with Google Docs, and I'm very happy with it. I'm not sure what I'll do for handwritten notes since Google Docs doesn't allow me to do that easily.

202,125098124,1620069384,/r/college/comments/n44p8n/trying_to_figure_out_what_to_do/,"Hello folks, sorry for the incoming essay.

Right now I'm a junior working towards a B. A. in History with a minor in Music. Yes, I know, useless major. The full story was that I also had a major in Education, I was going to become a history teacher. Then Covid-19 hit and I lost a required student teaching opportunity because ""essential personnel only"" at schools. This student teaching was required to complete the education program, so for now I've dropped it. This does however leave me in a bit of a hole, since now my upcoming degree is gunna be useless with pretty much no real job prospects, and I don't really have the time to switch in a more useful major or minor.

My father's cancer relapsed recently, it's the third time. Externally, he looks in a lot worse condition than the first two times, and I'm legitimately afraid he won't be around much longer. A bit of a problem since between his job and the family savings (which are nearly dried up now), he's basically bankrolling 3/4 of college for me. I work 25+ hours a week after classes in fast food to help pay for a tiny bit, and I've taken some federal loans for the remainder. Partially because I was an absolute idiot who didn't plan ahead sufficiently for this sort of situation, partially because of a recent rapid grade slump, and partially because I spend so much time outside of school working instead of studying, my GPA is just barely above a 3.0 - so while I'm not in danger of getting kicked out, and I could still apply to some lower-tier graduate programs, I probably can't expect any scholarships or grants to help out.

My greatest fear at this point is that I'm going to graduate and not be able to find a half decent job, and get stuck working fast food for the rest of my life (which doing the math I can just barely manage, I'll just have to kiss any dreams of returning to school or ever having a family goodbye). I know that in order to actually have a chance higher than 0.001% of getting a half decent job, I'm going to need to go back to school. But with family savings literally almost emptied out (we have just barely enough for me to complete senior year), and my father literally breaking down, I don't know if we can do it financially. Plus, just looking at my father barely able to drag himself out of bed every day, coughing and barely able to stand, hurts my heart. As soon as I graduate and I'm no longer a burden on him, I legitimately want him to just take whatever money we've got left in the bank, and just go retire and enjoy life. He's earned it, unlike me. He's got a long list of things he's always wanted to do and places to visit, and he hasn't traveled for a vacation in almost 20 years. 

At the same time, the more I keep going to school, the more I hate it. I know I should count my blessings, being able to attend a fairly highly ranked school with enough savings available to pay through without having to take any loans except federal loans, but as I keep going I find it harder and harder to focus nowadays. Just one year ago I would spend all of my spare time just poring over historical texts and reading as much as I could, history was the one subject that I found joy reading and talking about; I legitimately could spend hours just talking about history. But over the last few months that's all changed. I barely motivate myself to get through the readings required for the next class. My grades are just slipping, and the more time I spend trying to study and work on papers and such, the more frustrated I feel when my grades keep going down. I'm kind of just forcing myself through the hoops at this point. I keep thinking about how my history degree is literally going to be useless in the job market, and that I've spent the last three years doing feck all without any actual result. I can't bear to read any of the stuff I used to. Just last week I took my small collection of history-related books and just dumped it all in the recycling bin. Inside, I've begun to feel resentment against my interest of history; or maybe, I just hate myself in general.

When I was in high school, I had a friend who actually still lives down the street from where I do. He was your classic future ""going places"" kid - really good at music (got into Nationals so you know he's good), tons of connections, a near-perfect high school GPA filled with APs and honors, tons of extra academic awards. He was literally the one kid everyone said was going to be a future lawyer - he was going to make it in life, he would just breeze right through and everything was going to be great. He even got accepted to Harvard. Then in the last two months or so of high school he just suddenly stopped showing up to school. He never ended up going back to school again, never attended graduation, I'm not sure if he even got his high school diploma. He spends his entire day either cooped up in his house staring at the walls of his room, or walking around outside alone for hours. From what I've heard, he doesn't really talk to anyone anymore except his parents, turned down his offer from Harvard, doesn't have anything he does in life (he doesn't even have a job), and pretty much nowadays all he does is exist. I'm scared that I'm turning into him as well, except a lot more slowly. I can barely force myself to go to classes I used to be passionate about, I have no interest in the things I used to enjoy, I no longer really have any goals in my life. Above all, recently I myself have started going for ""short walks"". I tell myself that I'm just going to take half an hour to clear my mind, and a moment later it's been four hours and I've just wasted all of my spare time with no memory of what happened. I legitimately think I'm burning out, and I'm afraid of turning into my neighbor - all promise and potential, but he burnt out of high school and nowadays he's just a ghost that just sort of exists.

Now of course this isn't the place to talk about finding a job; I've already made posts about that elsewhere, so there's that. But I am trying to weigh out my options. When I was 17 and just about to jump into college, I wrote out a path that I wanted to take based on my interests, but didn't think too hard about the other possible paths, or about a backup plan. This time, I'm going to spend some time assessing every single one of my options before I go anywhere, and I'm going to make sure I've crafted at least some sort of backup plan.

After some thought, reflection, and research, here's what I've come up with in terms of options.

Problem 1: Graduate early to save money (useful for future financial emergencies, or early funding for a future return to school if that happens)? Now that I've dropped the education dual major, I'm actually on track to finish almost all of my graduation requirements for my History major and general education. My music minor is already complete, and doing the math it's possible for me to finish up the last requirements and graduate next semester, which would be one semester early and save me 30k (which mathematically I've calculated would be enough for me to barely survive for one year where I live).

1. Graduate early, take the money saved, and roll with it. The pros are that I get to save enough money to survive a year, and I only have to worry about burnout for one more semester, instead of two. The cons are of course I'll have one less semester to fill up with classes to attempt to pad my GPA, so my final GPA will probably be lower than it could be, hurting my chances of getting into a half decent graduate program in the future, or returning for another undergrad degree.
2. Don't graduate early, spend the final semester just padding my GPA with random classes. The pros are that obviously I get to mentally put off the future for another semester, graduate alongside my few friends, maybe get some final happy memories before I face reality, and of course, I get one final semester to attempt to pad my GPA with easier classes which might help if I go for graduate school. But on the flip side, I would need to keep potential burnout at bay for one more semester, and I'd end up with less money and a tiny bit more debt. Also if I screw up and keep burning out, I'll end up with a worse GPA.
3. Put off graduation and basically redo college to get an actually useful degree. This is technically an option, but considering the family's financial concerns and my father's health, as well as my feelings of burnout, this would be incredibly risky. The pro is that I obviously get a more useful degree with actual market value. The downside is that with the finances in such dire shape I'd basically have to bankroll the entire education with private loans, which might end up killing me even more afterwards. Plus, I'm already burning out now, and completely collapsing and turning into my neighbor two years down the line with all these private loans out would literally not only end my life, but also everyone else in my family, with no result. Still, if all my other options are sufficiently stupid ideas, I'm willing to give this a shot; it'll just be a huge gamble with the odds against me.

Problem 2: Go for further education immediately? My GPA as-is won't be good enough for medical school or law school. I have absolutely no interest or knowledge in medicine anyway, so forcing myself through that might just burn me out even more anyway. It's still good enough for some programs at schools with lower rankings, although my grade slump in the last year or so is going to impact how admissions looks at my GPA. Plus, immediately jumping back into school is going to kill me financially, not as much as delaying graduation since I might qualify for more federal funding if I do a master's, but still, I probably won't qualify for scholarships or grants and the family savings are nearly dry. On the other hand, at least I get to dodge reality for a few more years, and I might come out with a more useful degree.

1. Get a Master's in Education, which would be the plan that most closely follows my original dream. With a state school it wouldn't cost too much, so theoretically if my father was alright with it we could make it work without taking too much in loans. Downside is, in my state, we have too many qualified history teachers for open positions, so if I can't somehow beat out the most recent 1:900 ratio that's been reported, I'm going to be back where I am already, but with more debt. Plus, potential burnout.
2. Get a Master's in some historical subject. Unlikely and not a good idea since I'll just get an equally worthless Master's degree, plus burnout potential.
3. Get a Master's in some other subject. It's a possibility, but it will cost a lot of money. Plus burnout potential. Plus my GPA is already too garbage for most of these programs anyway.
4. Apply to a lower-ranked school and go back as an undergrad. I can pray that they'll give me some financial assistance, and theoretically the classes shouldn't grade as harshly maybe. That being said getting a degree from a no-name school might not help very much. Plus burnout potential of course.
5. Do an associate's in some sort of trade. Most of these seem to be in healthcare though, which I have absolutely no interest in, so I might just end up burning out of those too. They do tend to be a lot cheaper, so I might be able to work it financially. In the very worst case, I could just attempt to do some associate's in business administration and just go be a low-paid office clerk. I'd hate the job but it would pay a hell of a lot more than fast food, have mostly reasonable hours, etc.
6. Yolo into an apprenticeship or trade school. Good future potential and an apprenticeship gets me pay. Downside is that I have a leg problem; I can still walk and do some manual labor tasks, I just don't know if I can keep doing it 10 years down the line. Still, man's gotta earn money.
7. Don't go back to school immediately. On the plus side, it gives me a lot of time to reflect and actually figure out what the hell I want to do, and might help with the burnout. In the meantime, I will need to find a job though. If it pays enough, I might be able to save up enough to go back to school. But if all I can get is some minimum wage fast food job, I guess I'll just kiss my future goodbye. Especially since I probably can't expect my parents to pay for my education 5 years down the line.

I want to share a bit of my life with everyone because I want to be able to reach out to someone who's currently having a hard time in their life. I assure you, you are not alone and your cries of help are being heard by me and many others.

Just a bit about me, Im a 2nd year college student currently attending a Cal State University. I have been on the Dean's List twice already and have a GPA of 3.45 ! It may not seem much to some people but I am insanely proud of where I am now. I could write a book about my experiences if I could, lol. I've had alot of my trust be put into jeopardy and people lie yo me constantly.  

I constantly told myself life would be easier if I didn't have so many health problems. I have a kidney disease, had two spinal surgeries (for scoliosis), asthma, and a bit of an esting disorder. I've suffered from all of this since I was born and I had to experience my high school and middle school to the best of my ability. I had my spinal surgery during middle school during 8th grade. I had to be put into home schooling to recover and when I tried to go back to school, i couldn't keep up with the workload because of the severe pains I was having. It tore apart my education and as an honors roll student I was so devastated. At the same time, one of my teachers would bully me. Telling me to go home and that I was too weak. She excluded me from potentionally life-saving educational opportunities that could have really helped me. She picked her favorite students and guided them towards their college goals while I was left wondering if she really liked me. I became severly depressed because of this.

I lost all my friends because I stopped showing up to school and they simply just stopped talking to me. They also made fun of my health conditions so yeah fuck them. I had to go to therapy because I was contemplating suicide and was so afraid to return back to school and face these teachers who said awful things to me. I was very shy and timid and was always taught never to raise my voice at my teachers so of course I stayed quiet about it. Until I broke down crying in front of my parents and told them that the teachers weren't giving me an opportunity to catch up on homework and give me the time of day to learn. I was in therapy for about 6 years. 

Then high school came, I was in and out of in-person schooling because of the pains and because I had my 2nd spinal surgery. No one called me up asking if I was okay. I spent my days on twitter, youtube, and tumblr learning how to draw, paint, write, and pretty much everything I could ever do. My home schooling teachers were absolute shit, they weren't even my teachers they just dropped off my school work and left lol. I had to teach myself Algebra 2 using just the book. I felt fucking stupid, but despite everything I still got honors roll. I complained about the discrimmination of students with health disqabilities to my high school and they ignored me. I would pass out in the hallways and the next day Id show up half dead because I dragged my ass to English class. The teachers would call me lazy and tell me I wasn't doing enough.

I wondered if anyone really understood the pain I was going through. Having to deal with depression and schooling at the same time was no joke. I unfortunately had severe anxiety and if my grade dropped lower than a C i would cry and pass out. I taught myself Math, History, English, literally everything in the fucking world. Because the support the school offered wasn't enough, when I asked for AP home schooling classes they denied me. I ended up being rejected from most Cal States and UCs because of that. I was so angry and frustrated, i felt humiliated in front of my peers. My Class Year had a 65% acceptance to UCs average. I felt completely lost.  The people I used to call my friends were attending Columbia, UCSB, UCLA, UCI. I cried so hard, it was impossible for me to feel better. 

Then I devised a plan to transfer to a UC in the future after spensing 2 years at a university. I entered the only Cal State that accepted me (I kind of regret it lol) and set the path towards my goal to transfer out. I wish someone in high school had informed me that I could have gone to community college and used TAG (transfeer admission guarantee). I had no idea that existed. My high school failed me big time. I guided myself where I went in life. I cried so many nights, and had no one to talk to. I felt compeltely alone and the help of my family wasn't much better either.

I've been volunteering as an ambassador for a charity for 12 years. (Not anymore) They took advantage of me when they tried to use me as a tax relief deposit in my first year of uni. They gifted me a BMW thst ended up being dog-shit. Like literally 250k miles, a bad motor, and a bad battery. And they wrote it off as a 5k gift to me in a tax form. I felt completrly betrayed but thsn I stood up for myself and refused to accept the car. I just felt so proud of myself for standing up against what they tried to make me do. It fueled me in my college years to keep going strong. I started studying more, looking up sources for CSU TO UC transfer. I still cried alot, but I felt at peace. I still dont have any friends but Im hoping to fix that one day. 

I applied for transfer to all UCs and USC for this Fall Semester 2021. I go waitlisted to UC Davis and UCSC for Political Science and I'm still waiting on UC San Diego and USC. It may not seem like much but the waitlist means the world to me to know that I am capable of going far beyond anyone's words and that my hardwork does pay off. I feel immensely proud of . Cal State Transfers are always last to be picked when it comes to transferring to another four year university so I literally jumped for joy at my odds defying everything I thought of previously. I feel like I can do anything. 

My parents were extremely toxic at some points and supportive in others. They have seen how much I suffered and I only hope with time they will realize that everything I've worked hard on happens for a reason. 

My depression and anxiety still exist, but I am hay to say I no longer feel that gut wrenching voice asking me if I even have a will to live. I still get severe panic attacks when I think about my rejection letters. I look back at my high school and middle school life and wish I was brave enough to face against the people who hurt me the most. I always promise myself that I will get past my hardships and hope to overcome everything I've suffered from.

Despite the lonely nights where I wish I had friends to play Valorant with or go to the movies with. I know maybe someday, i'll meet people who treat me nicely and support me. There's alot of paths I wish I took differently, but I can't change the past. I can only look toward my future. I know that life can be tough and you don't see yourself living past a certain point but everything gets easier with time. You don't need anyone but yourself to tell you that you're an amazing person and that you're capable of great things. You are an exceptional human being with great qualities and just because someone tells you something differently does not change the feelings you have for yourself. Your ambition is strong and it will drive you great places. 

No matter where you end up in life and if you decide to drop out, or continue your education. You are important and self-love matters. You deserve everything good in the world.",college,"I Found my Better Future and You will Find Yours Too (20, F )",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/n10o6a/i_found_my_better_future_and_you_will_find_yours/,1619706377.0
204,levi_v9,1619518755,/r/college/comments/mzla73/nonverbal_learning_disorder/,"Hey, I'm 27 and I have been diagnosed with ADHD for awhile now. I do take a med for it that does help quite a bit, and the ADHD explains some of my behavior. However though, I was speaking with someone about other problems that ADHD doesn't quite fit the bill for, and they suggested I look into non-verbal learning disability. Which, I did and I have quite a bit of the most common symptoms that are listed, and explains a lot more about my behavior that makes more of a full picture for me. What I have trouble with specifically, is teaching myself something. So, whenever I get interested in something, I put a bit of time in to learning it and practicing it, but I get to a point where any knowledge above beginner level just goes right over my head, and I give up. I ALWAYS need someone else to explain something to me that I don't understand by myself. And this is for things like chess, playing drums, guitar, painting, drawing, photo editing, fitness, etc. For example, in chess, I started out around 600 rating, and I learned the basics and a few openings, and I got up to 900 rating. But when I tried to learn more strategy to get above that level, I just cannot learn any of it by myself, so I give up and never touch it again. Even youtube videos don't really do anything for me, I have to have it explained to me in words like in person or in real time over an online platform, such as in voice chats like in Overwatch, or on discord, etc. This is a real problem and has repeated itself over anything I have been interested in doing or learning as a hobby. For school I do have accommodations set up for my ADHD which do help, so I'm not worried about that as much as I am for when I want to learn something that I don't have the time or money for to pay to take classes in, like the subjects I listed above. I was just wondering if anyone has experienced this at all and how you have dealt with it, specifically the teaching yourself part, because I can't just pick up a book and have the attention span to sit there and read, and then retain the info.

Three colleges that I applied to recently got back to me saying I wouldn't be accepted because I dropped out of uni (2016) and cannot get transcripts from them to ""transfer"". One school even said I couldn't even start as a freshman!

I can't get the transcript because I haven't fully paid owed tuition. While I was still a student, I managed to pay half ($23,000) but still owed about $20,000 by the end of the year. I couldn't pay before summer was over and I don't have credit for a loan, so I agreed to do monthly payments. The uni wouldn't let me back in until my debt was paid, regardless of me promising to pay. So I had to drop out. 

Eventually, I lost the ability to pay the $400/month to the university, so they sent my bill to collections. So *technically*, I don't owe the school, I owe some company. 

Fast-forward to now, I'm being told that despite all this, I still can't start as an undergrad. I don't have great credit, working on it but it's hard when you're born into a bad financial situation. AnyWAY! I wanna get a 4-year degree, like legit will study anything, I don't care, I just want a job that can pay my bills!

I know it is early to worry about this but the earlier I get this sorted out the better. My parents are incredibly (like, insanely) religious and won't allow me to attend a secular college or else they will not pay. I've been at an extremely religious all girls private school my whole life and I'd honestly rather work at McDonalds for the rest of my life than go to a another teeny religious all girls school for college. There's less than five people in my entire grade and none are going to college, or theyre going to seminary and then a religious college. 

My absolute dream is to study abroad specifically in the UK either England or Scotland. I am in California. Tbh, I know it's crazy for my situation and maybe unrealistic but I just want it so badly. From what I'm looking at, tuition costs are ranging from about 21k-27k per year there. There are a few scholarships but not many, if I can manage to get one or two I can hopefully save a couple thousand dollars. 

My parents make a good amount and could easily pay 4 years of any college without aid if they wanted to--but they don't and won't. So I don't know how I can apply for need-based scholarships or aid because they will be able to see my parents make a lot even though they're not even going to give any to me.

According to the university websites, expenses are due in full before you begin the term. 

I plan on working in college, definitely. However how would I pay the expenses in full before?? I think taking a loan is the most reasonable option here but I'm not sure at all how that works. I don't have any credit history. And is it not worth it to get a loan? This is just my dream and either way I will DEFINITELY not be staying at home when highschool is over. I don't want to at all and I can't imagine that. 

 I don't know what to do. ugh. I'd ask a college counselor, but, my school doesn't have one...

(please don't tell me 'just go to school in state'. Either way, the cost for that is a problem as well and I know it is an option but I want to see if I can make this studying abroad thing work out first. Also, yes, I'm just a junior, I'm aware.)",college,So... how do you afford college abroad without getting a single dollar from your parents?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/mui7wd/so_how_do_you_afford_college_abroad_without/,1618909390.0
208,HTMLBattles,1618507638,/r/college/comments/mrjk11/it_makes_me_sad_to_see_so_many_people_willing_to/,"I've got a bit of a pity story that will get me to my point.

When I was a teenager, my mom married a man who made a lot of money. It was great for her, but it kind of tripped me. I didn't have college savings as we were in and out of poverty for all of my life, and he said he wasn't going to pay for my college which is completely understandable. I don't know why he would. When it came time to fill out FAFSA years later, I learned that it lined up perfectly with my mom's taxes being filed jointly. I was not eligible for financial assistance from the government. Due to my mom's credit score and my lack of credit history, I wasn't eligible for private loans either.

I ended up going to a cheap school I could afford to pay out of pocket, but again my financial situation changed and I had to drop out. I worked shit jobs make shit wages for 10 hours a day sometimes every day and I was technically homeless but fortunate to have someone let me stay with them until I could afford rent.

Now it's about 5 years later and I am eligible for full financial assistance, covering 100% of the cost of tuition but not living expenses. God damn is it a blessing. I cried a fucking lot after supplying my FAFSA info and getting enrolled.

It makes me so sad that people who are already in college, and already have the means to finish just want to quit. Don't.

Yes, it's unfair we have to put ourselves into debt. Yes, it's unfair schools don't give a shit about you and your mental and physical health. Yes, it's unfair schools are charging you just as much for unprepared and disorganized online classes as they would for in-person classes during a pandemic and using the money to line pockets and spend it on sports.

Yeah, it fucking sucks, but what would be the point in waiting for it to get fixed first? You're more than likely going to find yourself in a shittier situation if you stop, and I'm just going to say it gets 1000x harder to go to school if you decide to go back later because you have bills you didn't have in college, so you have to work full time and go to school full time. It's nearly impossible to eat and sleep regularly, and there's a high chance you can't do school from your work. I can, and I am so thankful for that, but that's rarely going to be the case.

Stay in school. This is an opportunity that 2/3 of the US doesn't get, but you're already here. Why squander that? It's only 4 years, and it's going to be the fastest 4 years of your life.

P.S. your school more than likely offers mental health services. That was a huge help my first attempt in college, and they gave me therapy and medication during my time there. Take advantage of that. It's literally never going to be cheaper to seek mental health help under our current system.",college,It makes me sad to see so many people willing to just quit college in this subreddit for non-financial reasons.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/mrjk11/it_makes_me_sad_to_see_so_many_people_willing_to/,1618525638.0
209,throwaway43643442324,1618468671,/r/college/comments/mr962t/why_keep_going/,"Title. I don't see a reason for trying in school anymore, and to a broader extent life itself. The burnout, indifference to learning, not retaining what I learn, etc. is too much. I think I hate my major. I just want to do media editing, but am trapped in these bullshit prerequisite courses where I learn all these boring things about film theory and social justice that don't relate to it. I need to get through these courses to get to the upper division editing ones, and fuck me I don't even know if I'll like them once I get there. I don't want to direct student films, or work alongside exhausting student creatives/auteurs, or pick up a million unrelated, unpaid internships just to stay competitive in the job market, but my degree basically demands it. I guess I owe this all to my shitty planning...well, that and college is a scam. I wish someone warned me.

So, I have to get so far into my major to actually experience classes I might like, and if I don't, then switching majors from that point on will be a massive waste of time and money I don't have. No realistic backup major or anything of course, unless I'm prepared to go hungry. And that's just college; I'm so fucking unprepared for the real world. It takes all the effort I can muster just to get all As in classes, and every few days I give up on having a work ethic. I've got nothing else. There's no positives in my life anymore, and if there's no positives, why keep going? Tell me, I legitimately need some reasons to not take the easy way out of this bullshit. This post is just me narrowing down if there are some left. Don't post that dumbass suicide hotline, it's intensely unhelpful, almost makes me want to do it out of spite. How do you keep going?

But first, please don't bother with the ""it will get better"" pep talk. That's a lie people have been telling me for ~10 years now and I hate it. I'm downright resentful of it. I was told college is so much better than high school, then went into easy but unfulfilling and lonely community college. I've now transferred into my university and spent 2 semesters of painful Zoom U here. I've set foot on the campus once. My school's mostly back to normal next semester, but because I've been absorbed by the amorphous blob-like thing called online school I don't know if I can adapt.

My peace of mind is ruined; Physical classes means I'll have to commute to them. What are the three most nerve-wracking activities I've ever experienced? Driving in general; people are assholes, working shitty retail to pay for my insurance, and stressing through all the errands my mom will inevitably heap on me.

My sleeping schedule is ruined; how the fuck do I adjust to early classes after a year of asynchronous ones.

My study habits are ruined; I can't imagine memorizing things for a test anymore when they've all been open-book for so long. I think online school actually gave me ADHD- my attention span is shot and I can't pay attention to anything. I gave up reading any scholarly articles, i've tried and tried, I just can't. All I have is blind hope that it disappears when physical classes arrive.

My social life is preemptively ruined; Making friends online is and has always been a farce. Everyone's too hesitant and everything feels too awkward. I don't know my school, I don't know kids in my major. I do know I'm not going to have time for socializing and clubs once back because I now know how oppressive the college workload. Never mind that I'm socially stunted to begin with.

I hate online classes with a passion. I want to get away from them, but it's very likely I'm exchanging one shitshow for another by transitioning to physical. Different stressors, same quantity of them. Don't tell me things will get better. I understand as strangers you can't promise me many things with substance behind them, so if you can only post empty encouragement (#wegotthisfam #slayit), I'd rather you just not post anything at all.

Please don't bother to suggest therapy either. I've always been a little suicidal, but until this semester I never felt desperate enough to need therapy for it. What did I find when I looked for help? My school's counseling program has a 50/50 chance of actually helping me, or locking me up in an institution that could only make life more miserable. I can't take those odds. They're always trying to push you out to private therapists anyways.

I looked up those- I was gently told to fuck off by one organization in the consultation call because I couldn't afford the standard 12 weeks of sessions (over ~$1000). Fucksakes, I only wanted a few. Low-cost organizations are happy to have me...if I can wait 3-4 months. I wish they told me to fuck off too, honestly, because it's not like most people desperate enough to seek out therapy can just postpone their problems.

I discovered therapy in the U.S. is as much a joke as our traditional healthcare is: available but too expensive, or inexpensive but always unavailable. It's not an option, for me at least. Finding that out after so, so many people said it's worked wonders for them, hurt. It really hurt.

But, at risk of going beyond subreddit parameters, how do you keep going in life? I like to think I've ""accepted"" that I'll never live up to my unrealistic pipedreams, or that I won't find love, or have my own place, etc. but I still get sad over these things. I don't know what it's like to be content with life, but so many others do and persevere through the bullshit under worse circumstances than me. The reality is, as nobody has ever disproved it to me, is that you hustle and suffer through college, internships, and extracurriculars, just for the chance of a tolerable job and retirement plan. First world problems and all that, but I can't envision living like that. I'd rather not live at all.

211,hsjdk,1617488422,/r/college/comments/mjipg9/offered_two_online_summer_jobs_take_both_or/,"I'm a freshman student at my university and I was offered a paid summer research position by my PI the other week. He's asking for around ten hours of research work per week and I'm assuming it's the same research work that I have been doing for this semester (online data analysis type stuff). I currently do around 9 hours a week for his lab during the semester. I don't have any plans for the summer at the moment and I was thinking of going back to my last summer job anyways if they were still hiring. My PI really likes me in his lab and I enjoy doing the work that I am currently doing (very interesting and also low stress haha) , so I don't have a problem with continuing to do it over the summer, especially if I'm being paid :D

I had an interview for a tutoring job today with an organization whose mission I really agree with, and that went really well. The tutoring job doesn't start until next fall, but the director offered me a position this summer to teach "" extracurricular "" type classes online for their summer study session. The way it was planned out was that around the end of their summer sessions, I could be an instructor for small cultural / global studies introduction classes for the high school students. This would just be over a few weeks, I believe. The director told me I wouldn't have to worry too much about not having enough training for anything, as she will help me through the job. This summer position would just be a few hours of ""teaching"" students over zoom each week. I have quotation marks around teaching because of course, I'm just an undergrad student, I don't actually have a teaching certificate. She pointed out my extensive language skills for being qualified this position though, and I do have confidence in sharing my enthusiasm and cultural knowledge with others, so I think this would be a really fun opportunity!

Should I take both jobs for the summer, or stick with only one of them? I believe both jobs will be online (the tutoring/teaching job is 100% online, and I'm pretty sure the research one will be online as well, but I have a meeting with my PI later next week to talk more about the position), which gives me the ability to consider both instead of just picking one. They both pay about the same amount of money ($12/hour for 10 hours of teaching per week and $13/hour for 10 hours of research per week). I would honestly say that the responsibilities are pretty similar as well, because connecting with high school students ONLINE is a massively engaging task in itself, and then of course, I can't half-ass or slack off being a research assistant because my PI trusts me and thinks very well of me. I don't have a problem with taking both jobs, but I don't know if it's really the ""right"" thing to do because I don't know if I would be putting 100% of my time into each of these responsibilities. I think if I had to choose just one, I would like to do the small teaching job because I think it would be pretty fun and if the future of teaching wasn't so bleak and under-appreciated, I would 110% be going to school for teaching instead. Would it be wrong of me to do agree to both jobs during the summer? Should I be transparent to both the organization director and my PI if I am to do both jobs? I'm pre-med by the way, and both the organization director and the PI of the lab have had many former students successfully match into medical schools, clinical internships, and graduate schools, so I think both opportunities are equally beneficial for my future goals.

tl;dr — I've been offered a paid summer research assistant job with my PI for $13/hour , ten hours a week AND a summer ""teaching"" job with high school students for $12/hour , also ten hours a week . Both positions are online , the pay is pretty much the same , just two different areas of interest. I don't mind the research position but I think the teaching/tutoring position will be more exciting , while the research position will be better for professional school or something in the future .

I want to get all the crap I don't care about out of the way, so I could spend my last year enjoying my time in the studios once they are reopened.

I was not prepared for how this semester is going. 2 of my senior level art history courses (mandatory for my degree) have come crashing down on me. Neither class had a single grade for the first half the semester. One of the classes has a large midterm assignment due. The teacher said we would discuss the project before it was due, so I didn't give it a second thought until she brought it up, but she did not bring it up until the other day, when I found out we were expected to have been working on it the whole semester, and it is due in 11 days. This would be a hard enough task to handle on its own without 3 other courses and a job that also need to be looked after, but it gets worse. the other history professor just gave out our essay topic for our midterm essay which is due next Friday.

Right now, I've got the possibility of going to a few colleges in my state, I've gotten accepted. That being said, I am very middle-upper class so my parents can't afford to pay for college, but my FAFSA is essentially useless because they still make decent money.

On the other hand, I've estimated I could get my associates for  &gt;10k, if not less due to DE and AP credits that I should be able to use.

But the more I read old Reddit posts &amp; whatnot the more confused and concerned I get about transferring. It appears to me that 'guaranteed admissions' is not really a guarantee, because even if you have the stats a school can only accept so many people?

One of the colleges I'd love to go to has a CC guaranteed admissions with my local CC, but then I see forum posts and people say the acceptance rate for transfers is like 5-10%.

Maybe I'm just misunderstanding, or I'm overthinking it. With all this being said, I'm fairly confident I can't afford 4 years of full-on college, nor want to take the debt, so I'll probably do CC either way. Just curious for any advice or knowledge anyone may have.

First off, academically. Back in HS, and even last semester, I did kinda well and basically understood everything (after studying ofc). Now I have no idea what we're even seeing in class. I can no longer pay attention to any of my classes and even when I try to I can't manage to absorb the knowledge. I haven't taken any notes in 2 weeks and my plan for my midterms is to binge all of my classes until I get it. 

Also, homework. I have no energy to do anything whatsoever and I always start doing my assignments as late as possible. I'm just so tired all the time and it's desmotivating knowing that my reward for finishing something is yet more work. 

It doesn't help that I spend most of my time on the corner of my parent's house with a foldable table while they do stuff right around me. 

Socially, I haven't been able to make a single friend yet. I'll admit it, I'm not the most social person out there, but at least I was able to get close to others. Now everyone is just a name on a zoom call. It makes me feel bad, as all through my life I've been told that I'd meet my friends on my starting weeks, hell even first days. 8 months later and nothing. 

It doesn't help that everyone I know is way smarter than me, which makes me feel dumb and useless. Mixed with my pride/anxiety making me unable to ask for help makes it so that the breach keeps growing. 

Some of this stuff was also the case back in HS, but at least there I could like, hang out with people, take a break somewhere, talk to my teachers when I had doubts, etc. Now all I do when I'm not in class is to lie down on my couch and sleep until the next one. I don't feel as if I was in college whatsoever. 

I'm so tired all the time. I haven't had free time in weeks (mainly due to my poor planning skills and the fact that if I do have time I'll just sleep). I just want it to be over. 

I had plans to do bigger things: get a second major, try and go on exchange, etc. But now I don't have any motivation for anything. The only thing keeping me sane is talking to my HS friends from time to time, but that only takes more time away from me and screws me even more. 

Does anyone have any tips or anything? I don't care about what, anything that may help. I just really want for this to be over (or for me to die in a ""tragic"" accident. Either works).

I moved out of state to attend my particular program, but because of the pandemic I can no longer afford my apartment. At this moment I can't even technically afford to pay to break the lease. My FAFSA was actually based on my income when I was working full-time (I was told they don't update this once you reach senior-status) so my federal loans never reflected my actual situation. I opted to learn remotely this semester because of a history of health issues, and am in the process of moving back in with my parents.  


My school has a process where if you are struggling to pay the balance of your tuition, you can fill out an application explaining your situation and they will review it. I sent this to financial aid over three weeks ago. They sent me a reply saying they got it, and then I never heard back. The first monthly payment was due this week, so I contacted the business office to tell them that I was undergoing a review and hadn't heard yet. They told me I still had to pay the balance, I couldn't adjust the due date, and that there would be a late fee if I need more time. Shortly thereafter I checked my financial aid online and it said my balance was paid in full. Then I got an email from the business office saying I was actually going to get a REFUND check.  


This afternoon students got a mass email saying that they accidentally doubled everyone's scholarship amount (why on earth that would ever happen I can't even wager a guess) and that everyone's financial aid info was messed up for a couple days. I called them to ask when I can expect to hear back about the review process, they said they didn't know. I told them that the lack of communication and the clerical goof was something I take very seriously, because I am in a very serious financial situation trying to finish this degree. I told them I don't feel as though the full seriousness of how dire the financial circumstances are for students right now.  


I was told, oh OF COURSE they understand what students are going through. And I was told I did the ""right thing"" by advocating for myself. I'm almost 30 and I felt like I was being spoken to and treated like a kid. Pretty audacious considering you're charging me $30,000 a year.   


An hour and a half later I get an email saying that in response to my financial aid review there's ""no additional funding"" for me. But oh, I can enroll in a monthly payment plan if that helps!  


I know private universities are businesses and the bottom line is all that they really care about. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. But my school began a nearly $100 million apartment/shopping complex last year. And the reimbursement date for tuition has passed, so even if I were to unenroll I would still owe the same amount. I can't help but feel like, they knew I was going to have to cough up this money at some point so why would they help me? My school markets themselves as being an environment of solidarity and a perpetuator of social justice work, which I find sickening when I see how little is being done for students who are still struggling in a pandemic after almost a year.  


Be a private college, keep paying those administrators top dollar, keep watching the money roll in, fine. But don't pretend to care about the financial situation of your students, or about the idea of promoting equity in the world.

The con is, if I attend ODU, I'll have to take out A LOT of loans or a big loan just to pay for the rest of school. 

I'm planning to go to a local community college called John Tyler that has a lot of Guaranteed Admission programs for ODU. Because I have a lot of financial aid, the community college would basically be paid for. Not only that, but at my high school, I took DE classes so that might give me a benefit. The only problem is housing. Since I'm living in a hotel, I don't really have anywhere to go and hotels are expensive(moms paying right now).

If I go to ODU I'll have somewhere to stay along with the scholarship and financial aid. But I still have to take out loans. So what is the best choice? Should I go to community college, get a job, save up money, and then go to ODU? Or should I just go to ODU?",college,I can't make a decision between a University or a Community College.

219,SunbakedChris,1612832673,/r/college/comments/lfqusm/why_do_i_hate_university_so_much/,"I've been going to school for a while now and just transferred to a university. I've had this hatred towards school for a long time but I feel like it has been amplified. I've talked to other people about this and they too also have a hatred towards school but no one else is as passionate about this hatred as I am lol. I've tried hard to stay in school but almost every ounce of me wants to drop out and just start a business or work a blue collar job for the rest of my life. Not to say that there is anything bad with either of those, I just feel like I would enjoy it more. I hate the idea of going to school just to be able to compete for a 9-5 corporate job. I hate how no professor is passionate about teaching their subjects and just offer the same mediocre lesson plans. Not to mention my parents are paying an arm and a leg supporting these institutions and unpassionate professors that, in the grand scheme of things, just want your money. All for a piece of paper that says your capable in what ever field you majored in.

Now I understand that this piece of paper does lead to more success financially because I will admit, for someone of a lower socioeconomic class, going to college will almost guarantee you more money in the long run. This post is not to crap on anyone who is going to college but mentally, I just can't. I need to be passionate about something in order to do good, and what good is it when no one is passionate about the things they teach. I want to better myself financially in life, but it just kills me that the majority of my classes for my major are catered to a corporate/office setting. By no means am I taking a hard major either, (business admin in management). I feel like university kills creativity for me. It's hard for me to pay attention in class. I barely study. Everyone says, ""It's just temporary,"" but I've honestly felt this emotion all my years in school and even more so now.

Not to mention I've never really been given or had any sense of direction on what I wanted to do in life. If I were to drop out right now, I have some ideas on what I could do with my life but my parents would be disappointed in me for dropping out. I hate thinking about it because my parents both grew up in a not so nice areas in South America and took a risk to move to North America to give me and my sibling a better future. I just feel like I'm wasting this opportunity they gave me. On the other hand I literally hate school so much. When I'm out of school I feel more creative, happier, and overall a entrepreneurial person. When I'm in school, I just hate every second of it and become angry and frustrated with life.

225,MindfulRain,1611175128,/r/college/comments/l1hysw/cant_afford_grad_school_and_im_exempt_from_most/,"I graduated last year with my B.A. in History with a 3.9 out of 4.0 GPA from California State University.  
  
I am in the process of applying to multiple universities for my MA. I have no doubt that I will get accepted into most, if not all, of them. The issue is that I live in Europe now (permanently with my Italian spouse) and am looking at school here since we have no plans on returning to the states. While tuition is cheaper here than in the US, I still cannot afford grad school. I have enough in savings to last me two years of living expenses OR two years of schooling, but not both at the same time. 

I've reached out to nearly a dozen schools and they have all told me that I will not be eligible for their scholarships for Americans because my residency is in Europe, despite being an American citizen. I also don't qualify for scholarships offered to Americans because you must be a resident of America. I also don't qualify for scholarships at American schools in Europe because they are primarily given to those who have residency in America who want to go study abroad, not for those already living here. So, I fall into this strange gray area. I'm an American citizen with residency in Italy, and therefore exempt from both European and American scholarships because I already live here. It's weird, I know. I don't understand the logic either, but that's what I've been told by multiple institutions. To make matters even worse, European scholarships discriminate by age. Since I'm an adult in my mid-30s, I fall outside of most requirements even if there were scholarships I could access.

So, I feel stuck. I can go to school here at an Italian university, but I'd have to pay for it out of pocket, AND I'd be flat broke half-way through. I can't go to an American school in Italy because tuition per year is more than my entire savings. (And getting a loan is out of the question. I refuse to pay back a federal US loan on what will eventually be an Italian salary. It would take ages to pay that off, if ever.)

I'm also a US military veteran, and nearly every scholarship I can find for people like myself are limited to those who currently live and will be attending school in the US.

I feel like my options are nonexistent.

226,McCree_,1611125522,/r/college/comments/l13u3s/i_feel_i_dont_belong_where_i_am/," I am a master student at top 5 university, and I am studying applied math and statistics.

I have a rather long story about climbing up the the academic ladder. But now I am super unconfident in myself and never feel so doubt about myself.

When I was 16, I was kicked out of high school because I did something foolish. I was out of my friend's circle and had no one to talk to. And eventually everyone at my previous school hated on me because I was portraited as a ""bad one"" no student should hang out with, by the school community as well as some parents. So I had no place to go for one and half year. Even my parents gave up on me since we have 4 children in family, and my siblings were doing well. The days were so dark, and I became an underdog. On the edge of giving up on myself, I decided to go to a community college, because my last piece of conscience told me that it was never too late to start over again, despite what other people think about me and I was still young. Luckily it worked out, the community college accepted me and gave me the ""last chance"". I cherish the chance this time. I worked very hard and spend 3 times more work than my peers and I pulled ahead. I got straight A's in my math class (the only thing I am ""good"" at), and then I decided to major in math. Things got better and better eventually and professors started believing in my ability and wrote me letters of recommendations for me to transfer to a better college.

After 2 years of studying community college, I ""jumped"" into a top 40 university in pursing a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics. This university was where I truly elevated my ability in doing math by spending 10+ hours every single day, including weekends and holidays. I believed that my hard work would pay off. I met lots of encouraging classmates as well as nice professors. I eventually forget that I was once an underdog, who everyone expected to lose at whatever I want to do. My life was getting better. After 2 years of studying in the university, I got my bachelors degree with an honor of GPA 3.947. I built my confidence by not getting a single grade below A- at the most high level math courses in my department. Also, I was so happy that I was able to get a graduate school offer from one of the nation's top 5 universities. I also had offers from other universities, which might not be that challenging, but I decided to shoot for the stars and took the challenge. I believed that since I made it here, I can make it again. I accepted the offer from the ""top 5"" university, but that was where all started to fall down...

I was expecting graduate level math to be hard but... It was not hard, it was INSANELY hard. All the brilliant minds in my department are those I just can't compete. They could finish some hard work (at least for me) fast, whereas I need 5 times more time to do. They could read notes easily and go into homework whereas I have to watch lecture videos again and again while searching all those materials online as I never seen them before. It turned out that most of them had already studied at their undergrad, or in some sense they built much better foundation then I did. They are smart, very smart. For my first quarter, I need to spent much time just to prepare for some ""pre-lecture"" material that professors don't even talk about in class, besides the fact that I have to spend even more hours on course materials. As for problem sets consists 6 questions, I needed help for 5 of them. When I ask a question in group, all other members knew the answer. It made me feel like I was so useless. I barely pulled off the first quarter with okay grades but here it comes the second quarter. Everything gets harder and harder where I don't even recognize the definitions in courses. Courses were so hard that I can't even manage time properly to get some sleep. The pace of courses were moving so fast that I cannot keep up with. Also plus the fact that 99% of my classmates got internships for the summer where I don't even have time because I need to study prerequisite for the following year. It seems they got all their futures planned out where I am the only one in the department that finds myself miserable. I think I am the worst person in everything in my department.

I am on the edge of giving up again. I have been thinking about dropping out many times throughout the week. I feel like I do not belong to a place like this, which was meant for mathematicians to be but not like an underdog like me. I think my department accepted me by accident. It might be true that I did some hard work and accomplished something for last few years. But in the end of the day, I am still the guy that was kicked out, who no college wanted to accept. Maybe all those things in the past few years were enough to be proud of and it is now time to give up because I have reached my limit. Maybe I should drop out, from a graduate school that I do not belong at the first place.",college,I Feel I Don't Belong Where I am,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/l13u3s/i_feel_i_dont_belong_where_i_am/,1611143522.0

233,Mr_Two_Bits,1608011740,/r/college/comments/kdg0uc/how_i_failedwithdraw_5_semesters_in_a_row_and/,"I don't hear a lot of stories about failing nearly two years' worth of college and somehow making it back. So here's my story.

I suffer from severe depression. I barely graduated from high school but the extra credits of my AP classes pushed me over. I only applied to one college and I somehow got in 2015. I thought I was doing alright for around two years into college. I got some internships as a sophomore, got into clubs, and did the whole computer science grind life.

But my issues were never actually solved. With depression, people frequently get episodes. They do fine for a bit and then they regress heavily back to a bad place. For the next 2 years, I was in a cycle of almost killing myself, then taking a break, going back to classes, and then falling apart again. I would go to a therapist, take different medications, and nothing would change. At some point, I didn't believe I could change. Ironically, thinking so make it impossible to change.

The scariest part of depression is losing all passion for everything I used to love. For the entire time, I never changed my major from CS because I knew that's what I wanted to do. But when I fell into depression, I just lost all interest in doing anything. I didn't read about CS anymore and just coasted in my apartment watching the world and my friends move on.

I watched people who entered college after I get internships at Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. I saw my friends building careers at these companies. I remember going to the library seeing my friend study and just hanging out. Now I don't recognize anyone in the clubs or the library. I broke down in tears at the library realizing all the time I wasted and all the friends I can't see anymore. With covid, it upended everything and now no one can go to the library.

But the course for me changed. At the beginning of last year, I started to take meditation more seriously. I figured that if nothing could help me, maybe doing this would help. At the start, it didn't do anything. But as I got better at meditation, I realized that its true power lies in examining and reflecting on the thoughts that happen in my head. I had CBT done with me but wasn't helpful since I wasn't taking in the lessons. However, meditation was like taking a microscope to these thoughts and critically examining their sources and their effects. The dark cloud that robbed me of my happiness wasn't random or impenetrable. That mood was fueled by ""clinging."" (This is a Buddhist term). If I just let go of these thoughts, often they don't come back.

This process didn't lift me out of depression entirely. Meditation and reflection were more like cleaning a dirty lens so I can see more clearly. The lens of my mind gets dirty very often and frequently, so I just clean it repeatedly. Often I forget to do so and start to slide into a depression again but I catch myself and reel back from those thoughts. Meditation allowed me to handle the pressure of classes and submit assignments as opposed to withdrawing. I still struggle greatly with time management, anxiety, and feeling tired all the time but I am crawling as opposed to collapsing. 

I lost all of my financial aid since my grades tanked. I know that the only reason why I didn't drop out of college is that my parents were willing to pay for the tuition and fees. I couldn't have gotten here if I just dropped out of college.

If you are a CS major, I wrote how about how I got a summer internship in the bottom of the same post. I cut it out here since not everyone is a CS major. https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kdfzdh/how_i_failedwithdraw_5_semesters_in_a_row_and/?

As of now, I am pretty much on track for a grad transfer for B.A. in Arch. at UCB: I have a solid network, a good transfer plan/plan of action, some insight into the industry, via interviews from people who work in it (intern, junior, senior,) and completion of most of my base arch. classes (1 year to go.) However, the more I keep thinking of architecture, the more I am anxious and pessimistic about it, especially grad school. 

The prime and most important reason is that I no longer have the same excitement about it anymore now that I've gone through the more technical architecture classes, residential design for example. Other reasons include:

1) Worrying about my ability to climb the corporate ladder after uni. education or rather the time it takes to do so per effort.

2) Not at all ok with the dismal financial prospects of the profession.

3) A commonly reported lack of the creative aspect on the job in day-to-day life compared to other elements like legal and business inquiries. I want my job to be a good deal of collaboration, design, and business work, a nice mesh/combo of elements, none of which dominate the other two unless I wish it to. (Last bit accounts for any future endeavors I might pursue in the future: not everything can be planned.)

4) Having to switch careers at 25-26 when in actuality I want this question to be figured out by my current age so by 25-30 I settle myself into a niche within the industry. I am very grateful for my current circumstances, a family that supports my prolonged time in college and does not ask me to pay for rent. I want to take advantage of this time and opportunities, not ask for them (opportunities) again by 25-26.

5) The common reported lack of life balance within the profession, specifically after years of experinece. I definitely do not expect to have any life balance in my 20s, because my 20s is just ""work."" But, I do want to be able to make my job a big part of my life, but not ALL of my life: I do want to account for possible children at age 30-35, and specifically being able to afford myself and them by that time. 

6) The common high debts reported on this major. I want to minimize costs and maximize my time so I can create other financial or business assets that I can leverage for any design endeavors I might want to pursue.

7) The specificity of this field. Sure, architecture is pretty general for other construction spheres and does touch upon other areas like industrial design, but I'm not sure its as general as I would like it to be. 

Now, I know ux/ui and generally, product design, is a hot field right now, getting saturated with a lot of people who are just starting out, a good deal of them career-switchers. And I admit, having the life that a lot of people in these professions report sounds pretty good to me. However, I am not blind: every profession is difficult, it is its own thing, and deserves one to put effort into it. Those who are the best and employ themselves are the most satisfied and financially secure individuals because they do not give up their own power to someone else. And it is important to actually like the profession for it to hold up long-term because the pursuit of interest is what ultimately drives personal satisfaction and exterior success. 

I want to actually be good at what I do, not just jump in on a hot profession for the lifestyle or money it provides. And so pursuing at least an industry of interest and an industry that fits my other life goals while in college is important to me. I know a B.A. doesn't gurantee a job, much less a related one or a good one, but I think switching my focus officially to product design and working on it by myself on the side is the best combination for my current age and situation. My family basically wants me to get a B.A. in anything, as long as it is something and affordable. Time for them does not matter, surprisingly. I think the area of interest for me now is ui design, the superficial side of product development. I like working with graphics, motion, 3D, learning new technologies, and I am definitely very excited about thinking how a user would be interacting with what I make and why: that is the core reason I pursue architecture now, just a different medium. I think ux and product design is also of major interest to me, but ui is really the field I want to zone in on.I am definitely not up for going full on computer science as a major: I want to approach ui and related fields more from design and maybe a minor in business to navigate the market.

So, here are some of my plans of action:

1) Continue architecture and graduate with a BA in it, then do a boot camp to see if product design/ux/ui is for me.

2) Abandon architecture all together and pursue product  design/ux/ui, depending on what feels like the best fit.

3) Continue architecture and take a class on product design/ux/ui, depending on what feels like the best fit, and do free courses on web design-related content over winter break, so I know what I am getting into. Not full-time, but enough to get some understanding of it. (This is the current plan for spring 2020 since I can't take many classes on product design: they are either filled up or I was stupid enough to not be applicable for them since I am not a student for those colleges. Plans 1 and 2 would apply to next summer and fall 2020.)

235,Nekowuzhere,1607631587,/r/college/comments/kan8kl/what_do_you_do_if_you_just_blew_17k_at_a_tech/,"I have been at a technical college for about 5 years. I failed my first two semesters and a few other classes I had failed multiple times, but I was so determined to at least get better grades so maybe a 4-year school will accept me. If I couldn't get into a 4-year I was planning on finishing my Associate in Science.   
Anyway I have two more math classes ( I am awful at math) to go before I get my associate degree, but I got accepted into a 4-year college that my sister went to. I have been taking classes that transfer over to this 4-year school so I was really excited. Turns out for the Biology program I want to do only 4 classes transfer over. I have 54 credits at the tech college so only 16 transfer towards my degree.   
I have reached my credit limit at my tech school which means I can't get FASFA anymore. Tech college classes are roughly $200 while 4-year college is about $500 per credit. I found out from my Biology program, I can take 8 classes at the technical college that I would need for my Biology degree. It would be smart to do because its cheap, but I have to pay out of pocket, which I can't afford or get a lot of private loans. I am really frustrated I blew $15k on classes that didn't help me and that I wasted 5 years in school to only get a semester done at the 4-year college. 

Now I am at a point where I don't know if I should do private loans or what I can do to help pay for the classes at the tech school. I also don't know If I should finish my Associate degree even if it wont help me towards my biology program.   
I just need to make a lot of money to pay back school and I am really fed up with myself as I wasted so much time and money into classes I didn't need. My academic advisors were no help either and one even laughed at me when I said I wanted to go to a 4-year college.    
I could apply for scholarships, but most want high school seniors and a 3.0 gpa or higher Plus I am not very smart so I feel I will waste my time on essays not to win them and be more disappointed in myself. I have a 2.9 GPA so I am just under.   
I'm also really wanting to just be done with school and get on with my life. Its really upsetting that I wasted all my time.  I struggle with ADHD and mild neurocognitive disorder which make school harder for me.

237,ThinVast,1607468035,/r/college/comments/k9f4ke/american_universities_should_move_away_from_a/,"Highschool is the partly the reason why I think we have so many U.S colleges that enforce a liberal arts education curriculum and make you take all these gen eds that are not part of your major. Defenders of liberal arts colleges like to say that you need to go to college "" so you can become more well rounded, better critical thinker"" as if highschool could not teach you that. I mean what is the purpose of highschool if I have to go to college to be able ""to become a better thinker"" and whatnot. I mean, I've heard various versions from Americans about the point of going to college but not the point of highschool or the K-12 system and how it plays a role in students transitioning into college or into adult life.

Other universities around the world don't enforce a liberal arts education that emphasizes well rounded learning. If you major in history, you just study history. If you major in math, you just study math. You can graduate in as soon as 3 years because you don't have to take these other courses that dont' pertain to your major. Those majors I listed don't aim to prepare you for jobs like engineering so it's not a vocation. Only in America, will people say that college is supposed to make you take these well rounded courses and that if you just want to study the topic of your major, then it's considered a vocation or trade school mean for job training even if you just want to study music theory all day. Some Americans need to realize that when they define college, it is not a fundamental concept of higher education, but an American concept. Even the word ""college"" in the U.K means a different thing from college in America. Defenders of gen eds in college also like to say that engineers need a liberal arts education so they can become better writers and understand about ethics better, but it doesn't require 6 humanities/social science courses or an extra year of studying all these different courses simply to be a better communicator, orator, or have a better understand of ethics. I'm not denying the importance of these skills, but if you look at canadian colleges like the University of Toronto, a math specialist degree only require students to take a a few ethics courses. I don't think graduates of universities outside the U.S are somehow less educated because they didn't have a well rounded education in higher education. As I mentioned before, what is the purpose of highschool if college has to educate me again to become a better communicator. Additionally, my college education costs 52k USD in tuition per year so why should I not be able to choose the courses I want? It's not like my education is being subsidized by the government. Of course, the motivating reason for me to be at my university is for the connections after I graduate and a specific academic program within the university I like because realistically, no one is going to pay 52k USD per year if they want to ""have a well rounded education."" If you think a liberal arts college education is so important, you would still pay 52k USD and be in debt for a long time, right?

Defenders of the liberal arts in colleges would say that if education was free and subsidized, it shouldn't matter if you had to to take courses that you were not interested in. However, as I mentioned before, why not have all the well rounded learning in highschool. Did I  learn jackshit before going to college. I am taking many gen eds in college that I have taken before in highschool so I am basically re learning the same subjects. You might say that I should take AP classes and then I wouldn't have gen eds and this whole discussion would be pointless. But , realize that AP classes exist because the rigor across all American highschools are not uniform. Anecdotally, I have even heard a highschool student outside of the the U.S say that an AP class in the U.S is equivalent to a non honors class in their highschool so that says a lot about the rigor of the U.S education system. If education was not controlled on a State or local level and was controlled by the federal government, perhaps we wouldn't need these gen eds to re teach highschool students. I am sure most of you wont deny that there is an issue with the U.S K-12 system considering how much more is funded for public schools despite English and Math proficiency levels of U.S students not being as high as other countries. When people discuss about the problem with universities in American I dont' think the K-12 system cannot be ignored like it is its own separate issue.

When I hear people say the liberal arts encompasses math and science, I also find that very disingenuous. The liberal arts curriculum in the college that supposedly encompasses math and science is probably one math and two science course a student takes and I don't think students gain much value from one math class in college. The liberal arts curriculum is most likely made up of social science/humanities courses, so the liberal arts barely encompasses subjects outside the humanities and social sciences. Someone majoring in humanities in a liberal arts college is more likely to take liberal arts classes that overlap with their degree requirement than a STEM major in a liberal arts college who has to take many liberal arts classes that are not related to their degree. Also realize that the liberal arts has meant slightly different things in the past. The liberal arts during the Renaissance period was rooted in classical languages and literature and had a strong emphasis on the humanities.

I would like to say a lot more but I have condensed it into fewer words. My entire point of writing this is that I vehemently dislike these gen eds I have to take and that I dread every single moment of taking. I went to college so that I can study math and only math. These gen eds divide my attention and make me distracted from my goal of studyng math. I have learned a lot more and far more during the summer studying math on the my own because I had no distractions, but because I have these gen eds to take, I feel bottlenecked like my potential is wasted. If I put my heart to math, I would probably fail my other classes because I'd get so obsessed. I could study math all day, and you might think it makes me a very narrow minded boring person ""who doesn't deserve to be in college"" like many others have told me and I think I have heard every type of response, but I don't care what you think. I have had countless discussions with many people on why a liberal arts education in higher education is important but nothing has changed my mind that I dislike my liberal arts education and do not find as much value in it and I don't think anything will ever change my mind no matter what anyone says. If anyone tries to change my mind, it will only increase my hatred of the rhetoric by americans about the importance of the liberal arts. I have even considered dropping out of college just to prove a point about how serious I am. Hearing Americans discuss about the importance of a liberal arts college makes me angry since it feels like it's being shoved down my throat. I guess it all comes down to, why can't I choose what I'd like to study?",college,American universities should move away from a forced liberal arts education.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/k9f4ke/american_universities_should_move_away_from_a/,1607486035.0

I'll be getting those two credits out of the way this Spring.

Now of course, we can debate all we want on whether this is helping student become more well rounded and socially conscious or is just the university's way of trying to squeeze more money out of students by requiring classes that are unnecessary to their field (probably a little bit of both, imo) but here's the thing.

I've always like the idea of getting a degree in humanities and spending my four years at college learning and discussing topics like this. The only reason I didn't was because no one (especially my family) thought that would be practical, especially since I have to take out loans to afford to even come here (also, my main scholarship is from the engineering school, so can't just leave it)

Which is why I'm a Computer Science major because it's a degree that will increase my chances of being able to immediately get a job with a decent pay grade and the tech makes the world go round, so no chances I'd lose job security anytime soon.

That being said, I'm bored with the field. I have no interest in it whatsoever outside the practical financial ones. Every few weeks, we sit through a presentation about how cool being an engineer/programmer/software developer is and how we're changing the world while getting paid a whole bunch, but outside of the money I'm not feeling it. I honestly think once my schedule is less gen-eds and more CompSci heavy I'll go insane.

So I've been thinking and researching and my current schedule for next semester will give me 6 credit hours that fit with the Women's and Gender Studies minor (which is only 15 credit hours in total).

And it seems like a fun field to be in, discussing topics that I really care about and would like to learn more about.

I probably won't talk to my advisor about it until Summer when it's time to pick out my schedule for Fall. I can't talk to my parents about it because they'll just tell me I'm being impractical and I shouldn't waste my time with such a useless thing (which is their response when I bring up anything I'm interested in). I have one friend from my LGBTQ+ group who is already in humanities so I'll probably talk to them about it next meeting.

But, I just need some feedback here. Am I just following a pipe dream? Should I be dedicating all my time and energy towards my major, the very idea of which sucks the life out of me?

Today, my college has announced that they are giving us a week to decide whether we would like to go on-campus for the first time or continue to study remotely.  Although more details are suppose to release tomorrow, they have told us so far that all courses will still remain online.

If I'm being truly honest, I have wanted to go on-campus for so, so long.  However, at the same time, I am definitely concerned about being the person that will cause a massive outbreak.  I definitely don't want others to get coronavirus, and I have a huge fear that if I go and I get corona, I'll give it to all my classmates.

My two choices are:

1. Stay Home

* \+I get to spend more time with my family, which is absolutely awesome.
* \+My family and I will save money by not paying room and board.
* \+I love bike riding, and I can do that at home.
* \-Although I absolutely love my family, and I know I'll miss them, I've been yearning for a college experience for a really long time and am super excited, particularly because I haven't seen anyone outside my family since March for the most part.
* \-I haven't had many opportunities to connect with my classmates online.
* \-I've never had an opportunity to go to my college's campus, so I'm super excited for the chance to go.  If I decide not to go, I may not be able to be on-campus again till August 2021.

2. Go On-Campus

* \+It will be a lot of fun to have the chance to connect with my classmates, especially because so far, the majority of my classmates seem to be going on-campus.
* \+It's super exciting that this will be my first time on campus and getting to explore the community.
* \+I have an odd feeling that I might be more motivated around other students taking courses with me, although I'm not sure if my assumption would be wrong.
* \+Since classes are all online, I don't think there's too much of a chance that a high exposure will break out at my college.
* \+Students who I know who currently live on campus told me that the school has been safe and doing things really well.
* \-Will be more expensive as I'll pay room and board.
* \-I can't bring my bike with me, so I'll either have to buy a new bike at my college or decide not to bike at all.
* \-Since classes are online completely, my experience in terms of classes would be the same at home and on campus.
* \-I am definitely concerned about being the person that will cause a massive outbreak.  I definitely don't want others to get coronavirus, and I have a huge fear that if I go, I'll give COVID to all my classmates.

This post isn't geared at someone who's got the full ride to their dream college, so if thats you, this post likely isn't very relevant. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I know now a day there is a stigma that going straight to university after college is the right thing to do if you want to be successful and get a good job, and I want to say that its simply not true at all.** 

&amp;#x200B;

4 years ago I was in a position like many of you are right now finishing high school and not having a lot of guidance or idea of what I really wanted or what I really needed other than the fact my mother told me ""You can go to college and live at home, or you can not go to college and get kicked out, it's up to you."" 

&amp;#x200B;

That said I was no more than a 2.7GPA in high school and a 2.99GPA finishing off college so I am by no means a top of my class student in any realm, in fact I think that puts me basically at the bottom, basically a C average student at best, even though I felt I really tried (attending multiple hours of after school tutoring sessions, etc.. nothing really clicked), I scored an 18 on my ACT (well below the a good score) and was told to basically stay away from anything STEM related. So I can say with confidence that there are people in a lot better situations (and those in less than or equal to as well) in terms of finances, scholarships, and college advice, and I want to hopefully even help just ONE person with this post. 

&amp;#x200B;

This post isn't geared at someone who's got the full ride to their dream college, its geared towards someone who doesn't know what they want to do with their life, or even someone who just cannot outright afford university whether it be because their family isn't contributing or they don't get any financial aid, or they don't have any scholarships in general. **These are all very real scenarios that the majority of people run into all the time, and it can be crippling to your future if not handled correctly.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to provide some resources and advise for anyone who is considering taking college loans out SHOULD at least consider and review. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- People who still have have 1+ years of high school**

**PLEASE** consider dual enrollment classes, a lot of high schools are offering them now a day, I was able to graduate high school with 47 college credits by simply doing college courses over high school courses (and believe it or not I found them much easier to do, I attended a free ""college prep"" ""private"" high school) and found my classes extremely challenging, so instead I started taking most of my classes at community college through my high school for literally 10$/credit. I realize not all high schools have this option, but if you do, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE take advantage of it. This is an easy and cheap way to get general electives out of the way for college, and finishing high school at the same time, and it quite literally made high school easier for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- People who don't know what they want to major in**

This happens ALL THE TIME, people have no idea what they want to do, so they just attend a university as undeclared or as some random major that they end up switching 5 times in two years, if this is you, GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE, because all you're going to be doing is general electives and classes at your full university for 5x the price. You can do all of this, at community college, probably live at home, work a part time job, and really think about what you want to do before making any major decisions. It truly makes sense. 

(**THE ABOVE ADVICE WORKS THE SAME WAY FOR PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO MAJOR IN, YOU'RE JUST GOING TO BE DOING GENERAL ELECTIVES FOR THE MOST PART OF YOUR FIRST TWO YEARS OF UNIVERSITY, JUST DO THEM AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE)**

&amp;#x200B;

**- DON'T FEEL PRESSURED INTO GOING TO UNIVERSITY**

I have seen this so many times people feel absolutely left out that all their friends are leaving for some university, and they don't want to be the odd man out who doesn't end up going.  DON'T let your emotions get the best of you, this isn't about your friends, or your high school reputation (that no one cares about) this is about you and your financial future, don't get confused why you're going to college. 

Don't get yourself in debt for the sake of feelings, don't worry about anyone else but yourself. Odds are you're not going to know anyone that you went to high school with 3 months after you start college. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- Don't go to community college or university: TRADE SCHOOL**

For some people they feel as though they have no other option, this is simply untrue, trade schools exist for a reason, they're cheap and teach you a skill that can be used in the real world. I was on the fence on going to college simply because I absolutely did NOT like school, and my grades really showed that, but I did have a passion for the subject that I wanted to learn so I decided i'd like it better than the other options for trade school. But trade schools are by no means a bad thing at all. They exist for a reason. If you're going to go to college and get a learn a bunch of stuff that you don't like, you might as well just go learn a trade that you don't like for a fraction of the price and end up without crippling debt and a job! 

&amp;#x200B;

**- RESEARCH YOUR JOB PROSPECTS**

While college and higher education is there to continue your studies on a defined topic of your choice, if you're going into it with no money you MUST look at your job prospects, though I hate to say that you shouldn't go to college with the sole purpose of getting a fancy job, you should at least consider the opportunities you have after college in your field once you finish college. 

Unfortunately we're at a place where we have to treat college as an investment rather than a place to go learn regardless of the outcome, if you have all the money in the world and want to go study some weird obscure topic that has zero job possibility, thats totally fine. But this post is geared towards those who must treat college as an investment and NOT a luxury. 

High education will always be there, you can always go back, but you can't ever undo your college debt once you've signed for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- DO. THE. MATH.  LOOK AT ALL YOUR OPTIONS FOR YOUR UNIVERSITIES AND YOUR OPTIONS**

CONSIDER all your options in every university you can, look at all the data. Everyone wants to go to the school with the best program so they can get the best education, but the reality of the situation is,  its not at all feasible.  Unless you're getting financial aid and scholarships, its best just to choose the cheapest option, seriously. What you put into your education is what you'll get out of it.

We're at a time where we have everything available to us with a single google search. If you want to get the education of an MIT computer science student, you can do that, most of their lectures are posted on YouTube for FREE. THATS A FREE MIT EDUCATION, apply that with your normal classes at your University and you'll be a rockstar. Most companies want COMPETENT employees not fancy degrees. If you can prove your competencies and expertise on a subject in a job interview while someone with a harvard law degree cannot, they'll choose you any day of the week.  

&amp;#x200B;

**- REMEMBER WHY YOU'RE GOING TO COLLEGE**

SO MANY COLLEGES offer all these fancy dorms, gyms, campus coffee bars, etc. It looks awesome, living the american dream! But YOU WILL PAY FOR IT. That stuff doesn't come cheap and schools pass that cost right down to you. Don't fall victim to it, go to school for your education, not the fancy features that they give you. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 As someone who finished school with $20,000 in student loans, there are people who come out with 10x that who will never pay it off, people who will live pay check to pay check for the rest of their lives, don't do that to yourself. 

Be smart, be objective, do your own research. Don't feel pressured, don't be persuaded, do whats best for YOU. 

I know its hard when you're young and you don't think it'll be that big of a deal, and you'll be able to handle it. Even if that is the case, don't put yourself through that stress, its seriously unhealthy. 

No ones going to spoon feed you this information if they haven't already. You have to be ready to make your own decisions that'll affect you for the rest of your life. Do the research that it requires.

I'm a 22 year old college student in Northern CA, and I am really interested in moving out of my parents house--there's 4 adults all living together and it's so loud, I can't focus on my schoolwork. My parents are amazing and pay for my college in full and don't charge me rent, but sharing a room with my sister, who is the same age as me, is really difficult. I am 22 and have absolutely 0 privacy and with COVID, 0 quiet time to study. 

Right now I'm working at a job I really enjoy, but can currently only work 19hrs/week rn and am not allowed to work more than 24hrs/week. I make about $800/month, and the average rent for a 1 bedroom apartment in my area is about $1300/month, which is also what student living charges. I am a full time student but do not get much from FAFSA as my parents pay for my school. Because my income has been disposable for so long and bc I have no debt, I have nearly $20,000 in my savings account.

I'm on track to graduate next Fall, in 2021, but I need to continue to go full time to make that happen. I know other students that I work with who have moved out with their friends/SO's and they were able to make it happen, but I can't figure out how. I know it's not smart to spend more than 1/3 of your income on rent but that would be pretty impossible for me. Is there anyone out there who knows the secret to moving out in this kind of situation? I don't expect my parents to pay for it or help me with my living expenses.

I know people will tell me to just put up with it for another year but I don't know how much longer I can stand it and I fear my grades will slip bc I can't go on campus to study and never have a quiet space to work (campus is completely closed, and police will escort you off the premises if you are there.)

I don't like that I'm forced to pay thousands of dollars to get a piece of paper in order to get a job. It makes no sense to me. But that's the world we live in and the field I want to go into, so I've accepted it.

I moved back in with my parents because of Covid, and I was lamenting to my mom about how I don't have much motivation because I simply don't want to do this. She's a very positive person and usually has good advice for me. The conversation helped, and at the end of it, I said ""I'm just going to keep chugging through this thing that I hate and do it to the best of my ability."" Then she said that she thinks I'll do better if I stop hating school. While this might be true, I can't 'just stop hating school' because I actually physically don't like it at all. I can't pretend that everything is fine when in reality it's not.

243,lilahmabailey,1606098783,/r/college/comments/jz92w2/would_i_be_better_off_deleting_my_social_medias/,"I'm technically a junior in high school, but since all the schools in my area are not adapting well to online school, I am now ""homeschooled,"" and basically just starting college (at the community college) and getting a GED instead of finishing high school. That's why my parents and I agreed that I'd start out slow, only take two classes this semester, and then slowly work my way up to more classes.(i'm doing all online rn) Next semester, I'm taking four classes--history from 1877, comp 2, some math class, and floral design.

Right now, I'm doing fine in history till 1877 and comp 1, but I feel like I'm ALWAYS doing schoolwork because I keep getting distracted with other things. This is definitely going to and is currently biting me in the backside. I procrastinate so badly (like right now) and I have ADD, so I can ""spend hours"" on schoolwork but do nothing at all.  I always get distracted with social media and games. After staring at the screen for a half hour, I feel like I need a break, then maybe I can focus. When in reality, I know that I can easily do something more pleasurable.

Turning off my phone doesn't help because I can access everything on my computer if I want to. I don't think it would be too extreme until I consider that I'd be cutting off contact with some online friends if I deleted instagram, and as a fairly lonely person, I'd be cutting myself off from the world if I deleted reddit. Which, frankly, I've been without both before and been fine. 

The games issue, I can't bring myself to uninstall them right now (especially the ONE I was willing to pay for) but when I get a new phone, I just won't download any games. That will solve my problem there-- anyway, I have better, healthier, non-addictive things to waste my time on.

But still, the problem with social media stands. I have no REAL problem with deleting reddit (although I might keep it for only things like this), but instagram, I'm struggling with. I have a few online friends that I can't communicate with outside of instagram. I could wait until I'm 18 and get their phone numbers, but that's a little over a year away and that's a pretty long time for a fairly young friendship.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: I'm using games and social media to procrastinate on schoolwork, which will increase next semester. Do y'all think it would be too extreme to delete my social medias and games? Can you think of any other options?

     Has anyone had an experience with the college grade appeal process? This semester I chose the pass/fail grading option for my math class. My Final grade was an F (fail) 

  This course is a graduation requirement and I really needed to pass this class. I recently got off of academic probation and have worked very hard this semester and turned everything in on time. During one class  session it was myself, her and 1 other student. The other kids couldn't even bother to log on. I never cheated on exams or assignments but know many others who did. My exams brought me down. If I take this F  I will be graduating a semester behind my class. When I emailed my Professors she only responded with the course breakdown, my final grade and told me to look at her syllabus. I'm just schocked bc she was aware that I am in tutoring and have accomdiations. I can't drop the class or withdraw because that deadline has passed. An incomplete wouldn't do any good bc I don't have any outstanding work.

 I specifically chose the pass/fail option (over the regular letter grade system)  for a reason in case I didn't do as well as I intended.  I already emailed my Department head but am afraid  he will take her side and say I have no case. My school has a very toxic reputation of trying to keep students so they will ""continue to pay"" year after year

On the last day of class my professor was chatting me up via Zoom asking me about my interests, hobbies, travel ect. I thought we really connected.  She was also saying that I was an ""absolute treasure to have in her class""

246,Caffine_Whore,1605424911,/r/college/comments/jui2mr/help_should_i_major_in_computer_engineering_or/,"Okay, so this is a long one but I am applying to colleges right now and I still don't know what major I should choose between Comp. Engineering and Business.

My parents want me to go into a computer science/engineering related field. I have no experience in coding or any programing languages other than one class where I learned nothing. Most other people who go into this field already have basic coding experience which puts me at a disadvantage. I also don't know how good I will be at it/how much I will enjoy the job I get after college. However, with a comp. engineering degree, it pays very well, and it is very easy to get a job right out of college, especially in the tech area that I'm living in. Currently my family is not very well off, and I know if I get a comp. engineering degree, it is almost guaranteed that I will be able to live a comfortable life and help my family.

However, I recently thought about getting a majoring in business with a business administration/project management degree. Business is something that I feel as if I am good at and can do, as I have taken business classes in high school, and am currently securing a business/project management internship. However, I know that getting a job will be a lot harder with only a business degree, it it is not a guarantee that the job I get will pay well (and I don't have a security blanket with my family to fall back on). Also, when companies hire project managers, they tend to hire people that already work in the field of that business as they would have more insight into the specifics of that industry. Also, I looked it up and almost 50% of people with a business/marketing degree are unemployed.

Something that my mom said to me was that I could start off in computer engineering and then work up to a project management position where I would not have to do much coding/programming.

Also, since I am applying to colleges, I have low grades with no SAT/ACT scores due to Covid, and since comp. engineering is a very highly sought after major, I will most likely not get accepted into good colleges if I apply into a comp. engineering program. It is also almost impossible to switch into a engineering program due to high demand and limited space if I change my mind.

**TL;DR**    I can't choose between applying for comp. engineering and business.

247,SNRNXS,1605324982,/r/college/comments/jtv1y7/i_feel_like_i_wanna_drop_out/,"This feels like something I'd post on r/self or some similar sub but since it involves college I thought it'd be better here.

I know that dropping out is a legitimate option, and lots of people do it. But I feel like if I drop out I'm just giving up. It's not like I've found a perfect job or career for me where I don't need a degree and drop out for that reason. I'm just a 2nd year college student. I only work at a grocery store deli weekends only because otherwise I'm a full time student. But I really don't think college is for me.

I was forced by my family to go into college under the idea that if you don't go to college you'll be stuck working at McDonald's the rest of your life. I know that idea is a bunch of bullshit because there's plenty of people who have led successful careers without going to college. I wanted to take a gap year after high school because I didn't feel I was ready for college just yet. But my mom said no, and forced me to go anyways.

That first semester I majored in architecture. I thought it was what I wanted to do; I had an interest in buildings, and after previously looking over all of the majors my university offers, that was the only one that stood out to me. Come the end of the semester, I had stopped going to my architecture studio class. I felt left out my members of my studio group. Everyone was making things much better than I was. I had no real will to continue in that class anymore.

I ended up dropping that major and going exploratory the next semester. That's when I discovered a new major coming from a satellite campus that had just expanded to the main one, where I was. It was an animation &amp; game design major, which focuses on 3D modeling, animation, digital design, etc. I figured since I like video games and computers it might work out well for me. That's what I've been doing this semester, and I'm starting to feel the same way as I did my architecture class. I don't feel like I'm into it. Everyone else in the class is making things much better than I am. I still have a good grade-- I think the professor must grade based on whether you do the work, not how good you do it. But at this point I'm just half-assing my assignments. I don't feel like I'm actually learning anything.

Some people go to college because they want the ""college experience."" Yeah, well I haven't had that. My first semester I was in a dorm room by myself (by choice; thank god I didn't have to share with someone). I thought I was going to reinvent myself after high school. Back then, I was quiet, not sociable outside my small circle of friends, and never talked unless spoken to or when I needed to for class. I never did any clubs, never went to sports games, school dances including prom, etc. I was never interested in any of it (I actually couldn't go to prom anyways because you needed a date, but I didn't want to go anyways).

Well, I didn't change in college. I never left my room except for class. I didn't do clubs because I went home on weekends (I lived in a dorm, but home was 50 minutes away, couldn't have my car though). No one ever really came out of their rooms on my dorm floor. I never made any friends and barely saw the two I found out also went to my university from high school. I mainly stuck to talking with old friends online, which is really what I always did.

Then COVID happened.

We all got sent home in March. I was so glad, I hated living on campus. My fall semester I made it so it was all online, otherwise I would've needed to pay for a dorm room to literally be there one day of the week for a class I was previously scheduled for that wasn't online for that one meeting time. I did the same thing when I scheduled for spring. But because everything is online, I feel like I'm learning nothing. Well, for most classes I prefer to do it online because they're bullshit core classes that need not exist and I can just google the answers to. But with my current 3D modeling class, even though I watch the videos my professor posts and follow along, I still feel like I've learned hardly anything at all.

The same goes for a Java programming class I have to take. I was never into coding and am only taking it because it's required for the degree, but even though I follow along with the videos, I feel like I learn nothing. Well, maybe I would if I read the textbooks. But I cannot be made to read 40-50 pages per class each week of nothing but text. Hell, I can hardly read story books, I am so burnt out of reading walls of text.

I'm just feeling like maybe college isn't my thing. But dropping out and not knowing what to do with my life isn't my only problem. I'm not in any debt-- I haven't taken any loans to pay for college. It's all been paid for via FAFSA and my mom. She's pretty well off, owning her own company. I don't know how much she makes, but it's enough to cover what FAFSA doesn't and still buy a $50K Ram here, turn around and trade it in on an $85K Lincoln there, etc.

She's paying for my college, and expects me to go through and finish it. If I dropped out, it would absolutely piss her off. I can't imagine what she would do then. Essentially she would've wasted $20-some thousand by now (luckily because I'm not living on campus, all of my classes were covered by FAFSA this semester). I don't know if she would expect me to pay it back, which I sure as hell can't do. Also, back when I dropped out of my architecture major, I didn't tell my mom about it. I figured she'd be furious. The day I went home for winter break, she asked me how everything was going, I just said ""fine"" like usual. But she knew. The day we went back, she said, ""when are you going to tell me that you dropped out of architecture?"" She was mad about that, and on top of it that I didn't tell her. I can't imagine what she'd do if I fully dropped out of college.

And then there's my dad. I haven't lived with him since he divorced my mom when I was 3. He sometimes visits for a couple days or a week or two per year since he's busy with being full time in the military. But recently when he came to visit in August, I told him about my major. He was so excited and supportive of me taking it, saying how it was the future, one of the biggest upcoming industries, etc. If I drop out, I'm going to extremely disappoint him. Not only that, I'll disappoint everyone in my family to the point where I'm pretty sure I'll become estranged.

I just don't know what to do. I don't feel any motivation to keep going through college. But if I drop out, I don't know what to do. I don't want to disappoint my whole family. I don't know how I can go on. Nothing seems to interest me enough to make a career out of it. And of the things that I do have interest in, either you can't really make a career out of it, it's very high risk, or unrealistic. I like video games, but what sort of job can you make out of it? Streaming? I already know I'd be a bad streamer, and if my mom saw me drop out to do that, she would kill me. The only other stuff I regularly do is watch TV shows, movies, or Youtube videos, and of course I can't make a living doing that. I like cars, and if I could do anything I would like to try and design cars and manufacture them as my own brand, but that's unrealistic for someone like me to do. The only thing I have left is maybe writing. I've been wanting to write a story for a long time now, coming up with tons of ideas and whatnot. But hardly any authors become successful, and it's not something I can just bank on happening.

I was flirting with an idea and was curious if anyone else had any experiences or can give any other angles before I make this a reality.

I've currently decided to re-enroll back to school - and I'll be overloading credits (21) in the spring semester. This means that I will be focusing most of my energy on school, and I cannot afford to work on the side. The classes I will be taking will not be hard. 

Now, I pay rent and the last thing I want to do is drain more money out of my savings (I can come out debt free) if I try to minimize my costs to zero. Living at home is not an option, unfortunately.

Semester starts Jan, and ends May (5 months). In these five months, I will be paying around $6000ish to keep me afloat. 

Now, I was thinking moving to Mexico or a South American country for those five months to save money. I've always taken online classes, so this COVID-19 situation isn't really new to me. I'm pretty disciplined so I don't see why I can't go somewhere outside the US to take these classes. I've traveled extensively outside the US alone before.

If I were to move to lets say Mexico, I can get an Airbnb to myself - and with food, transportation etc. I can pocket $4k of living expenses for the semester. I have tons of mile points so flights aren't an issue for me.

I enrolled in the courses late, with special permission from the department, because I decided kind of last minute that I wanted to take them. The courses are both fully online and modules to submit every 2-3 weeks. 

Right after I started the classes, around mid-September, my work life got CRAZY (I work full time) and I fell behind in classes. I got really overwhelmed with everything and had a bit of a mental health crisis. My go-to coping mechanism is avoidance, so I stopped doing any and all work for the classes. I also didn't submit some of my financial aid papers. 

So now, a month later, I'm trying to play catch up, but with the semester ending in two weeks there is no way for me to finish all the work. Plus, I won't get full credit for the assignments that are late. My financial aid was ""cancelled"" because I forgot to sign a paper, so I have an outstanding bill. I'm still not sure if I can fix the financial aid situation or if I'm just going to have to pay it. It sounds like I may be able to submit the paperwork and still receive the loans, though. 

My professors emailed me and one (who is also my advisor) said I may be able to take an incomplete in each course, or appeal to the university for a late withdrawal. The other professor said that she will no longer accept any assignments and to ""let her know what I want to do."" 

I have no idea what to do or if I can fix this. I've never failed a class before - in undergrad I was a star student. I just bit off way more than I could chew this semester and I let myself drown. I really don't want to end up with an F (or FX?) on my transcript. 

I also could use these classes for a pay raise at work, so I'd like to actually complete them. Things have calmed down at work so I could potentially do the work now, I just can't catch up on the missed assignments. 

My question is...should I try to get incompletes and make up the work, or should I appeal for a late withdrawal? I don't have any ""extenuating circumstances"" other than just being overwhelmed with work. Not a good excuse, I know. Will either one impact my future financial aid more than the other? 

I could potentially start a graduate program at another University in the spring, for which I was accepted over the summer. Should I just try to withdrawal from all the classes at this school and re-start at the other school?

* Had no internship experience. Quote, she said that internships were a waste of her time (partly because it was beneath her (her dad is rich and he pays her tuition) and it didn't pay enough) when I suggested she try to start looking for some back in her sophomore year. 
* Never networked or went to a career fair. Doesn't even see the importance of LinkedIn. 
* Had never written a resume until a class assignment required her to write one. The one I saw was atrocious. No good format, everything was tossed in that she had done from high school. I gave her a template to work with, and she couldn't even manipulate Word to make a half-way decent resume. 
* Limited work experience. The last ""real"" job she had was as a sales associate at a large discount department store for 3 months. Before that, she worked for her parents for 3 months. 
* A lot of volunteer experience. Most of it during high school and early college years. Nothing that really related to her major. 

It was really depressing to try to help someone who didn't know what job she could even do with her major, couldn't write a resume to apply to jobs ASAP, etc. I literally told her there was no way I could help her, and I told her she may have potentially ruined her life because I don't see how you can get a job without even trying to get good grades, network, or have some internship experience.

254,TheRapidTrailblazer,1603763323,/r/college/comments/jis9r6/not_really_sure_what_to_do_with_my_life_rn/,"I am currently going to a community college and my major is Science, A.S. The major is designed to transfer to a bunch of science/math courses at Universities. So far, I was originally going to major in chemistry, but after getting a difficult professor for Gen chem 1 and experiencing zoom community college with Gen chem 2 and organic chemistry 1 (even with a good professor) I became very certain that Chemistry would not be the subject I would major in, and decided to go along with Biology in the future. I looked at the University I was going to transfer to and I was looking forward to taking the upper level Bio courses even though some said they were really hard.

Now I am taking BIO 101 and 50% of the time I like it and 50% of the time its an annoying ass class with a lot of work. I can't tell if i'm disliking it because of its online-features (I don't pay attention to lectures I hate them), or maybe general biology just sucks and I haven't reached the good stuff yet, or its just not the right major for me. I'm not struggling in the class, I have an A. But now I am questioning whether I really wanna major in this subject. I am hoping that I am having a negative response due to covid tearing up the joys of learning. 

If I'm being true to myself, I am not that science-oriented. I love math and would like to major in that. Growing up my parents HIGHLY encouraged me to go to medical school and made it seems like it was the best job in the whole world and I would be making awesome money with prestige while helping sick people. Honestly I feel like medical school is blown out of proportion. Don't get me wrong and M.D is an awesome achievement and being a doctor can be rewarding but I just don't see it as something I was to slave away going to school for. I don't want to study for the MCAT, spend four years splitting my brain in half during medical school and spend 3-7 years of residency like school wasn't enough. And then watch my peers start their lives and have kids and enjoy being an adult out of school 

After making the decision that medical school is not the moves, I felt afraid that I was at an age where I pretty much had to know what I want to do in life so I can work towards that. I spent my entire life dreaming about medical school but I never even seriously considered other careers. I felt envious of my peers who had their whole lives researching and thinking of what they WANT do in life and how their parents gave them support 100%, they didn't feel pressured to choose a specific job or field.

Meanwhile I was deciding what I wanted to do in the future instead of medical school during my senior year of high school. I decided on pharmacist because even though they had to go to grad school, there was not much schooling after that and it was still healthcare so my parents wouldn't be really upset if I went against medical school. Honestly part of the reason why I choose pharmacy was because I was too scared to look at fields that wasn't healthcare. I wasn't able to take myself out of that comfort zone and really search what I want because I was afraid it was something my parents would want me to do. I think I want to do something math education related but my parents said I won't get a job with a math major and teachers don't get paid enough. LIKE FIRST OF ALL IM NOT TRYING TO BE RICH. I'm currently a math tutor at my community college and its really fun and fufilling. I like the feeling after helping a struggling student with a math problem even if it gets stressful at times. I have a sister who wants to have an art career and my parents were extremely against it and were completely unsupportive at first. She pretty much went through a mini crisis because other than art she doesn't really want to do anything else and my parents were really mad, my mom was especially livid and said things she shouldn't have said but she apologized later. Luckily for her they are supportive now and look for ways to help her

Studying drugs even looks really interesting (and it is!). So I got my pharmacy technician certification and I just got a job as a pharmacy tech after a year of job searching (Im a college student, scheduling is hard). I been working as a tech for a few weeks and I don't think being a pharmacist is for me because I been watching the ones at my job and it looks like the tasks they do are boring/difficult/and repetitive. Unless they are talking to a customer they pretty much stand in one place. At least as a technician its more of a stand/walk/crouch job. I was kinda split between being a pharmacologist (they make drugs) and being a pharmacist but I decided that being a pharmacologist is the moves for me for now. Another reason why I started leaning towards pharmacology was because the job market for pharmacists are a dumpster fire. It's not worth it to go into debt for school and have trouble finding a stable and decent paying job afterwards.

Some backstory: I really want to live on residence next year and study kinesiology but I don't want to be under the pressure of financial problems that I might face after graduation due to not having any money to pay off loans (that would accumulate interest). My mom frowns upon taking a gap year just to work though she can't afford to help pay for school so I would have to be reliant on myself at the end of the day.

Has anyone owed money back for withdrawing halfway through a semester? Do you know what the calculation is like?

I responded that I was using the textbook on a different monitor in order to relate what was said in class to what's in the textbook.

Dear (professor name,)

&gt;Today, you accused me of not staying engaged during class and your statement has deeply offended me. You implied that because I was not looking at the camera during the class, that I was not ""engaged"" in the class. Just because I am not looking at the camera, does not mean that I am not listening to what is being said. You also stated that you thought that I was using my computer for outside purposes. If I was playing a game on my computer, that would be a different story but I have the textbook open in order to relate what is said in the class to what is said in the textbook. I pay over 50,000 dollars a year to be at this school and my parents are not paying for my education.  I have taken numerous student loans to be at this school and the fact that you implied that I was not paying attention has deeply upset and offended me. If you truly cared about my learning, as an educator, you would know and understand that everyone learns differently. I am an intrapersonal learner and when I learn or hear about a new concept, I try to go off on a tangent in order to see where I can relate what I have seen in my own life to the actual topic at hand. Can you blame me for being curious and actively trying to seek out an answer? For example, during the case presentation for Harley, I was wondering what the MSRP of the new Livewire bike, however, you automatically assumed that I was not paying attention and as a result, I was not able to retrieve the original information that I set my eyes upon and as a result, not able to contribute as meaningful as a contribution as I would have if I did have the information that the new Livewire bike was close to 30,000 USD. Instead, your assumptions regarding my engagement have actually decreased my engagement and the quality of my contributions. Again, you CANNOT assume that because a student is not looking at the camera, that they are not listening and actively trying to intake information in order to better expand their knowledge.

264,FuriousPeanutButter,1600127951,/r/college/comments/isxbo8/how_my_addiction_to_video_games_destroyed_my/,"This is a post I wanted to make for a while. Not only to remind myself of my mistakes but to also help others by sharing my experience.

I'm studying computer science in a European University. And yes I know, ""video game addiction"" is kind of a lame subject but I see so many people affected by it. Especially students. So I figured my view on it might help a few people. 

I was always a gamer, spending a lot of hours in my youth years, until my parents told me that I should quit so I could get in a good school. And so I did. I quit gaming and focused on studying in my high school years. I was always one of the top students in my class and even though I had a tendency to procrastinate, I did well in every exam.

My university is public which means I don't have to pay anything and I'm also (currently) able to study there for as many years as I need to complete my studies without any consequences. While I was on my second year a few of my friends introduced me to PC gaming. So I built a gaming computer and started playing. And I was hooked. First it was PUBG. I started staying up late with friends so I could become the best. When I didn't play the game, I watched streamers for hours in order to learn how to become better and better. Then I found out about fortnite. At this point I was playing 10 hours a day and watching streams for 5 or 6 hours. I had 0 revenue out of it but I thought that as long as I was happy and becoming better at it, everything's ok.  


I was in my third year, I was failing all my classes and I was not helping my friends in our group projects. That was in my opinion, rock bottom. Not only did my parents see me wasting my life away, but I disappointed my friends as well. They didn't say anything much about it. But deep down I know they were so angry at me, and they were so right. Thankfully I'm lucky enough to still have them in my life.  


As my friends from my school started to quit gaming to focus on their studies, I started looking for new gaming friends. I met a few friends of a friend and we started playing together. Everything was fun again. Every time I had an assignment I would just open Fortnite and forget about anything else. I was ignoring my assignments, my studies, my future... on purpose.  At that time I started playing Rainbow6Siege. For those who don't know it's a game that requires knowledge on maps, strategies etc. So I had no other choice but to grind it. This went on for months.  


After a one-month trip to another country, free of games, I started wondering if me wasting the last 3 years of my life on games was worth it. I got back ready to live life. I quit gaming. For a month. Then I started playing again. My addiction grew and it was being fed from my pour choices. Every time I was worried about my life or my studies I just launched a game and forgot about them. When lockdown came some of my friends were begging me to stop playing and to start studying instead. ""This is your chance to make up for the last years."". Nope. I played probably 16 hours a day.  


After my latest failure in the recent exams + the fact that I got bored after having more than 4000 hours in games, I quit. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't always in my house. I was going out, drinking coffee or alcohol and had a good social life. That didn't change the fact that when I was home(most of the time), I was gaming.  


I know some of you reading this are probably thinking that this is pathetic, and it is. But I know there are people out there struggling with the same problem. Making them depressed, making them fail, making them waist their time in the sake of having fun. I'm talking to you now guys.   


* Start going to the gym. It will help you let off steam and help you relax. Competitive gaming does the complete opposite. I remember arguing with my parents because I was angry at my teammates, the game, or something else. It's not worth it. 
* Go on a trip. I would suggest going alone. If you can't do that, grab a bunch of friends and go. The longer, the better. Try to appreciate life. Try to find yourself again outside of games. 
* It's pretty obvious but... uninstall every game in your computer. Yes. Minesweeper is considered a game too.

During the last 4 years I was so frustrated when I watched youtube videos saying ""How to be productive 24/7"", ""How gaming destroyed my life"". So I get that this post might feel annoying to some of you. But if you've made it to here I know that you see my point. And hopefully you'll consider it. I don't want you guys to be productive/to make money/to finish your studies, I couldn't care less, I just want you to reconsider if it's worth spending so much time (and money) into it.",college,How my addiction to video games destroyed my studies.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/isxbo8/how_my_addiction_to_video_games_destroyed_my/,1600145951.0

It has been very stressful, but Ive been doing my best. Till mybrother gave me another breakdown. It was about a school document that was due in a week. 4 days in, I still havent done it because I found it too difficult to answer personal questions about my life. Still, that doesn't excuse me and he got pretty fucking mad. Kept reminding me every 10 minutes during and after classes. I did my best to be patient and say that I WILL get it done today, but he just kept saying ""why couldnt ylu have done it earlier then"" and honestly no matter what i said. It didnt matter. I said Im sorry, I was lazy, and that I was being swamped with school work. But he just kept fucking pushing, even if I told him that I would do it, right now. He just kept talking so i let him, and he got upset and just went off. He talked about how hard it was to lose his savings just to pay for my tuition fee. I told him Im sorry, and that I understood but he just kept saying I didnt. So I stayed silent, but that pissed him off too. 

So I just, ducking broke down. Screamed really, no wprds just straight screaming which I know he'd use to validate his opinions about me. Honestly, Ive been working so hard on college because of him, and when I told him that he got mad again, said I should be doing it all for me. I can't even remember the what was said anymore, I just broke down. I cried so hard after this 2 hr long, what ever it is and I barely got the document done. I fell asleep enduring migrains that made me feel like my head would split open.


I've just been broken ever since. I can barely get myself out of bed. I cant get anything done at all. I cant go to my classes, nor get school work done. He told me to just give up in a sarcastic tone but he meant it. And, with that I just lost any hope I had left. Any self-worth. Even he couldnt believe in me.

269,shirbert6540,1598066029,/r/college/comments/ieb5zk/marketing_or_english_degree/,"Hey, I'm an incoming college sophomore who is aiming for a marketing career (preferably in something related to writing such as copywriting, blogging, content marketing, social media management, etc.). I'm currently majoring in Marketing (and planning to graduate in 3.5 or 4 years) but I think I'd rather major in English (and then graduate in 2.5 or 3 years).

Why?

I'm frustrated by the idea of staying in college any longer than I absolutely have to (I abhor spending large amounts of money and college is, of course, expensive. Additionally, the whole system of higher education in America is morally reprehensible to me -- I've read a ton of books and articles about its corruption and it makes me sick that I'm expected/forced to be a part of it) and having to study for a degree that only teaches theoretical knowledge that I know I can learn by myself by simply reading a couple of books (which is way cheaper and more fun)!! This past spring semester that was online due to COVID also showed me that I like the independence and creativity that comes with learning things by myself much more than I like being taught in a formal classroom setting (and I'm also pretty good at it). I've always been a good (majority As, occasionally Bs) student; however, I'm sorta losing motivation for school/college (not learning; I love learning!). I feel restless and desperately want to enter the ""real world"" already. :/ Finally, my eventual goal/dream is to be self-employed. If working for myself ends up working out, then what degree I have won't matter anyway.

I figured that if being self-employed doesn't work out or if I can't get a marketing job with the English degree, then I could either work for my dad (he owns a company and would probably pay me to do marketing for him) or I could do a post-grad certificate program and become a middle school english teacher (no, not high school, I don't want to be exposed to the toxic college craze again ugh!).

According to an article I recently read from Marketing Weekly, the majority of marketers have no formal marketing qualifications such as a Marketing degree (although most marketers do have bachelor's degrees). I've also read that most marketing jobs for recent college grads are actually sales jobs, not marketing jobs, and I have absolutely ZERO interest in sales. Since you can self-study marketing online and learn a lot more practical skills than what a college degree teaches you, should I graduate early with an English degree and use that extra time and money from my college fund to invest in online self education get more practical experience in the niches of marketing that most interest me? Or should I be patient and stick it out with the Marketing degree? (I should note that I won't have student debt in either case, thank God.)

Mom had cancer and I was stuck taking care of her instead of going to school, but anyway, that's irrelevant. During my first year of college, I was kicked out of the house and moved alone to Florida to a school that cost me almost 30k a year. I did really really well away from my toxic family and got engaged... fast forward I decided to move back to my home state. Fiance and I got an apartment. I've also got to pay for my own car insurance, monthly student loans, health insurance, phone bill, etc. My mom also asks me for money and I can't refuse her because she's struggling even more than I am.

I really loved it, but of course being an out of state student, I have to pay around $16k per semester. However, I am fortunate enough to have my parents funding my college education and do not have to worry about student loans.

I've made a lot of great friends and become pretty involved, but can't say more about how integrated I got into the school since we did have to go home 1.5 months into the spring semester, and we were still freshman adjusting to college (at least I was).

I got into Virginia Tech, which would only be around $8k per semester since I'm a Virginia resident. For reference, I'm studying computer science, which both schools have a pretty good program for IMO.

Virginia Tech is somewhat opening campus and I have on in person class, versus Rutgers, which is completely online and is not allowing anyone to come back for the fall semester (which I understand). I'll probably be living off campus at VT and won't be meeting people from a dorm (even if it is lower capacity), so I'm scared about how I'll make friends. Given, I also have one in person class, but no one is probably going to be interacting a lot in that class. I don't want to be set back in terms of clubs, involvement, and friends, since I do want to be happy with my college experience.

I feel really privileged that I even get to make this choice, and don't know what I should do. Rutgers may not open for another year, which would ruin my college experience too, or do I take the plunge and see if VT might be ok after all?

I've had a rough time dealing with COVID mentally and the environment I was in played a very big part in that. I thought I had my college future all set up as I had just graduated from a local community college with my AA, focusing in Psych. I was planning to transfer to a local four year and live on campus. I busted my ass for two years to get to that point, working full time and going to school full time but I thought it would all be worth it once I got to University. Then COVID hits and now school is up in the air for the fall semester which just absolutely crushed me. I was so excited to finally get to a four year university... I'd make all these friends, join all these clubs, etc. It would have allowed me to break out of my shell and become more social. So yeah big blow to my mental health since I thought I would be escaping my current living situation and now I'm not. I have since decided to move to Texas and live with my dad in hopes my living situation will be better. Now that I have that all sorted out, I have to worry about school and my future there. I've been researching options for the last week or so. Just keep in mind, my end goal is to get as far as possible in my education with as little debt as possible (tough to do in the USA). 

1. Attend an online four year university from Texas. I've been looking at ASU online and have found a couple degrees there I would be interested in. I would like to talk to some people who have done online college like that, preferably even went to ASU or another one like it in the US. This would be rather expensive in my opinion though as you pay out of state tuition so it's like almost 20k/year for an online school. I don't know my FAFSA situation since I've been collecting unemployment during the pandemic and I'm unsure how that affects my end of the year taxes. 
2. Move somewhere out of country and get my degree abroad. I was thinking somewhere like the University of Iceland... the college tuition would be free but you have to pay yearly for student permit which is about $600 USD. So college is a lot cheaper but I would have to pay for myself to live there; average cost of living is about $1400 USD/ month. I believe you can also only work 15 hours with that student permit, which is nice but also limits your income. I don't know what wages are like out there, haven't checked yet. 
3. Wait to become a Texas resident (12 months from semester start date). If my math is right, I would have to wait 18 months to go back to school in this option. I'm afraid to do this because what if I lose my edge or study habits? Even a Community college will charge me out of state tuition so I don't think I'd do that either in those 18 months. College would be much cheaper though and in 18 months we would hopefully have COVID solved so it would be in person schooling too. 

Any advice or info you could provide on any of this would be great. I'm just having a hard time sorting it all out in my head and I can't really talk to my mom since she'll go nuts that I'm looking at schools in Iceland.

Like many, I'm really struggling accepting that my senior year won't be anything like I imagined. I'll be on campus living in my sorority house, but there are a ton of social rules about not interacting with anyone you don't live with the first month, weekly testing, no parties on or off campus (town police are notified of this policy) and we can't travel outside the county. All of my classes are online. 

I can graduate in December if I get off the waitlist for the last class I need for my major, and my parents are really pushing me to graduate to save $$.

I am planning to take a gap year and work (whether it's in an office or service-related) before going on to law school for Fall 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

I see a lot of people angry about schools deciding to go fully online or do hybrid classes and students being angry about ""being charged more for less"" or whatever the situation maybe for them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel as though a lot of students / parents / people don't realize what is happening. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Lack of Communication: 

1. State Universities are housed in the control of what's called ""[The Board of Regents](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Board+of+Regents)"" each state has their own board, and typically the president and administration takes orders from them and applies those orders to their own university - so oftentimes what you may see as ""the president screws us"" is ""the president was told by the board of regents to do this, so they did it and now they look like d\*ck heads"". In this case, a lot of what's happening is the board of regents is working with local (and probably federal) governments to attempt to create solutions for students at the colleges, and then they say ""Hey \*State Name Here\* University - We've decided you can't have students be on campus (two weeks before school starts) go deal with that."" And then your school's administration has to go deal with that. And then you as a student / parent / customer gets an email ""Sorry everyone no in-person classes, maybe next time"" and now you hate your university for their lack of communication and everything else.   

2. I'm **not** saying this is the case for all the scenarios playing out right now, but ultimately your state's board of regents has the final say on everything whether your school administration likes it or not.   

3. Even if its the board of regents that's having problems coming up with quick and concise solutions that may not be 100% on them either - government officials have a lot of stuff to on their plates right now, and schools are just 1 piece of the puzzle - it's like working on a project for someone and you can't do your part without them getting their part done, and then they give you their part 20 minutes before the projects due. You're angry at your partner and your client is like ""wtf why didn't **YOU** get **YOUR** part done???"" It's not completely fair. But that's likely the way a lot of this is right now.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Tuition Costs: 

1. A lot of students are having to deal with hybrid and / or fully online classes for some and / or all their courses and see that their tuition prices are staying the same and in some cases they're even going up (from what some people have said).   

2. I'm not sure if any of you have ever worked in the campus IT department or dealt with them before but it can oftentimes be slow and likely unsatisfactory. From my personal experience of working at mine for 2 years as a student and working closely with other IT departments from surrounding schools - I can tell you that most schools IT departments (from some reason) are extremely under-budgeted. Running internet for a University can cost upwards of 10 MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR, just to get you the student to access [google.com](https://google.com) while on campus, or for you to be able to VPN into the network to work on schoolwork or use school-related software. These budgets are spent less on employees and more on getting the stuff to work correctly - in turn giving the small teams a giant mess to deal with when something breaks, or a teacher not knowing how to open their email, etc...   

3. So what does this have to do with your tuition? Well, teachers now have to retrofit their classes to hybrid modes or fully online classes that may include expensive video gear, hosting large amounts of data on servers, training, new expensive software that often charge per student per year,  and much more.   

4. This means that the department that was already under-budgeted and underemployed now has 10x more work to get done, and in more of a deficit and is gonna have to deal with an entirely new set of problems this brings. Its all simply going to cost more to implement. Its basically as straight forward as that.   

5. I know a lot of students are going to say ""Yeah but this online stuff isn't even good, my teacher sucks and the entire way my university is doing this sucks"" - While this may be a possibility you have to remember that for the majority of the people at the University this has NEVER been done this way before and they were likely given just as much warning as you were when you received your emails about changes.  

6. Not only all of this but teachers and faculty are being laid off or getting pay decreases due to schools enrollment being down so much and one might think ""Well if they're firing people why shouldn't my tuition go down?"" Well with all the new changes they're probably losing far more money than they did last semester and they if you want your tuition lowered then they're probably going to have to fire more underpaid professors and then it'll take you half a semester to get an assignment graded and an email response them the ones that are left.  

7. Side story: Last year when my university ""announced"" that they were going fully remote until the end of the semester we at the IT department weren't even told first by the university - WE SAW A NEWS ARTICLE COME OUT SAYING WE WERE GOING TO GO ONLINE. The following day we got an email stating it and nothing was prepared at all. (Just thought this could shed some light for some people). 

 

&amp;#x200B;

This is clearly no ideal for anyone right now, it sucks and it seems like you're getting the sh\*t end of the stick - but the University and the people that work there are probably getting fried from the burnout of being overworked and underpaid, and they likely don't like it just as much as you do. Their careers and livelihoods are on the line whether it be from their contracts not getting renewed, being laid off, their entire department being downsized, etc... All because enrollments are down and massive things are being changed. 

&amp;#x200B;

If anything THEY probably want to see everything succeed the most - because if their university succeeds they'll have a stable job and can continue to live and support families in a lot of cases. Its in their best interest to do so. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying everything universities do is right by any means. But I imagine everyone is working around the clock to get answers and keep students happy - because universities **CAN** and **WILL** go under. Quite some years back my university was in a position where it almost did that and their plan was to just turn it into a hybrid campus for one of the other state universities. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully, this helped open your minds a little bit more if they weren't already. At the end of the day if you absolutely cannot deal with what's happening right now, a lot of people are taking off semesters and universities are honoring their scholarships when they return (reach out to your financial aid department and see what they can do).

So earlier today, my family dropped the bombshell on me that if the university I go to ended up shutting down and switching to online classes I would be forced to switch to a local private university to finish my degree because I wouldn't need to pay room and board and I would qualify for a decent amount of financial aid. 

I understand where my family is coming from, they think it would be safer to live at home than on campus, and not needing to pay for room and board would be cheaper than living on campus. I recognize that I'm really lucky to have parents that would help pay for something like this. However, I have my reservations about attending this university.

One of the biggest reasons why that they want me to attend this university is because it's a highly praised liberal arts college known for it's teaching programs. The thing is I haven't been able to find much of anything recently praising the school's education program (the latest I can find is from 2013) and it isn't listed on any major sites listing education programs.

I tried to give the college the benefit of the doubt and looked for the positive feedback about the school but it mostly focused on how friendly the student and faculty population was. Looking at the more frustrating things about the school though, I found several complaints about the financial aid office demanding large amounts of payment before even entering the school (well over 1000 dollars) as well as complaints about the administration focusing on enrolling students rather than helping accommodate the ones they already have. This has just left me being very uneasy about everything because I have no idea where that money is going, especially since I'm not being fully covered by financial aid.

Lastly, I asked an advisor from the school if they could provide me with a transfer equivalency report to evaluate the option of going there and it took exactly a month before I was able to get it back. Although they apologized for the delay, there was no explanation as to why it took nearly a month to send the report and I thought it seemed like they weren't being transparent at all.

Am I just overthinking this whole thing? I might be biased since I'm already attending the college of my dreams but I felt really happy attending there. Also, how can I bring up my concerns with my family?  They already know I don't like the idea of going there but I can't seem to get them to understand why...",college,Stressed at the possibility of needing to transfer to a local private school and need advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/i0h7i9/stressed_at_the_possibility_of_needing_to/,1596109079.0

I know what you're thinking. ""Does this guy hate himself?"" and the answer is yes! But I'm determined to graduate on time and have been in school long enough. I can't afford to be delayed another semester. It's simply not an option for me. I can't afford the tuition anymore and I need to start working to pay the bills. While I realize this immense pressure to not fail any courses and graduate this year will only add to my slowly conpounding stress, I'm hoping that this will also drive and motivate me to see it through. The uncertainty of Covid is also a huge driver in me wanting to get my degree and gtfo.

282,elcapitanful,1595606492,/r/college/comments/hx4dqe/50_of_whatever_tuition_you_pay_is_the_experience/,"Going onto my junior year at 20. My neighbor colleges have all decided to go online, however in my college (based around NJ) is going in person for the first few months until November where we will go full online. Besides that the classes will mix between half online/in person, online, and so on and so forth.

**My argument is despite the small talks with the science majors, the awkward hook ups at parties, the parties, or whatever social community you create - the college online subscription starting at $1,000/month is not worth it to me.** 

I have four main points and hope you will see agreement in my argument or otherwise understand my point of view.

**1 ) TRAINING/LEARNING**

Now this may not apply to more academic and online-friendly majors, but I am a performing arts major so I imagine some of you may even feel the want for an in person experience despite whatever you are training in.

As an oppose I can imagine that employers would take liking to see how prospective employees managed to be efficient during a challenge like this. This may indeed work in your favor.  In auditions, they don't give a shit - they just want your monologue.

One very important note for everyone to understand : YOU KNOW the teachers are not prepared. NOT THE UNIVERSITY, NO ONE. NO ONE WANTS TO WORK LIKE THIS. You know deep in your heart that the teachers are now unaware because they never trained for it and never had this challenge in their college days. They will half ass, and you will lose a day of fluid training over internet connection issues, let alone over the internet.

**2 ) COVID TRACING**

COVID isn't time traceable. It is getting worse, and more contagious. Yes, have everyone masks and test bi-weekly. Have them come every 14 days to quarantine, shut every interaction down. Will that stop family members? Will that stop me from meeting a friend outside of college? Is ignorance not possible?

Our college plans on returning online in November..however there is no exact projection of how COVID will hit this fall.

1 person. 10. 40. 100. Boom. School's closed. Can't open again until next year.

**3 ) COLLEGE EXPIERIENCE/INTERACTION**

College, like high school, helps you build a sense of community and interaction amongst yourself. It's like the movies, or at least it can be - wild, depressing, social, freeing. Besides that, everyone non stop talks about connections, making friends, and such. With COVID, even with going back to school for the small time, I don't think anyone would bother talking with anyone over fears.

When I graduate - I am not exactly guaranteed that anymore. As an acting major, we're not guaranteed the ensemble or a cast. We have to work - VERY HARD - to get to that and on top make a living from it. I'd move out, and have to start applying. These moments we had in college we had to work for. I could - WE could get rejected and never return to the community we are seeking for longer than anticipated. This applies to all majors - as we can't take internships for the rest of your lives. I couldn't respect myself having to live with my parents and not create an independent structure in my life. For the time I have - I just want to live in a space where I can fully create, find happiness, and **get the money's worth.**

The zoom-bombings and the ego-boost of online is another thing

Zoom-bombings are it's own thing and thankfully has died down a bit (I guess it was hitting the summer so maybe it might come back..)

The digitalized era has made it that it's easy to fuck you to a teacher instead of their face. However, this isn't the case once you graduate or even in person. You're at work, and vulnerable. You are seen in person, and not over a screen. Your hair strands and dead face is fully in the pale light. You're on stage in front of 30 people, and vulnerable. If you cry, they will see it. Is that something to be embarrassed? In the moment, but will it make you stronger?

That's the challenges we take for granted in college. The times we fuck up or triumph becomes far greater in person. You become your real self because there is no place to really hide when you're there. Online you could just turn off your video.

Point is, even back to earlier, we become better, stronger, and more ""real"" by existing in person. Not to sound dramatic, but we are surrendering to the digital that we complained of so much. Now imagine returning back after months of online.

**4 ) POTENTIAL OF GAP YEAR**

If a vaccine hypothetically comes out in January, and the country gets their shit together, the opportunities from before will return. You could even just travel in the countries we all reside in. We could volunteer at peace corps. Learn to play Clair De Lune. Run a marathon (I just ran a 5k three days ago, 13th place. Trained during quarantine.) No complaints if you spent it speed running Majora's Mask or stayed at home.

This may not even apply to some of you, as you need the degree now or just want to finish it. I just ask you that you ponder this over. I am an enemy to the college state yes, but I just think we all deserve the fullest potential of our life, young or mature.

It may seem like one year, and with talks of a vaccine maybe less, but it may not be one year for all of us. It could be an eternity of happiness that could be right there. RIGHT there!

-Nobody knows how strict these rules will be. The contract states that breaking them can be punished with anything from a warning to expulsion.

-If you leave the county, you must quarantine in a separate single room in the designated quarantine building for 2 weeks minimum

My situation:

-I am living with one friend, one rando, and an empty room in an apartment

-All my other friends are in different buildings, so I can't see them. I haven't seen them in a year (bc of co-op then study abroad)

-My one roommate friend will probably bail and take classes from home, leaving me with one rando in a 4 person apartment

-I have a friend with an extra room in his frat house in a different state that I could move into. I'd take classes online if I do this

-I don't pay tuition so idc whether I take classes on or offline, but housing is ~$4000 on campus

If you were me, would you decide to live on campus and see how strictly the rules will be enforced, or into the extra room in my friend's house?

Months before the class I emailed the professor to ask if he would allow me to just take the Final exam in this class since I'd already taken all the quizzes from my previous attempt. May, June, July... he has not responded!

Today was the first day of class and I was the only one with my video camera on, I doubt he recognized me because he didn't acknowledge me, actually, he doesn't acknowledge any student whom he considers to be a waste of his time by not grasping the material immediately, as evident by his Rate My Professor Reviews and what I observed in my first semester in his class.

The man has put 0 effort into planning and preparing the class for online learning. I understand this is a public university but that is no excuse for this gross level of laziness and nonchalance. Lets go over the list of all his failings as a Professor:

**Zoom:** Class meetings are held on zoom at a particular time. This is the first transgression. What about people who are essential workers? What are they supposed to do? What if someone has an emergency, we are in the middle of a pandemic after all! Why not record the lectures and post them so we can watch them at our convenience? No he would rather slog through 3 hours of him rambling and asking the class ""Didn't they teach you that in Calculus I?"" He is very arrogant and likes to show off on his students. We know you can do the problems, that's why your the Professor, we wanna see if you can show US how to do them, that's why you are here!

**Low visibility**: He writes on a physical white board captured by his not so good camera; I can hardly see anything. Whats worse Professor is not the most dainty person so his belly can obstruct critical parts in the equation that need both narration and visuals to be effectively taught.

**Recorded Quizzes**: I'd love to see how he's going to pull this off, because he said he didn't know how to upload the recordings of our sessions so I wonder if he can figure out how to get blackboard to record much less function properly. I think he's a hypocrite because he can't upload a video but he can get quizzes to record in blackboard, something I've never seen any other CUNY Professor do, even the ones with excellent online formatted courses.

**He's a Boomer:** Self Explanatory. Any effort to make a suggestion to him will be seen as an 'Attack' or 'Disrespectful'. Plus he is tenured so he could literally do no teaching and no one would bat an eyelash. He is a smart man, he teaches calculus after all, he knows what to do to make students learn he is just too lazy and doesn't care.

*I hate him.* I hate this stupid school and that's why this is my last semester here at this branch of CUNY. I am definitely gonna cheat in this class and just get it out of the way, if the professor can't even be bothered to put 10% effort or preparation then I am not going to stress myself out trying to do his job. We meet  3x a week for 3 hours so that's 9hrs a week of my life I will never be getting back and I'm not even getting anything back in return for it. At least if I were at a job they'd pay me my slave wage and I could use it to buy food and better shelter, I might not get anything out of this Degree for all I know.

287,Last_Hallucination,1594522701,/r/college/comments/hpn8sd/how_can_i_stop_eating_my_roommates_food/,"Before I say anything; yes, I know I'm an asshole for eating my roommate's food, but I want to stop that habit.  
TLDR: I'm sleep eating and eating out of stress, Roommate and I don't have the money + patience for my shit anymore.  
Ok now that I pointed out the obvious I have huge trouble from stopping myself from eating my roommate's food (let's call her A). A and I are related; she's my first cousin and we're close as could be. She's been there for me for such a long time and she's basically my second mother (she's 35, I'm 20). She was so kind as to let me be roommates with her (rent free!) once I graduated high school, and I'll always be grateful for that. For the first year or so I considered myself to be a decent roommate; 99% of the time I was diligent about cleaning up my mess, cleaning the house and never ate her food unless she told me I could have some of her food (of course there was a few times I'd forget or she'd positively encourage me to clean up. Good ol' psychotic depression I guess).   
Around December of 2019 was when things started getting worse. To keep things simple my therapist increased my dose of quetiapine because I started hallucinating and he casually mentioned the fact that there's a small chance my hunger may increase: A and I thought it was no biggie, like what are the chances that would happen? Hell she even joked around saying that it would be good if my hunger increased since at that point I barely ate. Yeahhhh turned out that the increase made my stomach turn into a black hole; I found myself going through my own groceries more, but it was semi-okay because I had a job so I could just budget more out for food. Then the pandemic hit. By March I found myself being layed off and unable to get unemployment, while my cousin's workplace found themselves with my workers quitting. To say it was high-stress would be a bit of an understatement and not only had I found my depression to worsen but A's depression and stress was worsening as well. Her house went from a relaxing safe place to a high-tension place, and to make things worse my depression meds just stopped working all of a sudden. I've been trying to find work online but it's like as soon as a job's posted it's already been taken. Also around this point in time A and I found out I've been sleep eating.   
I'll skip to now just so this won't be as long as 5 [novels.](https://novels.As) As of this month my depression's at an all time low, my psychiatrist referred me to a different one back in May and it's been \~3 months since i've heard anything, my sleep eating's gone out of control, A's house now has multiple things going wrong in her house which she can't afford to fix (water heater broke down, squirrels and mice have found their way into the attic, stove is one step away from bursting into flames) and her a\*\*hole boss won't give A her bonus pay and actually told her ""well you should learn to budget better"" even though A's been working \~11$/hour for 5 years now (and imo seems to be her boss's best worker but that's another story), A's depression has gone out of control, we've already had our first big fight in a long time, and I'm now I'm eating everything out of stress. I think we may end up fighting again soon if I don't stop eating her food, she's already insulting me and I know it's only going to escalate if I don't stop it. Thing is I haven't figured out how to stop. I know 80% of this problem if from the quetiapine, so I tried to just go to sleep as soon as I take it and put as many things as I can in front of my door (There's no lock on it and it doesn't shut properly); this hasn't worked yet. I tried lowering my dose to where it was before it got increased but my anxiety just got worse and I started hallucinating again so that was a no-go. Do any of you guys have any suggestions?

He has always struggled with motivation and discipline due to some mental health problems, but I am worried it is affecting his academic life and possible future career and I don't know what to do. 

Basically, I just found out that he failed two classes this semester, and his GPA went down to a 2.4 (he also failed a class first semester), he never told me himself because he was ashamed, I only found out because his college account is logged in on my computer. Since his GPA is so low, he lost his merit scholarship and is now on probation for the honors program that he is in. 

I know he had a rough time his first year, his mental health was at its lowest and I did everything I could to try and keep him on his feet, get him to go to class and do his work. But since we moved to online classes there really was nothing I could do to make sure he was turning in all the work, which is why he failed and his grades went down, because he didn't do any of the work. I try to be as patient and supportive as I can but it's honestly really sad and frustrating seeing him throw all his potential out the window. He is really smart, he was top of his class on HS but he can't focus or do work that he doesn't find ""interesting"" so he just neglects it. He is an undecided major so he's always saying that the classes are boring and that's why he can't bring himself to do the work. 

The thing that worries me the most is the scholarship, he lost a lot of money just because he couldn't get his act together and I don't know how he is going to make up for that money for next semester. 

I suffer from many different mental health disorders as well and I am by no means comparing my situation to his because we all deal with it in different ways, but I honestly can't comprehend why he is just throwing away such a good opportunity. He is attending a really good private school and he is drowning in loans to afford to pay for it and yet he's wasting all his time in nothing. He comes from a poor family, so a degree or a good education can take him so many places and I know he wants that but he just doesn't seem to care enough to work hard for it. All he seems to care about is playing videogames and smoking or getting drunk with his friends (no, he doesn't have a substance abuse problem), but I genuinely don't know what to do anymore. I know I'm not his mom but I care about him and I want him to have a good future, but I really don't know how to help him.

I was in the high school class of 2019. Fall 2019 I completed 9 credits and spring 2019-20 I ended up dropping out. This summer I then enrolled back into the Uni that I dropped out of, but I'm wondering if it is too late to be applying rn, or if there are schools that have rolling admissions that I can have a shot at. 

The Uni that I attended.. I didn't like it from the beginning. I liked nothing about it, the only thing that kept me there that long was/is the fact that they pay for 75% of my tuition. But it is an incredibly racist and conservative PWI. They don't even try to hide it. I had a horrible experience. But i'm torn between dealing with it and basically having my tuition paid, or going elsewhere to have an overall better college experience.. in all aspects. I will apply/go to any uni in any state of America as long as I know I'll like it and be valued there. 

Also... no one in my family wants me to go back there. Everyone is willing to work a little more to make ends meet for me to go somewhere else.. I'd basically be going against my family by going back because they reeeaaalllyyy don't want me back there, but I can't see myself being accepted anywhere rn and idk if im willing to take another semester off, I'm already 'behind' (yes ik we all go at our own pace, but I'm eager to finish my schooling life) 

Another thing that's worrying me is *even if*  I do get accepted to another college, it would mean I'd be getting the scrapes of everything. The bad dorms, classes with profs no one wants to take, etc. And also.. with corona a lot of schools had to change how they're doing things.. and I can already foresee the big confusion that's about to plague everyone. of course I'd prefer to be somewhere that's familiar in the midst of all the confusion, but at the same time, this could be a great time to transfer so that I deal with that change right along with everyone else.",college,Great Colleges With Rolling Admissions and High Acceptance Rates?

People get confused why I'm going to school because ""this is a career for most people.""

Last semester I worked 2.5 days/week and was taking 3 classes (8 credits + an upgrading course). This coming semester I'm planning on taking 10 credits and working 2 days. 

Every weekday last semester I was either at school or work, in my time off in addition to school work and studying I would need to tackle housework, car maintenance, yard work, grocery shopping, food prep, etc. plus I was doing a 1+ hour round trip commute to school 3 days a week and often got home at like 7.

I'm considering quitting my job next year going into 2nd year. On one hand I'd be giving up that income and a good fall-back plan.

I myself (*AE major, rising sophomore*) am considering staying home and doing my courses online, but it seems like almost everyone else is going back to campus. I just can't bring myself to pay rent and full tuition for online classes, especially when I will likely be inside 24/7 and not socializing, so I am looking into subleasing and staying home for the coming school year.

I know everyone has a different situation, so I want to get a gauge for what people are planning on doing; maybe its FOMO keeping me from making a decision. Is it a bad idea to give my lease to someone else, and stay home for the next year while taking my classes online?

Also, I am hesitant as I know I will be missing out on a full year's worth of research opportunities and design team involvement. I didn't get involved with either last school year as I had a bit of a difficult time getting acclimated to college, and wanted to ensure my whole focus was on my classes. Will this affect me too badly?

I am not tooo worried about missing out on social life, as I am about missing out on opportunities to further my experience and make myself a better candidate when it comes to finding a career. Anyone else in the same boat? How can I improve on this, and is there anything I can do on my own at home?

There are ""technical courses"" which are field of study specific that we can enroll in and it doesn't require any exams, and then after you complete it you can enter a bachelor degree of your choice without doing any exams.

However, the downside is, you have to take this course for 2 years and learn everything I already did and I will also probably not get past math.

My goal is to study for a BFA in order to pursue illustration and potentially work for an animation studio, but I do not feel as if I am at the right school. Firstly, I never wanted to begin my higher education at this university. Hundreds of dollars were spent applying to *thirteen* other institutions, most of which were private art schools like MICA and SCAD. I was accepted to all of them, was granted seemingly generous scholarships that ultimately could not cover enough for my family to take a loan out for. I'm only at my current school because my grandparents live nearby; they only agreed to pay for me to go to school at all so long as I went to this particular one and lived with them. 

Here I am one year later and I feel hopeless. This school mainly serves pre-med, law, communications, and business majors. Art seems very low on the tier, though that's not to say the department is entirely worthless. However, the foundational courses I've taken are clearly geared toward students who are just filling out credits while they focus on their major. I don't feel like I've been taught anything worthwhile. Thus, I want to leave and have lied about it to my family for an entire year. Lied about liking my classes, about enjoying the campus, about living where I'm at. But I'm done. 

That's all to say an opportunity seems to have presented itself to me. I am free for the summer and I have the chance to fly up to D.C. to live with my father (yes, I'm well aware of the risk) to attend community college. My plan would be to knock out my pre-requisites, find a job to pay off my loans, eventually move out and apply to an art school in the area (MICA is number one on my list).

I want to build my portfolio up and go to a school I know I can network in and learn from professors in the workforce I want to join. I'm not saying this is a surefire road to success -- I'm not even saying I'll end up in art school --but I also can't stay here. This city is not for me, this school is not for me, and my mental health has suffered because of it. It's even as simple and selfish as just wanting to live somewhere else, but I know I want to keep my education going the way *I* choose. I don't want to feel powerless anymore.

I'm about to go into my fourth year of college at the University of Kentucky and I decided to switch my major from music performance to media arts and sciences. Before anyone says anything about me waiting so late to switch my major; trust me, I have my reasons. I decided to go this route because for me personally I can't afford to only focus on music and be able to pay bills and live the life that I want to live. It also became apparent to me that you don't need a college degree to be a musician or to play music. I figure there must be another way to keep myself involved with art and being creative while establishing a career that can actually support what I'd like to be able to do with music in the future.

I don't really know a lot about the major other than the career paths that I could choose from like Film and Audio Production, Graphic Design, Telecommunications Management, so on and so forth. I'm hoping that someone could give some insight about what I can expect to be studying and what opportunities could present themselves for where I might end up working once I have my degree. I'm also minoring in music performance and psychology if that matters at all to anyone.

I've also been really interested in computer science and I'm wanting to get more into web development, data analysis, and possibly network administration if it's possible for me to ever go that route. I tried to add a minor in computer science but my school denied me into the college of engineering because I don't have the requirements met for enrollment. I'm trying to teach myself how to program and my hope is that having that skill set along with my major might make me a valuable asset to the tech industry or wherever I decide to go after I graduate. If anyone has any input as to what I can do have a better chance at success before and/or after I graduate please don't hesitate to reply to this post.

I've been looking at legal assistant, admin assistant, marketing such and such stuff but I'm kind of too timid to be a good secretary or salesperson. I really suck at interviews too. Legal assistant jobs in particular ask for a shitton of experience, usually in a really narrow area of law. Some people close to me have told me I could learn some tech skills and get a job as a data analyst or developer, which is what the majority of jobs in my area are (take 5 seconds and guess where it is lol). The issue is all these positions ask for a CS degree or related, which wasn't an option for me because the CS program at my college has like a 5% acceptance rate, and students must be accepted into the program as freshmen.

I was one of the fastest and smartest students in kindergarten, learnt to age at age 3 and was the first one in class, etc. All of that changed when my parents couldn't pay for private schooling anymore so I had to attend classes at this horrible elementary school. I got behind maths at age 10 and I couldn't catch up properly ever since. My math teachers were terrible and taught everything mechanically, never explaining the process behind the solutions/train of thought. I felt useless and dumb, some of my peers were extremely good at maths, and that mostly was because their parents taught them at home, mine didn't because they hated maths. Most of my classmates absolutely hated the subject, though. I guess that was because it was horribly taught. They never gave us problems to solve, they just taught us arithmetic and that was it. My brain felt slow and sluggish, I was always behind my peers since then.

Fast forward to high school, it was also a mess (regarding maths). As I couldn't improve my analytical skills, I started getting really good at memorising things, I spoke 5 languages with no hassle in high school (the ones they taught us there). For some reason I had already learnt the ways of teaching maths in high school, which was the mechanical way, so I was, and this is what my teacher said, the best math student in my last year of HS. But here's the catch, I didn't know why the exercises were solved that way, nor why they chose that formula over that one, things like that. I just did it the way my teachers taught me to. And I dragged that until now. I'm at uni, I'm a year behind because I'm taking it easy for my sluggish brain, and I did good at most of my first year classes, but maths is still a problem for me. Everything is harder, and even though I understand most exercises, the ones in exams are really hard and I can't do them without assistance. I hate asking for help in these exercises, just doesn't feel genuine whenever I solve them. I'm scared I won't ever be able to be good at math and drop out because I'm slow. I don't want to, I love computers and everything about them, and engineering is amazing but I don't think I'll ever be able to be as good as the things I see on the net, nor even get to be a mediocre one. I don't want to drop out because of that, and end up taking language teaching classes because languages don't fulfill me, they bore me. 

I tried to go back to the basics in khan academy but I forget everything I learn, and I don't know why that happens.

Please abstain from replying ""just drop out"", ""take comp sci instead"" (we don't have that in my city), etc. It's not constructive.

I'll be doing a BA in Humanities, the Arts and Social Thought, but I'm planning to major in ethics and politics. By accepting this however, I turned down four international relations and geography courses from well known universities in the UK (UCL, King's, SOAS, QMUL), with cost mainly being the reason. Whilst financially I'm making a good decision, everything I've read has basically slated liberal arts degrees, and some people are judging me for accepting it, along the lines of ""I thought you were smarter/better than that, why are you getting a useless degree?"". 

The thing is I really want to get a post-graduate degree (most likely master's but possibly a phd) in an area related to international relations and development, and want to work the for UN or the civil service, so I'm viewing this liberal arts degree as a kind of stepping stone. A large chunk of graduates from the college I will be attending do go on to graduate school for areas like this (including UChicago, NYU, Oxford, SciencesPo etc), hence my interest in it. From my perspective, by accepting this offer and doing a liberal arts degree I can work and save more money, and put this towards doing a graduate degree, as well as coming out with minimal debt. The school is also really big on internships (compulsory to do a long one in third year and encouraged to shorter ones in second year) and study abroad programmes, and my scholarship would also cover these, so I would be able to apply to (and afford to attend) some interesting programmes, which I think could be really valuable, and override the fact I have a liberal arts degree if I have good experience.

At the same time, I'm scared about something changing? What if I decide suddenly I don't want to go to grad school/something happens so I can't? Am I now stuck with a useless, unemployable degree? Am I going to be the laughing stock of the academic world?

Short version: I m 19, went on a leave with no intent of going back to school because of mental and physical health problems. While I was away, I started a business in a very different field and it did exceptionally well in a short amount of time. I love what I do and I ve been making crazy amounts of money so far. Even better is that I don t feel depressed or physically ill anymore. I also love that I can make time to be with my family/friends and travel. 

After hs, I got a full ride to a very prestigious college and I was pursuing a degree in engineering. Sounds cheesy but I feel like a lot of kids in my community look up to me as a role model and I feel like I m representing my community in pretty much everything I do. I don t want to set a bad example for younger ones and I want to make good use of this opportunity. I also don't have much of a life outside college so it s been hard adjusting. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pros of dropping out:

1. I d be happier and in good physical and mental health. 

2. I can run my business. 

3. I will have the time and energy to travel, do the things i love and live freely

&amp;#x200B;

Cons of dropping out: 

1. I'm not making the most out of the opportunities I have. 

2. Two years of college wasted. I can't use what I learned in class to find a career-type job unless I have a degree. 

3. It would be very hard to establish a career in my field (engineering) without the education. 

4. It's hard to get a full ride and I may never get an opportunity like that if I ever wanted to go back to school. 

5. This may sound weird to some but I attended a top ranked college. They almost never pick from my school district and I was the first to be picked to attend in over 15 years. Thus, I feel like I am not just representing myself, but also representing kids from my school district. I don't want to be the one case that reaffirms their long standing decision to not pick from my area by showing them that I can't graduate. I'm pretty sure I didn't explain that very well but I hope you get what I mean. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pros of staying in school:

1. Finish my degree and get a nice, high paying job through connections. 

2. Maintain a good social life and interact with peers. 

3. I grew up in a disadvantaged community so I would be setting a good exampe for my siblings and representing my community positively. This is very important to me as I feel like I am a voice in my community and it's very important that I set an example especially so my younger siblings can be motivated to go to college.

&amp;#x200B;

Cons of staying in school: 

1. Mental and physical anguish - I was too ill to leave my house for 75% of the last semester I was there. I go to school in a place that's very cold and very far from home. I don't like the cold and I got pretty ill and depressed because of it. Some days I couldn't move from my bed and I didn't want to bother my mom back home about it. It was scary being sick, unable to be up and about, and locked indoors because of the cold.

2. Financial instability and student debt. If I went back, part of my full ride would be taken away. It would be a struggle to pay my bills and I'd graduate with loans. 

3. I hate it and I feel miserable when I'm in school. I have considered transferring but I wouldn't get financial aid if I transferred and because I didn't go to class much when I was there, my GPA is very very low and I wouldn't qualify for a transfer anyway.

I am 27 and just recently started college part time as I have to work full time. Most of the scholarships I've found so far are for high school graduates (I graduated in 2010) or people going to college full time. 

On the occasion I do find one I am eligible for, It seems like I can't sign up without having to create an absurd amount of accounts for websites I am never going to use again. Is that normal? People who have actually received scholarships, is that what your process was like? I feel very overwhelmed and to be honest a bit discouraged. 

Scholarship owl seemed like a good choice but then I realized I have to pay to use the website.

And now the scandal that is taking place on reddit. Students who perhaps have no means for a computer, are taking their exams on Nintendo Switches, Play Station, or even Xbox, and then being shot down for using that browser. America once again, is kicking out people for being plain poor. 

Let me make this clear ***Any company that infests your router, webcam, or any personal device with tracking software without your consent is plainly illegal.*** To my understanding, other than browser lockdown, there is nothing they can do. 

There are a million and one reasons to abolish CollegeBoard all together, but in private enterprise America, the only way to do so is to provide schools with a better, cheaper option. 

Here is what I am proposing, maybe set up a discord server, or perhaps, leave a comment with what you think. 

I think to tackle this correctly, we need to fight it at the core. 

**Students take AP Exams and SAT for 3 reasons:**

1. College credit
2. School Admissions
3. Scholarship

I was once a AP student, I actually went into an AP course against my will, and was told I can't drop out. But once I was in, there was little correlation between physics (AP Physics) and the class. It was centered on the exam. So no, students don't take these courses to ""deeper"" their understanding in a subject you enjoy. It's just another 5 miles in the rat race. 

So all we need to do is build a better exam for these 3 reasons. 

***1) College Credit***

We can depend on existing courses for that. For example, for AP US history, we ask that colleges and universites either provide the final exam, or course syllabus. We then with the help of others, take all this national data and make a comprehensive exam for it. 

**This keeps the exams extremely related to actual college course material. Why rewrite exams, when it's already done every semester on a national level.**

***2) School Admission***

This is probably more realated to the SAT part of the program. The SAT all it is, is a exam for college readiness. This, can be solved by asking actual college admission officers. It would be based on tiers. Say we make the scores out of 10,000. Ivy leagues would prefer to see a student fluent in calculus. Community college couldn't care less. 

**From this, we create a spectrum of actual relative data. We are not making shit out of our ass, whats on these exams, are what colleges themselves requested.** 

***3) Scholarship***

This is probably the easiest to tackle, once schools begin to adopt this new community-driven exam, scholarships will quickly acknowledge its existence

\-----------

I am not saying this will not have flaws, but is sure as hell would be much better than the shit show we have now. CollegeBoard has financial incentive to keep students failing. 

If most students say score about a certain threshold, the exam seems too easy, thus decrease reliability, thus decrease sales. They have to always achieve the bell curve. We have no idea how they grade students, and after grading, pay to see what we got wrong? No, we can do better. 

This is not a new idea, or format. Open source projects run the world. Android, Linux, Programming, are all small examples of a community-run world. Where the community makes decisions as a whole and my God how successful that has been. 

Please, would love to hear your input if this is worth pursuing.",college,"Maybe it's time for a open-source, industry led, replacement to college board",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/gk3gfq/maybe_its_time_for_a_opensource_industry_led/,1589539971.0
312,451757,1589252388,/r/college/comments/gi2phj/does_transferring_to_another_college_reset_sap/,"I just finished my second semester at my current college. Long story short: I originally enrolled at this school in 2014 and had to dropout shortly after, but I didn't withdraw right which put me in a  warning. This past fall was my first full semester, which I passed with all As and one B. This semester, spring 2020, I passed with straight As. My cumulative GPA is 3.84.

Here's what's breaking my heart and stressing me out: when I registered for my fall classes, the advisor didn't guide me right which resulted in my not being registered for enough credit hours. So, despite passing my classes, I got put into a failing SAP status. I had to drain my savings to pay for this semester - spring. I triple checked with the advisor I was assigned to this time when I registered for classes and the financial aid office itself in January right when classes started to make sure I was registered for enough hours this time to put me in good standing. The resounding answer was ""yes, as long as you pass all of your classes."" I worked my butt off and passed all of my classes, as mentioned above, with straight As. BUT here's the kicker. The calculation they did with my overall attempted hours between all 3 semesters, the one in 2014 that I dropped out of and these past 2 semesters (38 hours) multiplied by the 67% completion rate I needed came to me needing to complete 25.46 hours. Between these past two semesters, I would only have 25 hours.They told me the .46 would drop off and the 25 completed hours would be fine.

Well, this semester ends and their program keeps me in a failing SAP status over that .46 that apparently didn't drop off. I have contacted them until I'm blue in the face and the person I did get ahold of told me that she would manually fix it for me and put me as passing because I am under one full point from passage so that allows her to make an adjustment. She hasn't fixed it though. I don't know what to do. I have emailed her again asking - politely - if anything is wrong with fixing my status, but I haven't heard back. I worked hard, did everything they told me to do, and I still get screwed over.. twice!

So this is my question:
Will my SAP status reset if I transfer to another community college? From what I googled, it says that is a loophole and that I could start with a fresh good standing status which would make me eligible for full aid again.

Thoughts? I can't pay for another semester out of pocket.",college,Does transferring to another college reset SAP?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/gi2phj/does_transferring_to_another_college_reset_sap/,1589270388.0

We've been quarantining it up since it was announced, and haven't let another soul into the apartment. Of course, we've gone to go grocery shopping and whatnot. It's been a good month and a half since quarantine started.

Recently, one of my roommate's girlfriend wants to essentially move back in (she went home, one state over once the situation started). She's not formally on the lease, and she also doesn't pay rent, during school she comes over during the day and sleeps at her place about half the time. Me and the other roommates are very cool with her.

But, because of quarantine, I'm the only one that doesn't want her to move back in with us. Basically because it's against everything social distancing is. 

Arguments:
- It's been a month and a half, if she had covid, she doesn't have it anymore (do we know for sure?)
- Her home life is really not the best, her parents are abusive. This I know is a fact, and its really the only fact that makes me feel like the asshole here. My argument against this is why doesn't she move back into her own apartment (which she still has a lease on), and there's only 2 people living there right now. 
- We go out to get groceries all the time, what's the difference?

Basically, I don't want her to come back, at least to our apartment (she plans on coming back in 2 weeks): 
1) Because quarantine
2) The apartment is really only meant for 3 people, but we shoved 5 guys in it. I'm in a triple with the boyfriend in question (so if she comes back, she's sleeping in my room).

She can go back to her apartment, sure, but the boyfriend will be visiting her quite often, which I'm not sure how I feel about to be honest. He additionally will not move in to her apartment because her roommates are sticklers. 

I have basically zero leverage because I can't go back home (across the country, no way I'm taking a plane right now), and I can't get an airbnb to isolate myself because no money. My other roommates don't care, except for one who's a premed. The boyfriend is whipped, so he's not gonna tell her no.

317,grahamalondis,1588102582,/r/college/comments/g9twm9/im_graduating_with_a_bachelors_and_a_40_in_two/,"So I'll start off by saying that a 4.0 goal GPA isn't going to be worth it to you unless you want to go to a top-20 law school or graduate program (in which cases you can still get in with 3.8 and lower). Law school has been my goal, and now that I'm in the thick of prep I do not regret any of it at all. Law schools count A+s toward GPA, so my law school apps will list my GPA as 4.07: this is well above even the 75th percentile GPA for admitted students at Harvard, Yale and Stanford; in other words, because I worked so hard, all I need is a great LSAT score and I can go to the best law schools with major scholarships, perhaps even some full-rides at some schools. Sometimes it pays! But again, don't shoot for a 4.0 unless you have the highest goals. 


That said, don't blow off your GPA either. I've gotten really good scholarship money and named awards such as a faculty endowed scholarship that's really nice to have on a resume (I was the one person at my CC to receive the award). But you have to apply—most people don't make the effort and miss out big time.


There was also one instance when DegreeWorks was not displaying my classes correctly and my advisor was telling me I needed more classes than I had thought. I insisted something was wrong and she figured it out manually. She said for most students she would have probably blown off those claims, but because my grades were perfect she knew I wasn't pulling stuff out of thin air. You really never know in what ways it might help you.



Okay! Enough with that. Onto the general stuff.



Community college

Start at CC if your parents aren't paying your way. Some are better than others, but most CCs are the exact same education. A lot of my CC profs also worked at the university I transferred to. Don't get hung up on ""the college experience."" It's not completely bullshit but it's mostly bullshit. It's what convinces you to live on campus for 4 years and pay 4 years of tuition. The savings are significant and will shorten/lower your student loan payments. If you're at college/going to college to socialize, you're in the wrong place. There's plenty of ways to make friends without spends tens of thousands in extra money.


Quick note on loans: many students don't understand that unsubsidized loans start accruing interest immediately. Borrow carefully.


Be Aware of Benefits

Make sure that if you have a parent who is a veteran that you have fully explored benefits. I'm in Texas and part of a big family. Our first two college grads didn't know that Hazelwood could exempt their tuition. So only one sister and I have used the exemption. We both paid CC out of pocket so between the two of us we didn't even used all the exempted hours in the benefit. My little brother is at CC now and will use the rest of the credits when he transfers. Between the 3 of us we will have collectively spent around 15K for 3 associate's and bachelor's degrees. That's before you count the scholarships and grants. Because my family is not wealthy (good grant $), and because of my dad's military benefits, and because of my scholarships, I've actually been PAID TO GO TO SCHOOL. This isn't going to be the situation for most people—my point is that you shouldn't be like my two older siblings who didn't know what they were entitled to. 




Gen Ed's/Core Curriculum

These are generally hated and blown off. I get it, you think you know all this stuff already. The truth is that you don't. Being smart isn't knowing everything, it's knowing when you don't know something and then doing what you can to learn more. What I think really helped me was how open I was to all the gen eds. I would always find a way to connect the content of each class (1) to my life and (2) to all the classes I'm taking and often those I've taken before. Not only does this help you make sense of the world but it also helps you remember the content of each class—this will help you in life and help you ace future courses as you build your knowledge. Doing this helps your brain form connections, and knowledge that has multiple connections is easiest to access. In short, view gen eds as opportunities. There's always something you don't know or a connection you haven't made.


Majors and Careers

You'll hear a lot that you don't need to know everything before you start, and that's true. That first year is a time to explore your options. I went in as a Psych major and came out an English major who now loves books and writing. However, the rubber meets the road your second year. You don't have to know your exact job yet, but you need to settle on a major ASAP to avoid taking fall through classes, paying extra money for school, and delaying your graduation. It's not a good time. And to that end, you should figure out your exact career as a senior and shape class projects around your career specialties. For example this semester I've been doing a legal-based project.


Study Abroad

If you are remotely interested in study abroad, do it in your first year and a half. You won't have too much of your degree plan filled in, which allows you to fill gen eds abroad or take on some electives. I did study abroad my last semester of CC. I had to take one fall through class to get to go because my plan was too full. They're also different lengths—mine was only 2 weeks abroad. I had a scholarship pay most of the costs and my CC had a program that gave people free summer tuition for being full time the previous two semesters. I paid almost nothing to go because I used that faculty endowed scholarship to cover almost all the ~$1000 leftover to pay. Look into it! There's a lot of scholarship money available for it and especially at CC it isn't costly at all.



Studying

I don't think I'm smarter than my average classmates. I just wanted it enough to genuinely make an effort for every assignment. This means *doing the reading*.Make a schedule that works for you. You might have to sacrifice some things here and there, but that's a cost/benefit calculation for you to make. Just give everything a real effort and make the connections I already talked about. For really tough classes, I'd always read the optional texts and sometimes seek out extra books to help me understand (Spanish was a real bitch). I personally found group study distracting and unproductive for me, but do what helps you.



Classes Everyone Should Take

1. Technical Writing/Business Writing: no matter your major, this class teaches important skills such as cover letters, *good* resumes, business reports, and other types of documents you WILL need to write effectively. I honestly think this class should be listed as a gen ed.



2. Business Applications/MS Office
A lot of people know this stuff. But this is your chance to learn more about MS Excel/spreadsheets. Basically everything job these days requires spreadsheet knowledge.


Non-liberal arts majors: take some kind of writing-intensive course. Everyone needs to write better. Most people do not write well at all. This is especially important if your major doesn't usually allow for professor interaction. Professors who read your writing typically get to know you better than a professor who doesn't. These classes are great networking opportunities to build relationships with professors who can write great letters of recommendation for you and might even reach out to you with jobs (they both know you and are highly skilled writers). If you can't bring yourself to take one, show up to office hours whether you need help or not. I've had multiple professors come to me with job opportunities, and I'm close to enough of them that I'm having a hard time choosing which ones to write my LORs for law school. They're major resources for you. Don't waste it! I had a personal rule of *at minimum* making sure every single Prof knew me by name.



Make Friends

I made a lot of friends in my classes, but I wish I'd made even more. They can help you get through this experience in one piece and remain friends long after (I still talk to friends who graduated before me). Make friends in your major classes especially because you need to start making professional connections right away. Clubs and other volunteering options are also good for this: I wish I were able to do these things more, but between school and working to live I just didn't have the time to do very often.



Working

Everyone's situation is different, but I ended up with a really flexible driving job for an incredible company. It paid great for the type of work and didn't drain my mental energy. I'd also often use podcasts and audio books to make up for missed study time. It's definitely beneficial to work in your career field, but often these positions are mentally draining and do not pay well and are not flexible.



Internships

Work at least one of these before you graduate. Unpaid work sucks, but when the hiring choice is you with no internship vs. another student with an internship, that other student is getting the job 9/10 times



Research and Publishing

Try to undertake at least one MAJOR project. It doesn't have to be a thesis, but make something at some point that is significant work that you can add to your portfolio. You can also submit this work or other work to journals. Being published is huge to have on a resume, especially for grad school or professional school. I researched and wrote this huge project about my school, but its contents were way too sensitive to publish anywhere. Oh well. You can also submit your work to your school's or a nearby school's research conference. I ended up winning 1st place prize for work that I submitted on a whim.



That's about all I can think of right now. Feel free to ask questions if there's something I didn't cover.


All in all, college has been a truly life changing experience, and my confidence has gone from the lowest lows to the highest highs. Enjoy the experience, socialize (if you want to) make friends, and have fun. Just don't forget that you're there to learn and to advance your career.



PS I'll add that liberal arts gets a lot of hate, but it's mostly founded on job outcomes. There's so much that I've learned in these courses and so much that I've read that has totally changed the way I look at the world and life in general. Keep in mind that there's plenty of stuff worth learning even if it isn't relevant to your career.

I'll also recognize that not all of this will be helpful to everyone. I've been incredibly fortunate these 4 years.

It seems kind of shady to ask people to commit to someplace when they won't tell students what fall will hold.

We need to look at the bigger picture here. There are cases where the student didn't study enough and got bad grades and now the student refuses to except responsibility so the student blames everyone else.

However, there are also cases where the student is correct in assessing that the teacher genuinely does not like the student and purposefully gives bad grades. This scenario requires proof. Also the student needs to mentally reflect why the teacher does not like him, what events lead to this, and what he can do in the future, and/or how to build better relationships with people.

This is a story about Professor Aly (not real name). Professor Aly got a biology lecturer position at a top tier uni in the USA. She can't make tenure position yet because she is still studying for PhD at uni ABC. She also does not have speculator research, high research index, or enormous funding from the NIH/NSF/DoD or whatever government agency. Usually all these things are looked at whenever the dean selects a professor to be on the tenure track. Also, masters and PhD candidates can be adjuncts and supplement their own tuition by teaching intro-undergrad classes. Or they can be TAs at intro to upper level classes. This is normal.

Over the years, Professor Aly has shown her true colors of being a sham, a con, and overall nut job. While she was a PhD candidate at Uni ABC, along the way she must have left or been fired from her lab because the PI removed her from the lab's official website. \[More details below\].

Her PhD is something along the lines of computational neuroscience. It sounds fancy and hard. It is. I don't doubt or look down at some people who either fail out of a tough PhD or they leave because they are no longer interested in academia. *I don't judge. STEM PhD is hard.*

However, what is odd by me is the sheer number of unrelated classes taught by Professor Aly. I said I was fine with her teaching introduction to bio since that is a very basic class. I myself had 2 years of biology before entering college so introduction to bio was a breeze. Since she was a Computational Neuroscience PhD, she also taught a Computational Neuroscience class.

But Professor Aly was teaching other classes such as Genetics, Biostatistics, Molecular and Cell Biology, Advanced Molecular and Cell Biology, and Nutrition. None of those classes seem related to her field of study, and in class she demonstrated that she had no level of mastery. She would make a lot of mistakes. She would also teach outdated information especially in the field of Molecular and Cell Biology. Even in the advanced fields which were approaching graduate level work and recent research papers, Professor Aly showed that she did not have the slightest clue what was going on in the field, in research, or what the paper was about.

**She would even read a retracted paper and not know what retracted was, and that the information was garbage**.

Her teaching style was poorly executed too. She often spoke too fast. Even when students tried to ask her to slow down, she refused. She wanted to get out of class 30 minutes early every day because it was clear she did not know the material enough to teach. Eventually she stopped trying to read and summarize research papers for us. **She moved onto reading the Huffington post, and other popsci content**. She approached psuedoscience territory by promoting vitamins as cures for cancer and diabetes.

Only in 2 classes did she grade the material. As the University policy dictated that most midterms and finals needed to be short answers and long answers to prove knowledge: *having exams be written left the door open to subjectivity and interpretation.*

If exams were all multiple choice, then it's either right or wrong. Either you selected the correct bubble or not. This also leaves the students grade to chance or luck as random circles can determine your fate.

Anyway Professor Aly abused that written exam policy to her advantage. If she didn't like a student, she would give students straight C's and B-'s, which are straight killers especially for Biology majors who are Pre-meds and want a 3.8 GPA (or A- in all of undergrad classes) to apply to medical school).

If you tried to politely ask why you got a bad grade, **she would say the answer is wrong. When you show her Google or the textbook, she would say your answer wasn't detailed enough**.

***\^That is how she abused the written exam policy.***

But students that she did like: their exams could be filled with garbage or the wrong answers and they would still get full credit. Students have pushed pseudoscience and homeopathy on genetics exams and still got credit. Or students wrote completely wrong information, as debunked by Google and fact checked by established and qualified biology PhD professors.

Professor Aly only graded 2 classes herself. The other classes, she allowed an undergrad TA grade everything. Since the TA was an undergraduate student, and the same age as the rest of the class, you can already see the shear favoritism and corruption in this grading. Also many of the TAs were not qualified to grade. Yes MANY TAs. I have had *TAs who were finance engineers* who took only 2 biology classes and they were grading exams. There is also the potential FERPA violations of letting your peers see your entire exam and homework and university login credentials.

One TA even accidentally leaked everyone's grades on Snapchat. This actually happened.

Behind the backdoors of the TAs, they talked about how much they hated Professor Aly because they got abused, she blackmailed them, **she made them do stupid things like count ketchup packets in the cafeteria and write a report about it.**

She and another biology professor were eventually caught because they stole money and used that money to pay their TAs in University XYZ. Yes, she stole money from this uni to pay for her TAs in another uni.

Many wanted to report Professor Aly but they knew they couldn't because they would jeopardize themselves. In addition to teaching core classes required to graduate, and thus your fate was sealed by her discretion,

Professor Aly was also an advisor and a pre-health committee member. So in order to get a biology degree, you needed to kiss her ass for 4 years straight. If you wanted to go to medical or dental school, you need a health committee member's letter. She has denied this letter to at least 10 students who all left crying and confused as they were ineligible to apply. Some had decent GPA of 3.5 \[not super competitive, but semi-competitive\] yet she still would not let them apply. She forced students to take SMPs or Post-bacs or masters.

Why was she even on the health committee when she had no relevant experience or degrees to prove herself? She never been to medical school nor had a MD, PhD, or DO.

So now imagine having 6 Cs on your transcript and being in lecture with a complete nutjob who didn't even teach real science and who wasn't a PhD scientist herself.

Eventually a lot of the alumni with nothing left to lose, reported her. But they didn't report her to Director of the program. The director of the program would never have done anything as he was complicit in the money embezzlement to some extent.

I have seen so many tears and even possible suicide attempts in this program and many attribute it to Professor Aly and the way she treated people. At least 4 of my friends expressed concerns for their own mental health over Professor Aly.

Before taking Professor Aly's classes, I had a 3.8 GPA. When I was in the rollercoaster, it went to a 2.8 GPA. Before I blame anyone, I asked myself so many questions and how to improve myself. Also transferring out of the program would have hard and impose a financial burden that would set me back $100,000.

It never mattered to me how hard I studied or how long. Professor Aly told me she never liked me because she and I disagreed on politics. That's very unprofessional and that does not give her the right to mess up my grades and future. Again, I even had to fact checked by exams by Google and by other biology professors at other universities.

What is weird is that as a 20 year old, I had more research experience and papers than her. I had 1 research paper and she had 0. She also spent 7 years in a PhD and still managed to come out with 0 papers. No wonder she was fired.

Since the director was not going to do anything, there was perfect timing when the university appointed a new incoming department chair. This department chair was going to replace the old department chair who was too involved in research and not in the dramas. Once the alumni started to report her to the new department chair, soon the current students from freshman to seniors reported her. Eventually she was fired and everyone had a celebration with cake in the lounge and so much profanity was used to describe her. By then, I was a senior and about to graduate.

My undergrad GPA is still tanked from all the bad grades she gave me. I still have video and audio lecture recordings of her pseudoscience. I still have copies of her poorly graded exams. I submitted them all to the university to thoroughly investigate.",college,Need some perspective on this: One professor who ruined many students' lives and careers,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/g3sngn/need_some_perspective_on_this_one_professor_who/,1587253512.0

322,Known_Argument,1587083835,/r/college/comments/g2rhzx/really_stressed_and_torn_at_the_moment/,"   Whats up fellow college students. Im about to write something that might turn out to be really long so bear with me here. I'll try to keep it concise. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the background info. So i'm wrapping up my first year of college at Nova Southeastern, a smaller school in South Florida. I'm in this program called Dual Admissions D.O, which is basically something that ""reserves"" you a spot in osteopathic medical school so long as you meet their gpa and mcat requirements. Nova's a private school, so even with about 25k per year in scholarships (including Bright Futures 100% scholarship) I still pay roughly 10-12k per semester. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's the issue. I don't want to be a doctor, and I was pushed into this by my family. A common occurrence I know. However, the thing is my family knows about my disdain for medical professions. I'm a finance major and I have my real estate license. They're cool with all that, they just want me to get my medical degree for ""safety"" and then they say I can do whatever I want. Their reasoning is that if anything goes wrong in finance or real estate I won't lose everything because doctors always make a ton of money no matter what's happening in the economy, and if all else fails i can start a clinic or work at a hospital or something. The thing is, they're not necessarily wrong and I get that. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I took chem, my first required science class, in my first semester. And i was doing so badly I withdrew. The Dual Admit program requires an average science gpa of 3.5 or higher. If you don't do that you get academic probation and if by the end of the next semester you still don't have a 3.5 you get booted from the program. I'm currently taking chem and although i started off doing better, I did awful on my last test and i've fallen off track. I need an a minus (85%) to avoid academic probation. I've fallen to a 72%. I need to do well on the final to get anywhere near the 85, and it's not looking great. The coronavirus distraction didn't help at all. My dad at the moment is happy and proud of me, but he has no idea what's really going on. If i end up on academic probation i'll be in deep trouble. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently doing well in all my other classes, and I'd have a high gpa without chem. However I don't really care much about school, even the accounting and econ classes. I just do what I need to do to get the A without really trying to pay attention to the lectures. I spend all day watching videos and reading books about the real estate market, the stock market, and personal finance. I also attend all the virtual classes that my real estate company does. It's not that I don't like to learn. But something about being in class just makes me want to be anywhere else. I can't sit still. I still want to get my bachelors and i have NO plans to dropout whatsoever, but I don't want to get a finance degree from an expensive school like Nova when I couldve studied at UCF, stayed in my home city, and pursued a real estate career which I feel has at least some potential.

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is, I have so many things on my mind at once that sometimes my brain can't decide what to do, shuts down, and i just end up doing nothing. I'm currently trying to work on my real estate business in the middle of a pandemic. I've got work in my accounting and econ classes that is really important to complete to keep my grades good, and then there's all this chem work and studying that needs to get done if i want to stay afloat. I have no idea what to focus on, everythings just in my face all at once. If the distraction of D.O. was gone, it would be a massive weight off my shoulders.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, what I would do if i could is transfer to UCF, in my hometown of Orlando. I could do my finance degree, won't have to worry about science classes that I have no drive to complete, and I could focus on building my future in real estate at the same time. Also bright futures would mean that I would pay nothing. In my senior year of high school UCF also offered me their most prestigious scholarship ON TOP of bright futures, since I was in the top ten percent of my high school class. I would be paying nothing for school, be close to home, and be able to focus on the projects that matter to ME. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really certain that doing that would make things so much easier for me. But my dad would be so angry at me for leaving the ""blessing"" of this ""guaranteed"" medical program, and he's already put thousands of dollars into this school. I would feel completely ungrateful and wasteful if i left. But that's a sunk cost fallacy, and I'm honestly not confident in my drive to complete chem 2, organic chem, physics, biochem, and then do ANOTHER 4 years of med school. But i just cringe so hard when i think of what might happen if i leave the ""safety"" of a medical degree to pursue real estate and finance. If things don't go as my mind envisions, I could end up struggling in life and my family could say ""I told you so"".

324,Niiimo_,1586746650,/r/college/comments/g0ah7m/college_classes_keep_adding_and_removing/,"Sorry if the title is vague. I jussst had my 3rd panic attack this week due to online classes. We had two major assignments this year, one being a presentation and another being somewhat of a showcase of our work. Now for the presentation we have to do it with our group over Zoom (fun) with a professor present. The projects we have to present have a due date that has not been extended at all even though we had almost 3 weeks off for Spring Break and didn't know at all what was going to come out of it. Our hard due date is so that they can print out all of our projects for that presentation-- they told us we will have to pay upwards of $300 dollars as a group if we don't hand it in at the right time (that's how much the paper and bounding for essentially what's a manual for our projects will cost, and it's courtesy of school budget unless we hand it in late).  


Today they posted a rubric and updated requirements sheet for this so-called showcase AFTER changing it multiple times. It went from having to do a 20m video, to multiple snippets, to a pdf portfolio with video, to a pdf portfolio with video being optional, to voiceovers of work displayed, and now they want us to do the video idea again. They are judging us on appearance (y'know, since we havent been able to get our hair cuts in a month) and video quality (again, y'know, because most of us only have an iphone since this isn't a videography class).   


We've had 2 zoom classes in the last 3-4 weeks, and the last one last thursday they said a pdf portfolio was all we needed for this showcase. Now that's axed. Within this degree we have 4 different classes going on and each project has 3-4 different due dates depending on where you look (because they dont update them in all places so you never know what's right) and professors never give the same answer (there are 3 of them teaching all the same classes) to questions, so some people think x while other people think y.

College freshman here. First off, I wanted to say that I know not everyone even has the options I was lucky to have when I applied to college. I'm also lucky that my parents are paying most of college and I don't have to take on debt. There's so much I should be grateful for- I know that- but I just can't help feeling frustrated.

I turned down a full-ride scholars program at a Texas school that was a big deal to get (remarkable attention, resources, funding for pretty much everything I wanted to do, and a living stipend so large they were practically paying me to go there). The finalist weekend, however, I got a vibe I really didn't like- a lot of the finalists seemed arrogant, the whole weekend was really stressful, and Texas was dull. So I turned it down for Berkeley w/ regents but no financial aid (in-state of course). My parents told me they'd saved precisely for me to go to a UC and they'd have no problem paying, and my parents really wanted me to go to Cal too- they pushed me to take it and I remember my mom was actually disappointed when I got the full ride. I wanted to make her proud too.

I've been regretting my decision so much lately. I feel so guilty about the money that I took a job &amp; have been really frugal all the time. I got a ""scholarship"" at Berkeley, but it basically is just a fancy title. Berkeley is huge &amp; impersonal with incredibly large class sizes, and the name doesn't seem to matter much either in terms of job prospects- though there's a lot to like about the school and I'm grateful to be here, I just feel this overwhelming sense of regret for making my parents pay and turning down such a great opportunity. Some people turn down full-rides to go to ivys or LACs with a lot more attention- but I actually turned down $30k a year's worth of money for a school with arguably less resources per student, smaller classes, less professional development, etc.

I've talked about this with my parents and they say not to worry about it and that they wanted me to go to Berkeley- but I can't get rid of this guilt. All I can think of is how much $130,000 can do- a down-payment on a house, a couple years worth of pay. I've always dreamed of travelling the world and that money could literally pay for 10 vacations. It's eating me up and I can't stop thinking about it.",college,How to get over the guilt of turning down a full ride to college?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/fza0ix/how_to_get_over_the_guilt_of_turning_down_a_full/,1586642953.0

327,antant26,1585293263,/r/college/comments/fpsle8/families_pressuring_kids_into_certain_majors_and/,"I'm just a sophomore going to a state school who is observing some trends, feel free to share your perspectives and ideas. 

I see a lot of kids being forced by their parents into fields they're not passionate and it concerns me. I absolutely love my major, the career prospects, and feel very lucky that I am driven with a passion for doing what I love. I don't know if it's just my school with a high acceptance rate, but I've been seeing a trend. 

It breaks my heart how many people in my classes are being forced into nursing by their parents. They  aren't given a license and opportunity to explore what they enjoy. They're expected to just attend classes and never question their parent's judgement. Or, they're forcing to double major and deal with a ridiculous amount of stress. My friend is trying to double major in music (demanding major with ten classes) and balance his parents' desire for him to go into speech pathology, and it's a lot for him to handle. 

I had to counsel a friend in my psychology class about his parents wanting him to go into nursing. His real passion was computer science or business, and I had to tell him that at the end of the day, his parents are just people with a certain opinion about what career he should go into. If he did become a nurse to please them but never followed his true passion, that wouldn't have been good for anyone. I dunno about you guys but I can't serve people well when I'm not happy. I can't be there, be present, if I don't love what I'm doing.

I realize not everyone has the ability to pursue a career they're passionate about. Sometimes familial financial stressors are real and a healthcare profession can help a lot. For a lot of people, college is a number's game to get a better life, and I wholly respect that. I'm just saying that parents don't have to be the end-all be all in deciding where a child's life will go. There's other fields and disciplines, and allowing exploration is healthy, even beneficial. Everything will go smoother if the student is studying something they actually enjoy. 

Forcing a child to pursue a career in one discipline while ignoring the profitability of others is my main concern. Especially when forcing someone into a healthcare field, this can have real consequences. Those who pursued a college education to please their parents who find themselves stuck in a career serving others that they do not enjoy does not serve anyone well. 

I also see an alarming number of students go straight into college without doing any market research. Lots of kids have ideas of going to grad school, but there are other ways to get into fields like physical therapy that are a lot more immediate and therefore provide more experience faster. Having all the information you can about a field you're going into is important, having a realistic view before commuting tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars into something that might not be a true passion is important.  

I feel like associate's degrees are underrated. I know loads of kinesiology majors wanting to go into physical therapy, and while getting a bachelor's degree can be great, getting an associate's could make more sense. I've seen physical therapy assistant salaries are pretty great, you get your hands into the field sooner, better return on investment, and if PT does end up not being the right choice, they can always get a bachelor's degree. I've seen loads of openings for this kind of position, there is market demand, and it doesn't make sense to me to major in something you've never really tried out in the real world. 

I read somewhere that the average amount of times people change their careers throughout their lifespan is five to seven times. That's a lot of career changes. Doing market research is also important to make sure that what you're majoring in will pay off. Loads of popular majors like Biology, English, Social sciences, and others have a pretty high percentage of people that regret their major decision. While there are some advantages to these fields and there's nothing wrong with absolutely loving them, having a realistic idea of what life will be like after graduation is important.

Throughout several ""draw my life"" videos I've watched, the darkest time people mention is usually when they graduate college and face the real world. In my local area there is actually a support group for such people on how much reality can bite. It's hard when you had a great time studying anthropology, but can only get a job as a dental receptionist. My friend actually had to move to another state for better cost of living.

Going to grad school doesn't have to be right after college. My mom got her master's degree in her fifties, and her world experience gave her advantages as an applicant. I feel like lots of people say they want to pursue a PhD, and that's great. However, there are some issues with oversaturated fields and limited tenured job opportunities. Things are different in today's world than they were for our professors. 

I see lots of psychology majors who intend to go to graduate school, and that's great. We always need more healthcare professionals. However, a psychology degree on its own has limited applications (my mom said the only job you could get is being a caseworker). Grad school is hard to get into, and I feel like we should be more honest about that. Having career field experience can be extremely valuable, and it should not be undermined. Doing market research is important, and it's not worth going thousands of dollars into debt to pursue a major you don't love or one that doesn't give you the standard of living you desire.

Tl;dr Parents forcing children into certain fields completely ignoring the profitability of other options (associate's degrees) and throwing children into getting into debt without doing proper market research on market demand, profitability, job satisfaction, degree flexibility, or examining how things things in the past do not apply or are different today.",college,Families pressuring kids into certain majors and not doing market research,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/fpsle8/families_pressuring_kids_into_certain_majors_and/,1585311263.0

I can't move there permanently because living on my own would be too expensive, but I can do a few months.

But, I still need to make this decision soon and I can't decide what to go for. Northeastern would be almost 50k less over four years than Georgia Tech with my scholarship, and in this economy, I feel like I can't ignore the opportunity to have less debt to pay, less things to worry about. My parents are willing to pay but I'm not sure if they can pay all of Georgia Tech or even Northeastern; I'm guaranteeing some debt with either decision. I am planning on majoring in neuroscience and from there either 1) get a masters and go into artificial intelligence and machine learning OR 2) med school to be a psychiatrist or neurologist OR 3) get a phd in neuro. Georgia Tech would be awesome for artificial intelligence, but really expensive if I decide I wanna go to med school. But, Northeastern also has really good computer science and neuroscience classes. I also feel like the student atmospheres of both schools are pretty different since NEU is a northeast private school with lots of international students while GT is a southern state school with a bunch of engineers. Does anyone know what the atmosphere is like at both of these schools? I'm pretty open-minded, love having interesting people to party with, but I genuinely care about learning.

Here I am 2 years later. I dropped out of graduate school about this time last year pursuing an information sciences degree after one semester. I decided to take some time off to decide on what I want to do. I thought maybe I'd like doing school librarianship? Nope. Now I have the urge to drop out again after one semester because I don't like the idea of teaching as much as I thought. 

I am wasting my money and my time due to my indecisiveness. I think I'm only dedicated to the idea of earning more money with a master's. I feel obligated into going into a field that relates to my undergrad too. 

I've been trying to do some soul searching and I honestly don't know why I went to college in the first place? I can't use my degrees in my small town.

I've done 2 semesters already (1 at a different college), on my 3rd right now. I have no problem learning how to program. I actually really enjoy it and think it helps me overall mentally. Just a few thoughts on what's currently going through my head regarding Comp. Sci.:  
  
* I really dislike the software this current school uses for making programs (It's Cengage and its compiler.. yuck), most of the time it causes so much more stress than it needs to. To the point where I'm sat at my computer for 3+ hours not eating wondering why the program isn't working properly. I am learning C++ and its foundations, so that's not a concern. And in fact, the classroom setting/schedule helps keep me on track.   
   
* I really like the future outlook and security of having a degree in regards to a career. Admittedly, the pay is also a factor.   
  
* I also understand you don't necessarily need a degree in Comp. Sci. to land a job. That's something going through my mind. I could just learn it all on my own.   
  
Regarding Geography,  
  
* I enjoy the classes I've taken so far a lot. I rarely need to stress out over them and generally find it a breeze. Geography is also something I'm pretty passionate about.   
  
* There's a degree of uncertainty in the job market I can't shake. Future growth doesn't look great. Pay is.. comfortable but not 6 figures like a software job might be, aside from going into a technical GIS position. That position and Urban Planning are the 2 I think might interest me the most.

High school junior in NY here, not sure if this is the right sub to post this question, but I was wondering if anyone knew of any scholarship program that'd be able to pay for this program. 

I wanna go into an architectural major in college and I need a portfolio to do that. I only recently found out about the portfolio part and was planning on using the summer to make one. 

Anyway, Cooper Union, my number one choice right now, offers a summer program for high school students that helps them make art portfolios. [Here's ] the website for more information. I really want to attend the program, only problem is is that it's $4,000 with no financial aid.

I've asked my school if they could pay for it, and I've researched different programs and scholarships but can't seem to find any that would fit. I emailed Questbridge if they'd be able to pay for it, but since it's not one of their college partners, they said no.

334,Michaelneedssleep,1583206605,/r/college/comments/fcokac/grandfather_offered_to_pay_for_my_college/,"Okay, *so. Here we go.*

I'm 23 years old, unemployed and didn't finish high school. Before you scroll to the comment section to scold me over that, save yourself the satisfaction, I've heard it all. 

Growing up through high school, I very slowly lost interest in my education over the caveat that I didn't believe I was *truly* learning anything. I had a rough childhood that made it difficult for me to follow suit with everyone else in finishing school. I tested high, but out of frustration with Nevada's education system alongside everyone and anyone struggling to keep up with their student debt, I decided post-secondary wasn't for me. I got a phone call from my high school on what would've been my last year of HS and they told me I wouldn't graduate this year because of my credits.

So, I did what I thought was smart. I was young, and decided I'd be better off just working. I bounced around several jobs (food &amp; bev, luxury retail, etc.) and my highest paying job was $16/hr + commission on every sale (for selling $1,000+ handbags, this was not a bad gig for me). But there was no passion or happiness there. My interests were always on music, tech, cryptocurrency, things of that sort.

Long story short, I'm currently living with my girlfriend and father. I had a life event happen that put me in this position and I can't seem to find my way back out. I acquired a MME Agent Card to work in the cannabis industry but months have passed and I still have no job. It is what it is, I'm not crying about it, but it's certainly frustrating when you have bills and so does your lady.

Out of the blue, my retired grandfather messaged me and offered to pay for my college education (on the account of him probably seeing that I was studying for my GED). I wasn't expecting this, nor did I have any set plans to go to college, but.. here I am.

The problem is, I know what it's like to have a monotonous customer service job that you try to keep simply because if you didn't have it, you wouldn't be surviving, and this is the biggest wall for me.

I'm an above average drummer, but that probably won't get me paid. I know the ins and outs of computers, have a 110 average WPM and love technology, but coding is not my forte considering I hate learning new languages. And if something pays well, I usually can't see myself working a job like that happily for the rest of my life.

I'm not asking anyone here to tell me what to do for the rest of my life. I'm here because I've neglected to consider post-secondary education on account of me not wanting to be in debt for the rest of my life with a degree that isn't getting me a job in the US, and now it's biting me in the ass for not being prepared for something generous like this.

Do I pursue a passion that may not pay well? Or go for something lucrative, and just ride it out until I become financially happy? I don't know. All advice is welcomed.",college,"Grandfather offered to pay for my college education, what now?",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/fcokac/grandfather_offered_to_pay_for_my_college/,1583224605.0
335,ImTara55,1583030246,/r/college/comments/fbnkfk/if_you_could_do_it_over_again/,"I'm 26, have a Bachelor's in General Studies (Spanish concentration, psychology minor), and some graduate-level coursework under my belt. I currently work in community mental health. I absolutely love my job, but the pay is very low compared to other fields and I can't get a further promotion within my center (or the field, really) until I have a Master's degree.

Here's my problem: I absolutely hate grad school culture. I hate the expected overwork, I hate the academia and research worship, and I hate that I feel like I'm in elementary school again with some of the dumbest, most time-wasting assignments I've ever known. For reference, I've studied both education and counseling at the graduate level. I have no degree to show for either because I always quit after the first or second semester because I'm so fed up with the culture of grad school.

It's pretty much a given that I either need to look into getting a second Bachelor's degree so I can get a job in a higher-paying field, or I need to give up my dream of ever having a family by myself on my salary. I'm barely staying financially afloat while living with my parents, and my mom has made it clear that I need to move out when I am going to start a family someday, so I will have to add in housing, food, health insurance, and day care costs in the future, not including other things I will need to survive.

If you were going to do it all over again and get a second Bachelor's degree, or are planning to change your major for your first one, what would you do? I'm not concerned about the cost of a second Bachelor's because undergrad coursework at my local state universities is pretty cheap. My GPA is high in both undergraduate and graduate coursework, and I've done well in every subject in the past (but I really would prefer to stay away from math-heavy degrees).

Ideally, I'd love to have a starting salary in the future of $60,000 or more. I would love to not have to get a Master's for my future job in order to advance. I'm bilingual (English/Spanish). I also have a disability that makes me tired if I stand or do physical work for long periods of time (I say this because I had considered nursing, and that alone made me throw the idea out).

I plan on being at my current job for at least a few more years, but ideally, I'd be doing night or online classes during that time. If it doesn't work out, and I need to go back to school full-time or during the day, my disability does qualify me for Voc Rehab benefits (I've received them in the past).

Throw some second Bachelor's ideas at me, please! Thanks in advance.",college,If you could do it over again...,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/fbnkfk/if_you_could_do_it_over_again/,1583048246.0

337,bluejedi24,1582955205,/r/college/comments/fb85vs/anyone_else_just_completely_burned/,"College has definitely not been a thrilling experience for me and I can't wait to be done. I've taken 5+ years to get my bachelor's because of interruptions due to needing to work, life events, and changing my major. I also never really felt like I fit in at my very large school since I despise party/Greek life culture. I used to be very introverted. Eventually I found a home in my major and got comfortable with life, but even then, my friends are all from different places, different clubs, etc. It's not like childhood or high school where you're in a highly structured environment where you bond with the same people over time and don't really have to worry about too much. College has made me feel very lonely and hopeless at times. Like I'm just attending to all my responsibilities without really getting anywhere or building anything.

I've had to go into a lot of student debt to get a college degree. For the beginning few years (starting in high school actually), I worked a lot to support myself, but that also meant I fell behind by 2 semesters because I had to work many 50-60 hour weeks. The last two years of college, I decided to work only during summer breaks and just take out the needed loans to finish up my degree and graduate ASAP, since I wanted to focus fully on my studies during the semesters. So the good news is that I graduate in May with a very good academic record. The bad news though is I was essentially just kicking the can down the road financially; living off of loans knowing they're just going to be waiting for me after graduation. If I could go back in time and do things differently, I would've started at community college or joined the military instead first.

I'm just sick and tired of sitting in a lab room clicking in programs and typing code for hours and hours every day, forgoing a good diet and healthy habits. I'm sick of interacting with people for just a few minutes each day but not being able to really grow with people because we all have different schedules and live different lives. I'm sick of living in my 3-person apartment off-campus where my one roommate is a disgusting slob. I'm sick of being highly financially stressed and thinking about how I will have to pay back debt for years and years. I am absolutely sick of the college ""bubble."" I feel like I've lost a healthy mind. It has stripped a lot of feeling and emotion from me to the point where I just feel like an empty pawn in a huge simulation. I've inadvertently forgotten that life shouldn't always be about chasing specific goals, or meeting academic or professional requirements, or submitting applications, or fulfilling others' expectations; you also have to remember to invest in fun things that simply make you happy. And I mean really simple things, like spending time with a family member, or reading, or going on bike rides.

I miss playing sports and being highly active and competitive. I miss genuinely bonding and growing with people like you do in childhood. I miss traveling for pleasure (can't when you're broke). I miss being able to smile and laugh regularly and actually mean it. I miss my family. I miss feeling valued and like I belong.

My degree is a ""wider"" degree than most; it has many applications, but I've never been able to say to myself ""This is exactly what I want to do with my life."" So I currently have no definitive plans for right after graduation, and you know what? That's fine. I'm also limited by the fact that I can't afford to just move to a new place and get going without any support.

So my plan is to go back home, at least temporarily, and just take some time to really figure out what I want to do with myself. I can work whatever local job I can find and live at home with Mom temporarily while I reset myself. Figure out what I need to do with my life to make it enjoyable and meaningful again as an adult. And then start working towards whatever that vision is. I look forward to saying goodbye to college and goodbye to many of the people in it. I'll try to maintain contact with a few friends and acquaintances who I genuinely do value, but I promise you that's not many.

338,blahhhhh90,1582812892,/r/college/comments/faco8e/to_the_people_who_dont_want_to_go_to_their/,"I live in S. Korea. I moved away from my home, to another country, and took a different life path than the norm. I was previously a college drop out and i felt stuck and helpless. I spent one year in language school learning Korean, and saw the opportunity to study and get my degree at a well-known insitution (of the top 3 in the country) for MUCH cheaper tuition cost than in the USA as an opportunity. I worked my ass off, adjusted to a completely different educational system, took half my classes in my 2nd language. I visited home **twice** over the past 7 years that I have lived here. Every summer and winter vacation I could have taken extra classes to graduate sooner, but I couldn't because i needed the time to take on extra part-time work to earn my tuition and living expenses. It was hard but I survived it. I experienced a serious sexual assault case on the eve of my birthday by a complete stranger as I was going home from work, spent half the day in the police station and the other half packing my stuff because my male flatmate and so-called friend decided that being raped meant i was no longer a trustworthy housemate. I spent time homeless. I endured abuse and manipulation from messed up relationships with narcissists and fuckboys. 

I failed my first semester because i got pneumonia during finals while trying to work a bartending job 5 days a week. A year later I almost died of a heart infection triggered by what later came to be found as a diagnosis for an autoimmune disorder. I joined my school's women's soccer team, which i liked and found a way to make some new friends and have some sense of a social life and be able to do something that felt part of my identity. I got into health and fitness and started taking better care of my body, stopped working unhealthy jobs where i was badly mistreated as a foreigner and as a female, even if the pay was less. Then I tore my ACL and had to have surgery, and was out of sport and the gym for several months. I dove into my studies and said ""fuck you"" to everyone around me, I cut out my social life (which was already not much to begin with) but I blasted through my courses and kept my GPA up and my bills paid. Eventually I got into a routine and was able to start being social again and I met some of the best friends I thought I could have, and my current boyfriend who i've been together with for over a year. He's as asshole sometimes and nobody is perfect but he definitely loves and respects me. I got closer to God, and found new peace in faith. It took me 11 semesters (5.5 years) but i finally finished all my credits and I was set up to graduate this week. (our academic year starts in March) I finished a dual degree and a minor. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then because of the coronavirus and increasing tensions regarding the situation, our school cancelled the graduation ceremony. Then they cancelled the opportunity to rent the gowns and at least take pictures on campus. 

I went in today to pick up my diploma. The lady in the office just handed me two pieces of card stock and gestured to a table for the hard cover book and told me i can take one to put my certificates inside. Then I went outside, and for some reason, people were all over campus with their friends and families, dressed up nice, taking pictures, wearing the gowns, getting flowers, happy and excited. Despite all the chaos and stress with this virus situation. Yet there I was, not even showered, with bloody gauze in my mouth (i had dental surgery earlier that morning), alone, with this stupid book in my hands. I felt angry and bitter. My family can't fly out here to celebrate with me. None of my friends remembered, and I couldn't invite them out for photos and stuff since the event was supposed to be cancelled. With the virus, and people usually busy with their lives and other things on the weekends, I didn't bother to plan a graduation party because I already knew that half of the people I really wanted to be there wouldn't come. My boyfriend didn't even call or text me today to congratulate me. Instead, I have endured waiting for him to tell me about how much stress and pressure he has been under because his parents are splitting - i know about it, but not the details, but after over a year he still hasn't said a word to me about it. So whatever happened today put him in a bad mood and all he could say to me today was ""leave me alone."" Wow, babe, thanks. I couldn't even get a ""Congratulations babe, i'm so proud of you, listen i'm sorry things are not good for me right now, but i love you and let's celebrate later. "" I know that if I hadn't posted a picture of my diploma on social media not a single person would have remembered to say anything to me, and even then, i get a bunch of comments on IG and Facebook but no personal messages, no phone calls. Nothing. Because of time zone differences I can't even call my family and talk to them. 

I paid for this out of my pocket. I uprooted my life, and suffered through so much, I'm about to be 30 this year and I'm finally a college graduate. Yet this most important milestone, that's supposed to be a most important day full of happiness and celebration, I spent the entire day alone in my apartment crying all day long without anyone giving a single shit, eating soggy spaghetti because of stupid stitches in my mouth. With all of that, it's impossible to feel happy for myself. Spending so many years in chronic anxiety and stress just pushing and pushing all for this day, and nothing comes. Yes I'm grateful for the opportunity to even go to school and graduate at all, i'm grateful that i'm not sick with coronavirus and i'm healthy and i have my home to live in. I'm grateful for the people who did support me and stuck around when i went through dark times, and made the less-dark times more light and enjoyable memories. But TODAY, no one was there for me. Nobody. And i didn't even have a cheesy boring ceremony to at least make it somewhat special and give me the acknowledgment I fucking earned for my achievement.

So all of you people who don't want to go to your commencement, who think graduation is stupid and a waste of time, *fuck you*. You should appreciate the opportunity you have to have such a thing. Even if your parents or family isn't supportive, even if your GPA wasn't that great, you have your friends and classmates and the atmosphere. you have photos to look back on as proof and reminders of that amazing thing you achieved. You at least have the choice.",college,"To the people who don't want to go to their graduation and think it's stupid, I hate you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/faco8e/to_the_people_who_dont_want_to_go_to_their/,1582830892.0

I somehow didn't inherit their intelligence but I went to a competitive high school and was able to pull off a decent ACT score and get into BU (after my parents proofread everything on my common app). But now here I am, a sophomore STEM major, and I don't really think I can handle it. My GPA is just hovering right around a 3.0 and I don't want to give up on my classes. But I keep getting Ds in classes everyone says are the easier ones and I just feel like I really can't do it. Some people have to be weeded out. The issue is that if I tried to switch now there's no way I'd be able to graduate in two years like I planned and I can't afford to go here longer than I have to. I'm not a hard worker but my major is decently interesting and there's no other major I'd rather do here anyway. I've also lived in the Boston area for my entire life and most of my friends and family live here or pretty nearby, but none of my family is from here and I deeply feel like an outsider. I'm dying to move somewhere else, but I have no idea how I'd afford it or where I'd go because I have no idea what career I want or could get after college (I'm not premed). I barely know anyone who lives in other cities so I'm terrified of being lonely and I have no experience with moving, but I just feel like I'm deeply not a New Englander. Honestly I don't really have much faith in getting a job after college. BU seems to be decently hard to get a good GPA, but still. I feel like it's hard to compete with people who have a better GPA. Also, my younger sister has dyslexia and my family might move so we can afford for her to go to private school. I know I'm so immature and selfish to be sad about this and this is what she needs, but secretly I've been fearing it so much since I've lived in the same town for almost my whole life and a lot of my best friends are still from my high school and it'd be hard to see them much again (I go home for breaks). I'm also in my first relationship and my boyfriend is way more into it than me which really freaks me out, but I can't bring myself to end it even if honestly some of the reason I'm still dating him is just to finally have a boyfriend and not be my stupid self people have looked down on my whole life (I do like him in the ways I should to some extent, which complicates things further). I'm worried long term I'll never be able to commit to someone and legitimately want to spend all my time with them more than anyone else since I like hanging out with a group of friends the most, but at the same time I want to get married and not be alone my whole life. I'm doing way too much stuff- balancing schoolwork with three clubs (no leadership), exercise, a volunteer position, an on campus job I can choose my hours for, trying to apply for summer internships I likely won't get, my relationship, seeing a bunch of friends that aren't all friends with each other, and still seeing my family semi-regularly/helping with my ten year old sister since I'm not very far from home. And I have terrible time management skills so I waste half the day away when it's incredibly important. I know I need to quit something, but there's nothing I can really quit. Here it is, almost 2 AM, I'm trying to make up the hours I said I did for my job last week, I flaked on my boyfriend today, and I have an 8AM chem lab tomorrow I haven't done the prelab for or last week's postlab. I just failed my orgo exam I crammed for and I'll have to lie to all my smart friends in the class as usual so they don't know how stupid I really am. I don't even know what I'll tell my parents. The worst part is that I know these are all such first world problems and I was given so much opportunity that I don't deserve when a lot of people don't get to go to college (I sound like such a shitty person in this but I really do care about other people and I see myself as worse than the average person), and I'm going to throw this expensive tuition away my parents are killing themselves to pay for away and never get a job and live with them until they die and then who even knows. I might seem like I have low self esteem, but I think I have reason to. I was born without any real talents in an area of success and I don't belong here at all. I don't know what to do. I'm sorry for going on and on and this is probably normal for a 19 year old to be unsure of their future, but I just feel like I'll be a total failure (you can probably tell by now interviews aren't going to save me). If anyone has any idea of how I could possibly turn any aspect of my life around, that would be much appreciated.

I'm a senior in high school, I would like to major in software engineering. I'm from a small town in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The school I would like to go to is University Texas at Dallas, but it's going to be expensive and I would not be able to commute. I would obviously have to take out loans. My other option is Texas A&amp;M Commerce (you might know this one from the two shootings recently :/) I have made a list of pros and cons, trying to be as unbiased as I can 


UTD

Pros:

Would move me closer to Dallas and away from the small suburbs 

The tech scene in Dallas has grown a ton these past few years, would be easier to find a job and internships

Social scene at UTD is not great, but better than TAMUC, has a lot of clubs I am really interested in 

Would get me away from my family. I love them, but my dad is a drunk (not abusive) and I can't stand the drunken rants and arguments he has. On more than one occasion I have had to pick my brothers up from school because he drank all day

Could commute from as the school is about 45-50 minutes away and save money

Do not have to live on campus freshman year, could try to find an apartment with roommates to lower cost of rent

Cons: 

If I commuted and had class mon-fri I would spend about 7.5 hours in the car each week.  Commuting would also make extracurriculars I want to be apart of hard to participate in as a few of them have meetings that go until around 10 pm

UTD is sorta infamous for how bad the food on the dining hall is

Tuition is about 15k a semester

Rent would cost about 10-11k a year

TAMUC

Pros:

Can live at home and save a ton of money 

Tuition costs about half as much

Almost everyone from my school is going there so I would at least know some people

Would eat at home, parents would pay for most food

Cons:

Social scene is basically non-existent

Almost everyone from my school is going there so I would at least know some people 

Not a great computer science program 

Does not offer software engineering

341,joiemoie,1582446226,/r/college/comments/f86t46/why_you_probably_shouldnt_double_major_discussion/," [Why You (Probably) Shouldn't Double Major](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSUZwLtFYWE)

&amp;#x200B;

I know this will be a controversial topic, so all respectful and free discussion is welcome. These are my opinions as a college graduate myself. I am also biased because I didn't double major although I considered it. I'd appreciate hearing counterarguments from those who double majored and enjoyed it.

Note: This refers to double majors where the extra major MANY extra classes. I am not referring to combined majors that actually take about the same time as one degree.  

The decision to double major can seem tempting. It lets people pick 2 loves for studies when they can't pick one. Some people are overachievers and just want to double major for the thrill and challenge. Some people want to double major because they believe it will raise their income and make them more well rounded. 

When I first entered college, I knew that I wanted to do engineering. I loved math and science, and it was the right fit for me. However, coming into college, I also enjoyed the humanities. I felt like I just wanted to be able to take on the challenge and be able to say that I was able to beat it. Because of this competitive mindset, I considered pursuing a double major when I entered college. In fact, I even thought to myself, I have enough credits. Why not pursue a triple major!  

**The first reason that you shouldn’t double major is because of cost.** Pursuing a double major basically means going after two degrees. Depending on the level of overlap, you could be looking at an additional 1 or even 2 years just to be able to finish both degrees. The cost of pursuing that second degree can basically be computed as the cost of tuition plus the time opportunity cost of having to stay in school longer and not being able to make money from a real job. If the cost of tuition is 30k per year, and you could have made 70k from a job with a single degree, then you basically lost out on 100k for one single year, and 200k for being in school for 2 years.  According to a study by PBS, double majors barely add any extra income. If you look at STEM majors who take an extra degree in the humanities, they earn **on average an extra 3.6% more income** compared to their STEM only counterparts. That’s basically nothing. When I thought about triple majoring, and finishing in 4.5 years, I realized I could just as easily do a single major, finish in only 2 years, and not have to deal with 4.5 years of stress and pain. Basically, that decision saved me 100k in tuition ALONE. This doesn’t include the savings because I was able to start working earlier, as well as the cost of food and housing when you are at school. 

So let’s answer the next question of whether a double major is truly enjoyable. The short and simple answer is no. **People who choose the route of double majoring usually really regret their decision because the courseload is too much if they really want to be able to graduate on time.** One of my friends who is double majoring rarely has any free time and literally spends all of her time just on her coursework. The only reason that she sticks with it is because she’s an international student, so staying in school longer buys her more time to find a job while she is still in school. My other friend picked a double major as well. After she realized it would take her 6 years to graduate instead of 4, she decided that she will cancel the double major. However, it’s not an easy decision. **Once you are already deep in the rabbit hole of pursuing your double major, it feels like a sunk cost to quit now. That’s why many people, even after deciding a double major isn’t for them, stick it through to the end.**  

**The real value of a single major comes from the fact that you can have laser focus. Having a major that you really like, focusing all your time and attention to it, and getting the best value out of that one degree.**  

**The first alternative is one major and one minor.** Usually a minor is just a few classes and very easy to complete. It doesn’t add much time to your degree, and you usually decide on what minor you want later.  

**The second alternative that I think is acceptable is one major and one master’s degree.** Truth is that you can literally do a master’s in anything irrespective of your undergrad. My coworker at Amazon literally did Animal Studies for her Bachelor’s. Then, she did a 2 year Master’s degree in computer science. Now, after less than a year of working, she got an offer from Amazon and is making that big money. Also, you aren’t committing yourself to hell at the age of 18 right out of high school. Instead, you are opting to pursue the master’s degree in your junior or senior year of college, ideally after you’ve focused your career path and known exactly what you want to be studying.  So overall, save your money guys! Don’t take the double major! If they are unrelated majors, you will basically be wasting it anyways, and if they are related, you could just as easily do the master’s degree and finish in just the same amount of time with even a more valuable degree!

342,JadeGreenleaves,1581817026,/r/college/comments/f4jfc1/im_running_out_of_money_for_college_what_should/,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit, so I apologize for any mistakes. Also, this is going to be a long post, so bear with me!

Here's my situation:

I'm a 20 y/o college student on my 4th semester. I currently live on campus with my twin sister. Our parents make too much money for FAFSA to offer us any aid besides small loans but they cannot afford to put any money towards our education. This mean we're paying out of pocket for the entirety of our expenses. 

We lived at home our first semester and worked almost full time while taking a full course load. I'm working toward my BFA, which requires a huge amount of studio time outside of class. By the time I would get out of class and home for the night, I'd have no time to work on my projects before I had to be awake at 3:30am for work, then school the next day. This situation was greatly reducing my academic performance and extremely stressful. Work was very understaffed so I got a ton of hours. Despite the stress, I was able to make and save a lot of money.

Since then, we've been sharing a room on campus in the cheapest available housing. We come home on the weekends to work, so we have a fraction of the hours. Living on campus has been an absolute necessity for me as I need access to programs, materials, and studio space that I only have on campus. I spend around 27 hours a week (9 per studio class, I'm taking 3) outside of class, which is standard for art courses. 

This setup has been great for my schoolwork, but horrible on my finances. This year has been full of unexpected expenses. For example, I suddenly lost a $1000/sem scholarship due to taking under 15 credit hours this semester. This was something I wasn't warned about and hadn't been enforced or mentioned until this semester.

The nature of my degree is extremely expensive as well. I've spent almost 2k in supplies and framing this year alone. I would have been able to manage this if it hadn't been for the loss of my scholarship. 
I will also need a car in the near future. I share one with my twin right now, which makes having a separate job/life complicated.

My current job is my first out of high school. I've been a great employee, and my boss has worked around my school schedule. However, I only make $8.75/hr which isn't sufficient to pay my expenses. A substantial raise is highly unlikely as the business is small and family owned (not my family). We are no longer understaffed, which means will have reduced hours this summer, which I cannot afford.

I need a higher paying job, but I don't know of one that will work around my schedule once summer ends.

I don't know what to do from here. I'll barely be able to pay for this semester, but I have no idea what to do in the fall. 

I've worked extremely hard to get this far and I don't want to give up. I'm passionate about my major and I've kept a 4.0 gpa despite everything. I'm worried taking a semester off will set me back and may sever my connections. 

I'm frustrated to be in this situation. I worked hard through high school to get good grades and a good ACT score, I've kept a perfect GPA through college, I have a job and go to the cheapest school in the state. Despite everything I still can't afford school. I'm not giving up, but it's crucial I make the best decisions I can moving forward. 

Does anyone have any advice? I'm open to any options you guys can think of. I've been avoiding taking out a private loan because I'm trying to graduate with as little debt as possible. At this point, it may be worth it.

343,not_its_father,1581272076,/r/college/comments/f1ciq8/rant_about_college/,"Why am I paying the professors salary just for them to force me to buy a fucking access code shit software that auto grades and makes content for them? Professors don't do anything anymore.

I have a professor that does not teach jack shit. ~160 kids in this class, there's only 2 TAs and 1 prof. The purpose of this class is to do all the work on your own outside of class, then show up for questions. How the fuck am I supposed to ask questions if there's 159 other kids raising their hands asking questions? I swear to fuck I spend the entire class with my hand raised waiting for a TA to show up. I send emails and they don't get answered. The best resource is other students. 

I have another prof, she is the ONLY professor who teaches a specific class which is required for my degree. There is no other option. I had an online (auto graded) assignment marked wrong, I sent her proof that I was right, and I didn't get a reply. I come into class *6 fucking days later* and confront her, and I asked ""did you receive my email or did I send it to the wrong person?"" and she says she got it but didn't read it. Well okay, a day or two or 3 is understandable. A fucking *week* later and still no reply (and no reply to this day, 10 days later) is fucking absurd. My grade still hasn't changed.

I had another professor 2 semesters ago (spring 2019), and once again, I got an answer marked wrong that was correct. Emailed this lady and she replied standing by her typo and told me tough shit, you still got it wrong. This is for a programming quiz (data structures). A typo is the difference between right at wrong. ""quizBank"" is NOT the same as ""quziBank"", those are 2 completely fucking separate variables. She ignored all further emails, which I made very polite because my grade is in this woman's hands. This lady did not do anything at all except 1 quiz a week based on zybooks. The midterm and final were proctored, not by the school, so we had to pay out of pocket to take our fucking exams. $60 I wasn't expecting to pay, which isn't too bad, but why the fuck do I have to pay for that? There's no resources on campus for proctored exams? Fucking seriously? I can say I learned absolutely nothing at all about data structures but still somehow got a B. Fuck you [removed], you're fucking lazy and absolutely useless. Google her and check out that fantastic rate my professor rating. Edit I changed my mind on putting her name.

Financial aid. I met with a financial aid bursar lady fall 2018 who was reluctantly helpful. She sighed and sounded annoyed that she found me a $500/semester grant. Great! Any little bit helps, thank you! I only got this grant for 1 year. Last year, spring 2019, I went to meet with her only to find out she doesn't meet with students anymore. Neither does anyone in financial aid. Their whole office was relocated to another building. So I go and find out *other STUDENTS* are now handling finances. Fantastic, what's better than a barely paid 19 year old handling my finances? Them bullshitting every fucking question I ask them. They don't know the fucking answers. I call them out and say it's okay to say you don't know something, but don't fucking spread misinformation, especially on something that cost me $1000 a year and other students thousands as well. Fuck you. Now that grant I had is seemingly ""lost"", I can't meet with anyone over the age of 20, and I'm genuinely fucking annoyed. Some of these kids want to be helpful, but it's like they're trained to tell you whatever answer comes off the top of their fucking head at that moment. ""hmmmm *I think* it's because -blahblahbullshitanswer-."" I've almost had to drop out on multiple occasions due to a lack of money. I got denied every federal and private loan. I applied for around 6 private loan companies. Federal is determined by the financial aid office, except parent plus which I was denied on with both my parents. My credit is great, 730, I've had an auto loan for $35k and I paid it off entirely (and my credit dropped because now my average age of credit is lower lmfao) and apparently that doesn't mean shit. My parents have $300,000 and $40,000 in student loans for my sister's private college loans, so I can't get money, my younger brother went to the military because he can't get help and had no money of his own, and now my younger sister who's still in HS doesn't believe me when I say she has to work, make money like I did, and pay your own way through college as you go. There is no money or loans that will magically appear. Just as you scrape by to pay the tuition by the due date, you're fucked in the ass with $400 in access codes and out of pocket housing / food costs. 

Back to access codes. Nearly every professor requires zybooks, Pearson mylab, wiley plus, or some other dog shit software that the students are required to pay for. Why are we paying the university and then paying a 3rd party to do our homework? These companies are determining the fucking prices. If the prof says ""we're using zybooks, this is the code"", there is *No. Other. Choice*. You are forced to pay whatever zybooks/pearson/wiley/whoever says you gotta pay. $60? $90? $120?? Pay it or fail. Textbooks are no longer as widely used because kids pirate them because they're charging $200 for a fucking textbook. What is the fucking incentive for these professors to be using this software? Zybooks is absolute shit. Complete one section, get to the next, and all the answers from last section are gone. There's no penalty for getting anything wrong. There is no learning going on here. It's only useful for information, but it even fucking sucks at that because it doesn't go in depth on anything.

Even though we are almost the same age and we're in the same graduating class, she was able to graduate 2 years early which ultimately allowed her to start college (community college) when she was around 16 or 17. She was fairly young and obviously at that age you still don't quite know what to do with your life, so she changed between majors pretty often (from teaching to financing to nursing to gen ed, back to nursing etc) and failed lots of classes due to not being college ready- which set her pace and GPA under- resulting in her student loans being confiscated.

It's frustrating for her (and me) because her education right now seems nearly impossible. She told me she only gets her financial aid back when she enrolls in enough classes to be a full time student in the fall- which can't really happen (or is difficult) because of her work hours. She was looking at universities and trying to see any nursing programs that would allow her to complete her classes in the evening, but the only program available is out of reach because she doesn't meet the requirements (GPA wise and such). 

As much as it frustrates her it is also frustrating for me as well because you hate to see someone you love go through something like this. The more I think about it, the more I conclude that there's possibly only two options for her: she either is just going to have to work a second job and just have to pay for school out of pocket (during community college), or simply she's just going to have to maybe drop out for right now and go back when the time is right. I've brought up that second one to her multiple times but every time it gets shut down. She wants to do it as soon as possible. She says that whenever she's not doing something for her education, she feels like a failure.

I know that there's probably a lot of crucial pieces of context missing, but I was just wondering if anyone would have any advice for her? Or maybe is there someone she could talk to? Maybe some sort of faculty adviser at the college, but she says that they are never any help. It's just hard going through every day seeing her soul and dreams being crushed. Any advice at all would be appreciated.

Well, that was red flag number one. Being the naive freshmen that I was, I thought it was normal for professors to be a couple days late. I also didn't sense trouble when in the first syllabus my prof put up, he had a lengthy paragraph explaining that he was still a student and was a new professor who has never instructed an online course before. 

But, then, two days later, after I'd submitted all of the assignments that I was told to do that week, my prof posted another syllabus, replacing the old one, explaining that he was building the course as we went along and he decided that instead of the assignments I'd already completed, we'd do something else, and get the grades for those assignments Monday morning. So, I got those assignments turned in too. 

Come Monday morning, there were no grades to be found, and then there was a third syllabus that replaced the other two. I read through it, and it was basically the same shit. New prof. Unfamiliar with the course. Try this for a change. Etc. 

I started to get really worried, and began having daily panic attacks because of the constant change in the course, and reached out to my parents and therapist asking if this was normal. My parents graduated college in the late 1990s/early 2000's. They didn't attend any online courses. So, they had no idea. My therapist, however, was a professor before she decided to use her psychology PhD to help people. My therapist told me that was very abnormal, and suggested that if things didn't improve, to drop the class. 

So, I got home, checked the course, noticed that there was a fourth syllabus posted, and decided I was done. I let my parents know what I was doing, and dropped out this afternoon, with a day to spare before refunds were cut off. 

I honestly feel like shit. I keep thinking if I just stuck with the class, I would've done just fine. The assignments weren't very hard. It was just the lack of consistency and my anxiety that got in the way. Everyone I've told about this has told me not to be so hard on myself, but I can't help it. I'm in therapy trying to bring my anxiety to heel, and develop a more positive and merciful attitude towards life and myself. But, at the moment, I feel just like a total loser. 

All of my relatives went to college. All of my friends went to college, or are in college right now. Many of those friends were/are college professors. Hell, one friend is even a dean of a medical school. Yet, here I am, 18 years old, not doing much other than working on keeping my health above water (I have Cystic Fibrosis, so that shit's kinda serious, and it turns out my anxiety is largely genetic), and I feel like garbage for not being able to keep up with a single online course in writing, which is something I'm good at and really enjoy doing. I worked so hard and tried so many things to successfully graduate high school on time, despite multiple near-death-experiences caused by CF. I did it, and I took the fall semester off with the plan of starting college after Christmas, so I could begin working towards getting my associate's degree. 

But, that obviously didn't work out. I was doing so well until now, and to say I feel defeated is an understatement. 

I know it's not a race. If it was, I'd be well ahead of the game considering my health and circumstances. But, I am extremely competitive. Everything to me is a potential competition. I'm aware that is a very toxic and detrimental mindset, and I am trying to break it. It's just extremely difficult, especially when I look around and see just how successful everyone else has been compared to myself, even though nobody else was born into suffering like I was. Thankfully, those people have tried to assure me that dropping out was the best idea, and a few of them have humorously told me they would've given me a boot to the head if I stuck with that course long enough to pay a thousand bucks to fail.

4. Don't drive if you can ride the bus; don't ride the bus if you can bike; don't bike if you can walk.

5. Don't study in the library stacks; too many people will walk around and disturb you. Study in the Asian heritage section; no one ever goes in there.

6. Take the time to find the hidden burrito place; it will save your life when you're really hungry and it's a good place to take someone on the first date.

7. Get a work study job in the library if you can; food service work study will make you angry.

8. Don't try to study outside.

9. Don't defend your music/book/movie/political tastes by attacking another's.

10. Don't take up smoking as a habit, no matter what.

11. Write notes on anything and everything.

12. Don't buy one of those nifty ID cases with a keyring attached.

13. Don't fall for the easy student credit card applications.

14. Learn the name of the janitor who cleans your dorm and your class buildings.

15. Your first roommate is the first person you meet on campus. It's also the first person you will have disagreements with. Remember, he will be gone at the end of the year, but you'll remember him for the rest of your life.

16. Get stupid-loud-emotional-puking drunk once. Once is all it takes.

17. Learn to be homesick, but do it alone.

18. You will get horribly, terribly, awfully sick at some point during your first semester. Don't try to fight it or deny that it will happen to you. Go to the clinic, get some anti-biotics and let it happen. It will save you for the next 4 years.

19. Only order take-out once a month. Tip the delivery guy well (30-50%, he's most likely a student like you working his way through school).

20. Walk to bars; take a cab home.

21. Never drink alone in your room.

22. If you find yourself in a townie bar, have one beer, tip the bartender well and leave. If you go back, the bartender won't ask you for your drink order, he or she will just set it up on the bar for you without asking. It's an amazing thing to see when someone in service treats you with respect. Return it.

23. Find time to go to the gym.

24. Study two hours for every hour in class.

25. Eat in the dining hall. Avoid foods that don't involve silverware. Don't carb load at breakfast, eat a good-sized lunch, and don't overdo it at dinner. Sit down, eat slow. It should take about an hour PER MEAL.

26. There are 168 hours in every week. Subtract all of the class, study, gym, and eating time. You'll find that you won't be able to sleep 8 hours everyday. This is life, and it will prepare you for adulthood. Nothing interesting happens while you sleep, if it does, you shouldn't have been asleep in the first place.

27. Your professors (the ones with Dr. in front of their names or Ph. D. after) are your first employers. Learn what you need to learn but question them if it doesn't fit. In the end, they will be your job references after college.

28. Your graduate assistants and adjuncts are your peers. They have a lot of useful and pertinent information about how to get through these four years and in the end, the good ones will become your friends. Some of my good friends were once my GA's and adjuncts and we still chat frequently.

29. You will have veterans in your classes. Some folks around you will dismiss their training and experience. They have real world knowledge and have earned your respect.

30. Drink cheap beer when offered (Bud Light, Miller Lite, Coors Light). Drink good beer at the bar (Sam Adams, Dos Equis, Heineken). Keep better beer in your fridge (Murphy's, Bass, Flat Tire).

31. Wean yourself off caffeine during finals week. This may sound counter-intuitive, but trust me on this one.

32. You are not entitled to your opinion, you're only entitled to what you can defend.

33. You don't deserve a good grade for showing up. You didn't pay for ""A""s, you paid for the seat. Effort pays off, attendance is part of that. It's your money, make sure its well spent.

34. Find your professors' offices and learn their hours; you'll need them.

35. Accept that you will make mistakes and ask for help. It's easier to recover this way than trying to handle it on your own.

36. Be firm in your convictions; if you don't believe in something, chances are, you'll believe anything.

37. There is always a quiet place in the student center. You can usually nap there during the day.

38. When you're walking, keep your feet, but keep your head up. You'll be amazed at how many people will greet you when they can see your face.

39. Don't judge anyone by the anything other than their actions. You don't know their story, just as they don't know yours.

40. Don't text someone in the same room as you. If it can't be said aloud, it can wait until you're in private.

41. Don't email someone in the same building. Get up, walk to where ever he or she is and tell them face to face.

42. Not everything needs to be said. You'll learn what these things are as you go along.

43. Don't refuse an invitation to meet someone's parents. Shake their hands and refer to them as Sir and/or Ma'am until/unless they tell you otherwise. NOT BEFORE.

44. Your first summer job will set you up for success for the rest of your college career.

46. Go to the free concerts on campus.

47. Become a football fan.

48. The other people around you are in the same situation as you are. They are all scared, excited, tired, and apprehensive. You are learning how to adult; its a process; drive it when you can, but more importantly let it happen. The only thing you control are your own actions.

49. Listen to music at a moderate volume in your dorm room with the door open and without headphones. Good conversation starter.

50. Volunteer.

51. Understand what social location is, then pay no attention to it.

52. Buy a tailored suit.

53. It will probably be required, but even if it isn't, take a sports class.

54. Don't eat from the vending machines. Buy a package of your favorite snack and hide it.

55. Hide money in the pockets of your clean clothes.

56. When people hang out in your room, don't let them sit on your bed. During this time in your life when personal space is virtually non-existent, your bed is the closest thing to a sanctuary that you will have.

57. Make sure people take their garbage with them when they leave. This includes emotional garbage.

58. The required classes fill up early. Learn what a ""force add"" is and use it.

59. Wear shower shoes in the shower.

60. Wear house shoes unless you're leaving the building.

61. Own a crazy set of pajamas. Wear them to your earliest final every semester.

62. Send your mother a birthday card every year.

63. Don't let your personal life become a hassle for your roommates or your RA. They are students too.

64. Don't try to drill a hole in the keg to get to the beer inside. A repair bill for the consequences is not a joke. Trust me on this one.

65. Sit in the front of the class.

66. Wear a hat and a heavy coat when the weather gets cold; a hoodie won't cut it.

67. Wear shorts whenever possible.

68. Flip flops are perfectly acceptable. Crocs are never acceptable.

69. Get up early on the weekends. Your Monday self will thank you.

70. Learn how to fix your own appliances. YouTube and a good parts website will keep you from accumulating a storage bin full of easily repaired coffee makers.

71. Dress for dinner on Friday nights and encourage your friends to do the same. Jacket and tie for the men and a skirt/dress just above the knee for the ladies. Even if you’re eating in the dining halls, this will attract the right people to your sphere.",college,From my dad,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/evnxz3/from_my_dad/,1580327898.0
350,Lowkey_HatingThis,1579927369,/r/college/comments/etm9fz/had_really_good_highschool_scores_and_a_first/,"NY state if it matters. So I graduated #10 in a class of 80 in highschool, I came out with a GPA of like 94/100 I think? Idk its been a while. I had an SAT of 1410 and an ACT of 28, but the ACT I only took once. I had AP classes throughout highschool, but only took test for 4, the APUSH, which I got a 5 on, the AP English, which I got a 4 on, The AP BC Calculus, which I got a 2 on with a subscore of 3 for the AB test (so I failed the main one but just passed the part of the test that was graded on AB content, which didn't include series and sequences and polar functions), and a 2 in the AP chem test. Technically, I did get the best scores in my grade on the calculus and chem, because I was the only one in my graduating class who took them that year. Needless to say the teachers for those classes didn't prepare as well for just one kid. 

My point is, I worked hard in high school and I thought I did pretty okay. I got into a nice school and at like 20% of the cost. I went for physics, and had a pretty good first semester, a couple A's, a few B's, and a D, in my one physics course. I had a 3.2 gpa I think

Then it started to go downhill. There was a whole mix of problems, my home life with an alcoholic, my lack of interest in my major, constant personal money issues that I had to work two part time jobs over for a while, and ultimately my gf breaking up with me during finals of my second semester. My second semester I got a B in one class, a C in another, then all F's. My third semester I got all F's, didn't show up to a single final. Eventually I just stopped coming to classes. 


Here's a bit of back story about my mental state at the time and the impact it had on my performance in school, skip this paragraph to get to my question:

My mental state at the time was wrecked. A bit on my situation, I grew up from 10 years old until I moved out with an verbally and sometimes physically abusive step dad, who isolated me emotionally from my family, and my mother who had let it go on so long I didn't really trust or love her anymore. I had no love in the world except my girlfriend at the time, who I dated for a year and a half. Still, I wanted a family connection, so much went to live with my dad, who made more than enough money to pay the remainder of my tuition ($15k at a $60k school), but was a mean, vindictive, and mentally unstable alcoholic. I knew he was bad, I lived with him on weekends before, but living in the same house permanently was hell. He drunkenly accused me of taking his pain meds during my first semester mid terms. He called me vile names I won't type out. Anyways, he was as bad as my stepfather, I was crushed and depressed. Eventually, my girlfriend broke up with me. It was my fault, I had cheated on her at some point early in our relationship, and then lied a lot after that about partying. I loved her, I really did, cheating on her was a disgusting thing I did in a drunken blackout that I just can't live with myself for doing.She stayed with me for a year after that, I didn't cheat again, but she didn't want me out partying, and even tho I didn't often, every once in a while I'd sneak off and lie. Eventually sheeft and that was it, I had no contact with her anymore and when I tried to establish a friendship I could feel her lack of love or care towards what I had to say. Watching her face light up when I talked about something was the one thing of any worth I had left and I really didn't realize how bad depression could be until she was gone. I went into my third semester destroyed and unmotivated, and I just stopped showing up, got literal straight F's.  I spent the entirety of 2019 on academic suspension, getting high and working odd jobs. 



Anyways, my question is, will college's give a fuck. If I have high school scores from 2016-2017 that show I'm not a fuck up, will they give my troubles any merit, or will they just see the two awful semesters and turn me down?I want to apply to film school, even if everything was emotionally fine with me I still would have not liked physics, it was just work I wasn't interested in doing, not so much that it was hard and I struggled. But I've also had a passion for film and have recently been writing a screenplay and exploring photography. I even have an A in an intro to film class from my college first semester, which may be my best evidence of being able to do well in a film corriculum. 

My goal for now is to apply to a school I could get at like $10-$15k a year, which I think I could do for a lot of SUNY schools, I'm back living with my mom and her husband, who make less than $90k a year combined, my mom is actually unemployed, so I'd probably get a lot of financial aid benefits. I also want to go live on campus housing, I can't take it living here anymore, even if I have to pay a lot more a year for a dorm or something I'm fine with it. I want to get my gpa back up and get to 60 credits, I have 30 now at most, then apply to a nicer school I know won't accept me now, like a school in LA or NYC (I live in upstate), if I was freshly graduating I think I may have had a decent shot, but I'll be more realistic about my situation until I get my GPA up.


That's about it, thanks for reading my ramblings and I appreciate any and all help.",college,"Had really good highschool scores and a first good college semester, but my last two were awful, am I screwed?",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/etm9fz/had_really_good_highschool_scores_and_a_first/,1579945369.0
351,okiwent1,1579179437,/r/college/comments/epizdq/loan_company_denied_my_loan_application_i_do_not/,"Hi.

I'm a 21 year old first generation college student in my family who lives in Massachusetts. I will be attending an in state school starting the 21st where I will be living on campus for the very first time. Currently, I am a sophomore.

I was just denied by wells Fargo for a 9980$ loan that would have been used to cover the remaining costs of my college. My family is quite difficult to get along with. My mother hasn't worked in the past 2 months, because she has been dating a man who is quite well off, and has practically uprooted her life to go and move across several states to live with him. She is not able to cosign for me. My father is an unemployed, disabled individual who is on welfare. My grandmother has been forced into retirement due to her back injuries. And my grandfather, the only person in my family who would be able to cosign for this loan, simply refuses to do so. 

As of myself, I have held a steady part time job working 24+ hours a week since 2016. Back in september, I had finished an EMT course I took, and decided to go per diem at my job. I did not start working as an EMT until the beginning of November, specifically November 4th. During this time, I was hired as a part time employee. They sent me an email that held my hours that I would be working, and the pay I was receiving. Prior to my start date, I was able to speak to someone in our scheduling department, who was able to change me from a part time employee into a full time employee, and hence bump my pay from 15.50, to 16.50 an hour, with a 40 hour work week. No email with this information was sent out to me. I have made over $20,000 as of this year, in fact, I'm certain I'm past $30,000. 

I have a 754 credit score. When I turned 18, I immediately acquired a credit card and started building my credit. Several months after this I acquired a $5,000 car loan, and I have never missed a payment on either things. I did not recquire a cosigner for this car loan.

With college starting in 4 days, I am panicking trying to figure out what I can do to get this $9,980. Is there any way I can be approved for a loan? What should I do if I can't acquire a loan? I'm freaking out and it fucking sucks because nobody in my family has been through this, so I'm kind of searching in the dark with no luck. 

Any information is greatly appreciated. Thank you!",college,"Loan company denied my loan application. I do not have a cosigner available, and a payment plan is out of the question.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/epizdq/loan_company_denied_my_loan_application_i_do_not/,1579197437.0
352,MagiPan,1579136029,/r/college/comments/epbl3t/10_things_that_get_me_through_classes/,"These are things I do or think about that get me through my courses, especially boring or hard ones, so I can graduate. Doing these things help me get to my end goal so I can get a job and have them. 


* Number One: Pets! Looking at all the pets I can love because I will be able to afford them ( the pet itself, food, collars if needed, tanks, etc), their care (shots, surgeries, checkups) , and more (treats, treats, and oh! Treats). I would love to adopt animals from kill shelters and either keep them myself or take care of them until they can be re-homed. Also naming my future pets. 

* Number Two: Nice Homes! Looking at nice houses on Zillow in that county in my state with the nice high school that always win awards and scholarships. I also want to be able to afford to build a custom home that fits my needs.

* Number Three: Naming my future kids! Gives me something to call these cute imaginary *expensive* creatures, and humanizes my imaginary children so I am motivated to do my best so I can provide a better and safer childhood than I had. You know, send them to a daycare that doesn't have a secret baby fight club /s.  

* Number Four: Survival. You know, I like, uh, *being alive*. Homelessness is a good reason to want to succeed. You know, not worrying about *food*. Shelter, rent/mortgage, car payments. *Insurance* sounds nice.

* Number Five: Hobbies. I like to paint, but nice watercolours are expensive. *Copics are expensive*. I like BJD dolls. Those are *expensive^(2)*. I'm not into cars but I love Cadillac Eldorados. And I would love to own and race one. 

* Number Six: Big Projects! Things like wanting to own a side business separate from our actual job. I want to own and run a pet (not just cats) cafe attached to my own no-kill shelter with a veterinary clinic. I want to help fund tiny homes for the homeless. The homeless create a plan of success with the staff and live in the Tiny Homes until they can stand on their own (like getting a job and stuff). 

* Number Seven: Niceties! I have curly hair. That gets expensive to maintain real quick. I also want to take better care of my skin. Also expensive. My migraine diseases literally makes being vegan an easier option, but a lot of vegan replacements are expensive. Tattoos! Getting a cheap tattoo ain't it sis. Gonna get an infection or something ugly (prices depend on size, if it's a small tattoo it's gonna cheap regardless but go to a reputable shop and artist for God's sake)

* Number Eight: Sharing the love! I want to buy Valentine's and Christmas gifts for my mailspeople. I want to be able to give all my teachers and professors Teacher Thanks week gifts instead of picking a couple. I want to celebrate Librarian's Day with my favourite Librarian by buying her lunch and thanking her for the immense love and education she gave me. I want to give Valentine's and Christmas gifts to all my friends instead of just 5. I want to give the local dog down the road a couple treats here and there. But that gets expensive. (i have Doromania 😅)

* Number Nine: Travel! I want to go to France, China (I have to anyways for my degree), Japan, Korea, Dominican Republic, Barbados, everywhere! I love languages and instruments and when I travel to another country, I try to get a book in their language or an instrument special to their culture. 

* Number Ten A: Education! Some of you may be getting a degree that you don't like or that you like but not love because your actual interest would not pay very well. So we get our high paying degrees, get a job, save up, and go to school again to get degrees we love. I plan on going back for dual degrees in Sequential Art and Animation (Not that it doesn't pay well, my parents wouldn't pay for college if I went to art school). And then to France to get my Pâtissier certification!  

* Number Ten B: Education! Again! Some of you chose a degree you love, but also love other things and go after multiple degrees! Also expensive!! I know a girl who is triple majoring in Teaching, Animation, and Textile Painting, with a minor in Sculptures! She just loves to learn :D


Will I be able to accomplish all of the above? Probably not, but I definitely can't if I don't try. It doesn't hurt to dream big, as long as you set realistic goals and steps to get there. Plan ahead, save up, and dream big!

I currently attend my local Denver, CO uni for animation and I desperately want to transfer to a California college. I graduated a year early from college and I thought I would take a year to research schools and work on my portfolio but I made a gigantic mistake by signing up to take classes at my local school in the meanwhile. My school charges 3.5x the regular tuition rate for the animation major classes so I can only bareky afford to take the one or two classes a semester for my major. I didn't take any GE classes because I could even afford the major classes. I don't plan on graduating from my local uni with a degree. I desperately want to move away from home to live somewhere else but to transfer as a lower division transfer I need all of the GE class credits which I havent taken. Ive spent over a year extremely frustrated nearly crying myself to sleep every night over the fact that I'm stuck and I can't figure out how to leave. I could transfer to a California state college through Cal State or UC and have an extremely low acceptance rate for the very limited number of schools that accept lower division transfers and have an animation program, OR I could sell out and pay a million dollars out of loans to attend a private for profit expensive af scam art school with nearly 100% acceptance rate. I am desperate to move out of my parents house and away from my home town in order to be forced to be social in order to survive. I am extremely lonely everyday of my life as I cannot seem to force myself to be social when I have the safety and comfort of living sheltered at home. The only solution I see is to move away to another state where I have to eat, sleep, and breathe school 24/7 so I am forced to make friends. I do not want to spend a stupid amount of money to move out of my parents house if I'm going to stay in my hometown/homestate where I will still feel the constant urge to come home. It would be nearly impossible to earn all my GE credits by the end of the Spring 2020 semester to be considered for the rare chance of transferring as lower division.

354,oceaniye,1578776059,/r/college/comments/end42a/feeling_like_ive_failed_at_life/,"This is really long, and I apologize for that, but please bare with me as I am really in need of support.

I'm a 3rd year (out of 5) undergrad in biology. I began college majoring in Vocal Performance in the College of Music. I had never considered my future in terms of providing for myself or any type of financial or job security until my first semester of college and the harsh reality of it all led me to decide that I needed to explore other avenues. 

I took a semester to examine other fields of study and eventually decided on biology. My school has two different paths to take with biology, one being Molecular and Cellular, the other being Integrative, or organismal biology. Although I much prefer the MCB topics, I chose the IB route as MCB has a very strict path to follow in terms of sequence of classes and I saw pretty quickly that it would take me many years to complete the degree in that sequence with the extra foundational work I needed to get myself up to speed (I prepared myself in high school to continue with music and therefore very much lacked the math and science background I needed to begin biology) with other biology students. 

Anyway, I'm almost two years into my new major and I feel stuck and desperate. I love biology, with my whole heart. Music really was (and is) my dream but biology is my passion. I've thoroughly enjoyed most of the bio heavy classes I've taken and I know I chose the right major, but I'm not getting the grades I want nor the grades I think I deserve. 

Like most other college freshmen, I didn't know how to study. I graduated high school with a 3.85, having worked, what I thought at the time, was pretty hard. Looking back, however, I never studied but a few handful of times. Even still, I did very well. That level of work today would be earning me Fs though so I had to figure out how to be successful in college-level courses. I think I have done a pretty decent job and I've determined that on the metric of how well I feel I understand the content. I thoroughly enjoy reading my textbooks and diving deep into content, even supplemental content to help me better understand concepts at large and how they interact with each other rather than the general overview that is mostly presented in classes. By the time I am finished studying a concept, I can coherently explain pathways and mechanisms in great detail and I do so enthusiastically. When I practice, I turn to worksheets from class and sometimes problems from the text book. When studying for exams I turn to practice exams if offered and other material from class if they are not. Although I love biology and I want to learn more than just strictly the scope of the classes I'm taking, my time is very limited and grades are important so I try not to spend too much time on content beyond my classes and when practicing I focus on exercises given to me by instructors to limit any diversion away from course goals. 

Even still, I have a 3.1 GPA. I wanted to go to med school. My hardest classes are still yet to come (calc, physics 1&amp;2, 3 chem classes including orgo) and I have no background that will support me in these classes. I have been trying to practice and prepare my math skills as that is mostly where I falter, but I haven't been successful and I'm running out of time. I've taken precalc, finished with a C. I took a prepatory chem class, had a 90% in the class and a 91% exam average, then bombed the final despite studying and really understanding the content, ending with an 85%. I attempted physics last fall and after two panic attacks in the first couple weeks stemming from not being able to wrap my head around the concepts, I had to drop the class

I put everything I have into my classes, I really do, but, somehow, I can't prove it. I have ADD and bad anxiety and for these reasons I am registered with my school's disability resource department and I get testing accommodations through them. Without my accommodation I would be doing much, much worse and I can be thankful for that. I go to therapy regularly as well and I am putting in the work to better myself and become the person I want to be. Still, sometimes I have to use the portion of my accommodation that I have for anxiety because I am too anxious to leave the house or my panic surrounding an exam is so great that I cannot take it that day. Typically this is no issue and my professors are supposed to excuse me from attendance and other assignments for that day, as well as give me the opportunity to take the exam the following day, but I had a professor this last semester that absolutely would not give me that chance and due to loop hole in her course policies and syllabus, she didn't have to. I ended with a C in that class.   

I've had to start considering other options after college because I know my chances of getting into a medical school are pretty slim and quite honestly I don't think I have the room in my schedule anymore to take the supplemental classes I need  (biochem, a 2nd semester of orgo, psych, sociology) in addition to my major. 

I've been considering research, PA/NP school, and nursing school. 

PA/NP school seems unlikely being that they also require a higher GPA and supplemental classes, but mostly,  I don't think my heart is going to be in it. I've watched some YouTube videos about PA/NP school and done a little bit of looking around online and it seems that a big thing in PA/NP interview is the \*why\* you want to be a PA/NP and not a MD. Although I could maybe bullshit this, I know my heart won't be into it as much as it would be in an MD and knowing myself, it will show. 

Nursing seems like a good option but I fear that I will always feel, or at least will have to dedicate a good portion of my life to overcoming, the sense that I am living in the shadow of doctors; Why couldn't I have tried just a little harder and gotten the MD? No disrespect to other nurses, they are incredibly important, but ever since I changed my path, I dreamed of myself in other shoes. Additionally, I have really bad feet and seeing how nurses run around for hours upon hours, I don't think I could withstand the physical demand. 

And research, it just doesn't seem like anything I'm interested in, although I'm starting to feel that it is my best option. I have no background in research whatsoever outside of the lab portion of my classes. I will be looking for a lab to get into this semester as it is an important part of the curriculum for bio at my school. Again the only experience I have is in the lab for class and although I understand that they are not the same, I have hated every minute of the labs I have been forced to endure. Collecting samples is mind numbing, figuring out what tools to use and for what purpose for an experiment is honestly way above my head in difficulty and analyzing data is the absolute last thing I ever want to do. 

I took the time last semester to get my EMT license in addition to my normal classes, just because I really like medicine and I wanted a little taste of what it was like. Now, I really have a hard time accepting the idea of a future without a medical career. The notion of being presented with a problem, investigating in order to diagnose and then dividing a plan to treat, all under the premise of not only helping and supporting someone, but providing them with a better life, is exactly the piece of me that I want to give to the world. But, due to the poor metric used measure the capability and understanding of students, I don't think I ever can. Additionally, due to my poor grades, I feel that even if I do put myself into research job, I'll never make the money I need, especially not the money I want, to support myself, a partner, a family, and my mother who needs great financial help.

What can I do?

Edit: I also want to add that the idea of ""starting over"" at a community college is something I have considered but not really an option for me as I pay for school entirely unassisted by my family, through a $15,000 scholarship that ends next year and loans for all the rest.

355,Jam3sConn3r,1578774830,/r/college/comments/enctwm/a_reminder_to_say_thank_you/,"My father is a good man. He is the best man I know, and I am immeasurably lucky to have had him guide me to where I am now in life, which is a freshman at a great university. He also went to college. He worked two jobs to pay for it himself while maintaining a good enough GPA to apply to law school, in which he also worked multiple jobs. I don't work while at school, but I do 40 hours a week in the summers. My father grew up poor. Really poor. Hispanic kid in 60s California and Illinois trying to make ends meet poor. 11 siblings that all ate the same thing every day and didn't complain because they knew how hard their parents worked to put food on the table poor. I grew up asking for ten bucks to drive through Culver's with my friends. I grew up asking for something else if the dinner he made me wasn't what I wanted. My dad worked from 6 am to 8 pm picking cucumbers in 80-degree heat when he started middle school. I got my own laptop when I started sixth grade. My dad works long days, sometimes six days a week, at his office and has prosecuted more cases than most of his coworkers combined over his career. I go to frat parties and get so drunk that I have to go the hospital. I woke up this morning in the ER with an IV winding its way down my arm and my clothes in a bag behind the bed I was in. I loathe myself. My father brought me up strong, showed by example what a man should be, raised up good men in my eyes, and talked about his love for God so strongly that when I was young that I wanted to be a priest. Sometimes, when the world seems very quiet to me, I like to take a moment to remember the stories he'd tell me of the amazing people he has been blessed to work with over the years. He would talk of the judge, an old Irish catholic from Boston with a presence bigger than the room. How he would talk, and everyone would listen, hanging on each syllable, even the men standing before him accused of murder or violent sex trafficking or drug running, they all stood before him enrobed in the thoughtful cadence of his voice as he doled out wisdom from his seat. He talked of things like justice, yes, every judge should, but he also talked of compassion, of thoughtfulness, of honor, of strength of character and mental fortitude. He sat on the bench as a judge, but he stood before the room as a man, a model of what one should strive to be. He loved his wife dearly for over forty years and always took the time to shake your hand, look you clearly in the eye,  address you as sir, and ask you how you were, even the young men who came before him accused of heinous acts received the same solemn dignity that I did when I came in to watch my father work on warm summer days when my daycare wasn't open. He died last year. Pancreatic cancer. He fought it till the end, but the end was bitter. I won't soon forget how my father cried for this man. All my father said to me when he got back from the funeral was, ""He was a good catholic, but a better man."" My father worked many cases that this judge presided over and they were good friends in private, he was almost a second father to my old man. My dad's real father died when I was in third grade. Alzheimer's. I had never met him. My father's side of the family lived in Texas and for some reason we had never visited. That was the first time I saw my father cry. It broke me. He spoke at the funeral, between quiet, reserved moments of thought. That was the first time I had ever truly paid attention when my dad told stories about growing up. He talked about his father's life. Making a living during the depression, fighting in the second world war, raising 11 children on a car factory worker's salary. Teaching his children the value of their faith and each other. Never letting them forget the value of a dollar or a dream. Showing the resourcefulness of an eighth-grade education and the passion of an immigrant with a belief in the ideals of America. I could tell from the way the room was packed that this man was more than just a father. That was what I thought then, but remembering my old man speaking through teary eyes before his family, I now realize the man laying in the casket before him was exactly that: a father. He was the very best thing a boy could have. A father, a giant, a pair of calloused hands tucking you into bed after they worked a 14-hour shift placing the door on new model Chryslers they could never afford. A man who smacks you across your ear when you talk to loud in church and a man who picks you back up after you fall trying to learn to ride the secondhand bike he saved up for 3 months to get you. The sort of man you spend your whole life trying to grow up into, but always feel like you're coming up just short. The sort of man I hope someday my kids might be able to look to, and the sort of man my father is to me. But I let that man down yesterday and the shame and guilt are almost more than I can bear. But they were also a choice I made, and my father raised me up to own the choices I make. Laying on that bed in the middle of the ER I felt like dying. Not from the alcohol or from the embarrassment of the bad choices I made suddenly flooding to the front of my mind as I started to remember the previous night, not even from the thought of the bill that was inevitably coming in the mail. Those were all my choice and things that I could and will own. No, I dreaded more than anything the thought of telling my father, the man whose eyes filled with tears dropping me off at one of the best universities in the world because I now had ""the opportunities he never did"" and who was so proud to be able to pay for my tuition that he had saved for so that I ""wouldn't have to work the same crumby night shifts at the CVS"" like he did. How could I do this to my old man, who had given up so much for me. The same man who stayed up late hours to help me with my math homework after work so that I could get into that summer program. The same man who never missed a single one of my stupid tennis matches and coached every basketball team I was ever on. The same man who quietly drove me home after bad losses because he knew the music just made me angrier. The same man who spent what felt like years teaching me how to cast a rod only to see me give up after I got no bites in the first fifteen minutes. He is a colossus and I spent my childhood living in his loving shade. Now as I stare at the yellow patient ID bracelet on my hand, part of me can't help but smile. Not because I'm proud of what I did, there is no redeemable aspect of my actions and this I know. I smile because I know just how much my father loves me, and just how much I love him. I began writing this because I didn't have an outlet to put my emotions, a thousand miles from my home. I thought I understood how I felt and that the phrase ""I want to die"" pretty much encapsulated it. Now, more than anything, I want to live. To live to be the man my father wants me to be, to be the type of man I want to be. I'm still racked with conflict in my mind: sadness, regret, self-pity, disgust, and anger are all swirling through my thoughts. I'm still terribly afraid of the disappointment I know my father will feel. But I am strengthened by knowing I am my father's son. His love has always been my armor in this world, and it has enabled me to do great things. As I leave the world he prepared for me and start my life outside of his influence I am comforted by the knowledge that he raised me with every ounce of effort, courage, compassion, and conviction that he had, and, that while I will inevitably make mistakes, including many bad ones like last night, I have what I need to pick myself up, dust off my shoes, adjust the saddle and get back on the horse. No matter how many times it throws me. Now, I don't know if I will ever find the time or courage to show my father this, but I hope after you read this you can take some time to reflect on how much someone in your life has given you. Take the time to appreciate the small things they may do for you every day or the things they do for you without knowing it themselves. I hope you read this and feel like maybe you too can stand on the shoulders of giants like my dad, or your dad, or your mom, or your older brother, best friend, neighbor or cousin. We all have giants in our lives who raise us up to more than we thought we could be. Finding yours is important, but maybe more important is standing tall for others and making room on your shoulders for someone else's giant. So, if anyone needs a 5'8"" giant, I'll be studying for my calc final and trying my best to stand tall in the library basement.

356,yoiwantin,1578774398,/r/college/comments/encqa5/at_home_working_towards_a_major_i_hate_while/,"Hi,

I currently go to a local satellite campus of one of my state's public universities. I save about half what I would pay anywhere else in state due to no cost of housing (living at home). In addition, my parents insisted on paying my tuition as so I can avoid accruing debt. This is by all standards, a smart move and they are great parents. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, the thing is... I really fucking despise my major. I chose computer science for the sole reason that it looked like the least amount of school needed to get a 6 figure salary. At the time all I could think about was getting rich the easiest and fastest way and driving a Tesla and having a fat house and etc. All that has vanished. I want to live a modest and adventurous life traveling while still having a livelihood in something I like. My passion is music. I often fantasize about attending the Queens College of Music in NYC, but I know this is not practical and the cost of living alone would smoke my bank account for years.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I can't help but feel a void. Like something is wrong. I read about people like Ramin Djawadi and Howard Shore who attended Berklee College of Music, or John Williams who studied privately, played extensively, and studied in Arizona and the Julliard school. I admire these people greatly because it's not like they exactly had a back up plan, they went right into their passion despite it not exactly being ""marketable"" and are immensely successful.

&amp;#x200B;

I realize computer science is a much more safe option, and I will probably be richer, but I am certain I will not happier. Music is what drives me through each and every day. If I'm not studying, working, or socializing I will be in my room playing guitar, reading about scales, or downstairs on my piano. It's all I want to do. I would take up the violin too if I had more time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I a fucking idiot for essentially putting myself through misery for a safe and reliable degree? I understand this may come off as hyperbole or melodrama, but I cannot emphasize how much **disdain** and **hatred** I have for computer science, for the algebraic and abstract math surrounding it, for the toxic competitive culture, and that's just in school. Outside of school these fucking suits who won't even pay you expect you to spout code off the top of the dome on a fucking white board to prove you're worth not getting paid shit but ""gaining experience"" and ""making yourself more marketable"". Bitch please, I am sick of feeling like a spineless, trapped animal being dictated by the culture and academia of a degree I could **not give a single fuck about**. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really am lost and confused and just need some sort of guidance, or advice, or anything. I'd just like to know that I'm not alone or maybe you guys know someone who went through this. Really anything you share would be appreciated.

I'm a sophomore in high school right now and every time my parents ask me what I want to study in college, I always tell them that I'm interested in the field of psychology, specifically cognitive, perceptual, and especially experimental psychology. However, they always answer with completely serious questions and comments such as ""do you have a mental disease/need to go to a psychiatrist?"" ""Is there something wrong with you?"" or ""I guess we won't pay for your/let you go to college"". It gets me worked up because every time I tell them that psychology isn't just the study of mental disorder, they always answer with ""yes it is!"". I'm very interested in how subtle things all around us influence our psychology and I have a yearning to find how ""everything connects"", but I'm considering just doing something chemical or environmental if I can't convince them. Does anyone have any tips or suggestions for things that I can say to them to convince them? I'd honestly rather study a second or third choice with my parent's financial support than to attempt to take a psychology-based course in university without it.

358,gingermoonx,1578617688,/r/college/comments/emj63r/are_poorlowerincome_students_treated_differently/,"Over the years, I've read several articles and have heard from friends how low-income students are treated differently or poorly at universities. I never noticed anything of that sort at my school, so I didn't take the compliants too seriously. It wasn't until today that I had my own experience. Despite what my FAFSA might show, I do not come from a poor family. Thanks to my divorced parents, absent father, and my mom's really odd tax classification, I get quite a bit of financial aid on top of a scholarship. I tend to feel slightly guilty every year when I get my financial aid package as it feels dishonest in a way. However, I tend to get over that quickly once I realize how little I have to pay out of pocket. Despite coming from a fairly well-off middle class family, I receive no support from my parents. My step father is all about independence, so I was essentially cut off entirely at 18. No tuition, living allowance, or health insurance. So far, I've made it work and haven't had too much difficulty paying for school. Well, I'm currently in my last semester of university and will be graduating in 3 months. Due to some unexpected events, I owe the school 700 dollars this semester. It seems like a doable amount, but I've already been working 2 jobs at 40 hours a week while taking classes. I barely make enough money to pay my rent and transportation costs. Without my job in food service, I would actually starve. I don't spend money of useless things and tend to go without a lot of necessities such as glasses for my terrible vision. I also recently got laid off from my second job for unknown reasons, so 700 dollars is way out of my budget at the moment. After exhausting as many options as I could, I went to the financial aid office. I mean, they're supposed to help or at the very least offer support, right? I go in and speak to my PFC, and in not even 5 minutes she sent me away in tears due to how awful she treated me. She had absolutely no sympathy for my situation and told me that I should just pay the tuition with the money I make working. This was after I told her that all of my money goes towards rent and bills. She basically told me that I should be homeless. On top of that, I was told that maybe I should be more responsible with my finances so I don't have this issue. I literally live in the cheapest possible apartment I can with roommates, walk to school and work on a daily basis instead of getting a car, spent minimal amounts of money on food, and go without basic necessities such as medical care. None of this mattered. I get not qualifying for more free aid, but she wouldn't even give me resources for loans or scholarships. I can't accurately explain her tone or attitude, but it was honestly the worst I've ever been treated. At this point, I don't know how I'm going to pay for my tuition, but I'm sure I'll figure something out. However, I now understand what my lower-income friends go through on the daily, and they don't even go to private colleges like mine. Is this sort of experience common on most campuses?",college,Are poor/lower-income students treated differently at your school,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/emj63r/are_poorlowerincome_students_treated_differently/,1578635688.0

I was undergoing severe depression/ptsd/psychosis and was in the process of changing meds because the previous one had weight gain side effects. I lost eligibility for financial aid but they let me do a Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal (SAP) which is basically like a probation to regain elgibiltiy:I had to maintain a minimum gpa of 3.0 and pass 75% of the attempted units.

But I ended up not passing the probation. Last Fall 2019 I took 12 units (7 classes) and didn't pass 2 classes (4 units failed). Depression got worse during that time, abusive family situation got worse, my therapist quit and I was stuck with intern therapists that didn't help much, and the new meds I was taking had severe drowsiness side effects and I was hella tired all the time. But it's still on me and I fucked up bad.

This means I'm going to lose my future financial aid and if I want to continue college for another 2 years to be a music teacher, I'm gonna have to pay $3500 semester tuition out of pocket in monthly payments. I couldn't work in 2019 because I didn't have the mental energy to do so and do school full time unlike previous years where I did work part time and do school. I have no fucking idea how I'm gonna be able to manage to work 20 hours a week to pay $700 of tuition a month and attend school at least part time if I couldn't even do school by itself. My dad who was the income earner of the family recently got kidney dialysis and is currently trying to get disability coverage but for now cannot help with those payments. My grandma who's the owner of the house I live in can't help with money either.

I haven't got any notifcation from the financial aid office yet so I'm going there in person today or tomorrow to see what my options are. I can try asking my assistant dean for help but she probably can't do much and I'm also ashamed to ask for her help after telling her early in the Fall semester that I was confident I could pass all this only to end up eating my words as things got worse.

I feel hopeless, and that there is nothing I can do about it, and I can't drop out of college if I want to become a music teacher. I'm absolutely devastated.

360,adeleismeta,1577925688,/r/college/comments/eiqjck/is_it_wrong_to_ask_for_a_recommendation_when_im/,"So I will try to keep this brief but I need advice. This past semester I took the intro class for what I now decided is going to be my major. I had chosen something similar before but after this class I realized it was more specific to what I want to study. My professor is awesome, but I dealt with a few things this semester that made me a less than awesome student. I was super depressed after a passing close to me, and I was dealing with some health issues for a moment (and I don't have healthcare so I was also working insane hours to be able to pay for things). Anyway, towards the end of the semester I started slacking and I missed a quiz work 5% of my grade. No big, I thought, since I was on track to an A+ anyway. Life then hit me really hard and I didn't go to class for like 2 weeks (missed 4 classes). I was behind on assignments but my professor (thankfully) reached out to me to see what was up. I explained to her what was going on and she told me to just turn my paper in (I am a perfectionist and wrote a paper I didn't think was good enough so I just, didn't submit it). I submitted it and she gave me an extension on the 3rd paper since it depended on the feedback of the 2nd. Throughout all of this, I made sure to attend office hours when I needed help, and I got to know her better a bit. The last time I attended office hours was to clarify revisions for my 2nd paper, and we talked about school and she suggested I take 2 of her classes this upcoming semester (I signed up for them immediately because they are within the realm of what my concentration is). 

So here is my dilemma. I managed to get in the 3rd paper on time with the extension, and all other assignments when they were do. I feel bad because I should've reached out to her about what was going on instead of the other way around. She enjoys my writing and I enjoy her style of teaching and I feel like she is someone I could connect well/seek advice from with later when I'm getting really into my major. I am currently applying to a summer study abroad program and it has to do with my major and specifically areas her classes next semester will touch on, and it is an opportunity I do not want to miss out on by not applying at the very least. I should also mention she passed me with an A- when I probably deserved a B-. Anyway, I want to ask her for the recommendation because she knows me and my work well, and she also understands why I would want an opportunity to study this particular thing. I feel like after the shit I put her through with her basically holding my hand was enough and that asking for a rec at this point would just be pushing my luck possibly. I can't tell if I'm in my head about it. Another thing I'm considering is waiting until the 1st week of classes (Jan 13th) and asking her in person ??? but I feel like that may be too much pressure. It would give her a little under a month to write it as well so I need to decide quickly.

I dropped out because i knew by the then last semester that my mental health was awful and attending class was too stressful for me because i couldn't pay attention in class and couldn't be motivated to be consistently hard working and on task. 

by then i tried every adhd treatment and nothing really changed things without making the stress and anxiety in my life, which was already very bad, even worse. 

so i dropped out and in the 4 years i very aggressively worked with a psych trying literally everything you can take for GAD, depression, OCD, and ADHD all together. Because despite my track record, i do have goals and dreams i want to achieve. 

Nothing really changed my nature - which is having distracting thoughts and anger and emotional instability and no willingness to leave my mom's apartment - but my parents, my dad especially, kept on pestering me to go back to school. i knew i still wasn't ready but i also felt it had been too long since attending class that i needed to start doing something with my life again to feel better about myself. i hadn't been working either because my last job killed my self esteem because i was awful at everything and i couldn't even emotionally handle responsibility when i was working just 6 hours a week. 

This semester i have been taking 1 attendance-based class and 1 online class. The online class I am passing but the attendence class i might fail. It's an art class and i accidentally missed 1 project already (and there are only 4 projects) and this last project i can't understand the instructions even though they are written down in a handout. I have also missed a lot of class because i opted to stay home a lot because staying in my room is the only measure i can take that comforts my intense anxiety and depression and whatever else i have. when i'm outside i just hate everything and i'm constantly stressed out and exhausted that i'm not home.

So i don't know if i should even bother signing up for next semester. I'm starting to accept that i'm simply a loser, and while that isn't a productive thought, it's just starting to make sense because emotionally i am so messed up. 

like for the project that determines whether i pass or fail that i still need to do, my teacher has shown us a few videos of instructions, an in-class demonstration of the project process, and passed out a comprehensive write-up documenting the instructions of what we're trying to do, and i still have no fucking idea what i am doing. i literally can't comprehend or remember information that i want to remember, whether its written down or communicated verbally or demonstrated visually, and my problems solving skills....well, they don't exist at all.

so im at a loss at where my life turns to next because none of the medications im currently on, or have tried, work to make things different, and there are no medications left to try. the only psych medications that are left are for conditions i dont have. 

if i accept that im just an idiot loser that doesn't have the capability to even work towards my dreams, then i'll never be satisifed and i'd rather kill myself soon (as in the next few years, not right now) than see myself being in my current predicament and being 35 or 45 (im 26)",college,"I hate myself &amp; am mad at being lazy &amp; crazy, and i don't know if i should bother registering for classes next semester",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/eb47x1/i_hate_myself_am_mad_at_being_lazy_crazy_and_i/,1576459910.0

He then wrote me a check to my college with the same amount of money I would be receiving from the grant telling me to go to there office shove this in there face telling them I'm financially secured thinking I would be charged when refusing the grant money (I'm not going to do that as that makes me look like such an asshole).

I've called my college about it and they say I don't have to pay them back for this as long as I'm still going to my current college and not planning on dropping out, I've done some looking into about grant money if I have to be a full time student to receive it because my father was also saying ""they will see your not a full time student and charge you"" and all I've seen is that the amount of grant money is determined if your part timer or full timer, there also the fact I did my FASFA with my mother before the deadline. I try to explain this to my father telling him I won't accept any more after this but then he start to tell me that by the time I graduate this will just add up costing me if I accept it and then went on about a story he heard from this customer who was charged a shit ton of money due to the offers he accepted even though my college has mentioned that I don't need to pay this grant money back and can refuse any other grant money in the future (which i'll probably do just to be safe).

I got to my honest despite being financially secured it might be nice to have an extra 2k in my pocket especially since the money is unrestricted like a friend told me about it (I would prob save it for emergency's and school supplies), but yea I just wanted to ask this subreddit and anyone who has had experience with grant money if I should accept it and from what my father says ""learn the hard way"" or refuse it despite it apparently being ""free money""

To give a bit of context my father is a man who is always hard working his entire life 24/7, been running a convenient store he been running since 2001 besides all the past jobs he had before setting with a corner store. he always suspicious about stuff and seeing things in a different perspective also can be out of the loop with current year stuff (I can understand why he dose not think anything is free in life xd)",college,Should I accept grant money despite being financially secured?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/eagz2i/should_i_accept_grant_money_despite_being/,1576327545.0

My girlfriend and I are both transgender women and I go to school at Virginia Tech. It was hard enough to convince her to move with me from CT/MA respectively, but we got by for awhile until she started facing discrimination at work. Like me, she put her degree on hold for a bit to transition, so coming into Blacksburg, the best job she could find was at a restaurant making $15 an hour.  

&amp;#x200B;

It paid our bills, but took a heavy toll on her. I'd find myself staying out with her until 3:00am and would skip out on homework and studying to make sure she didn't self-harm - something she had done in the past... I don't regret any of it, but at the same time, I don't know how to justify it, especially to my mother. Technically speaking, I'm an independent, however, she still provides my health insurance, which I need to continue hormone treatment along with coverage for an upcoming surgery. My worry, aside from how to pay my loans when the grace period is up, is what I'm going to do about my medication and surgery. I need it to remain mentally stable, I can't go without it.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to mention the fact that I already took academic relief when I came out, and this pushes my degree out two and a half years. I'm already $35k in debt because I'm still technically an out-of-state student. I really have no clue what to do and I need to come up with a solution before the end of finals on the 20th... I mentioned transferring to a different school to my mother, and she automatically pinned it on my girlfriend moving back to MA (she does not like her whatsoever and continues to try and have me break up with her). 

&amp;#x200B;

Even if I wanted to transfer, I couldn't because my GPA is too low. UCONN expected a 3.5 and I'm not even remotely close. My girlfriend wants to study music in Washington, and I'd like to go with her if I can. I just don't know if it's even a possibility given the state of my finances and GPA. For context, I would probably end up transferring to University of Washington, Bothell even though it's not as good of an engineering program.

I had finished an assignment of 800 words (separated into different questions) and was ready to submit my assignment at 11:44pm. RIGHT when I press submit I am taken to the log in page and my heart drops. I now have to rush over and submit my assignment in the Text Box AGAIN in the same format, all separated out and numbered, as fast as I can as I now had 14min to write the entire paper. 

Riddled with spelling errors and syntax I am able to squabble out less than half of the assignment in that time before I am forced to submit it at 11:58 before the assignment closes. I am so angry right now but mostly wondering where all this free time people keep talking about comes from for me to actually sit down and do my assignments when the sun is up.

My teacher has a whole page and a half on her home page on canvas about how no matter what you have to meet the deadline even if you have technical problems. I am still going to try and ask for a little leeway in this situation because even though that's impossible it's the only option I have. I pay out pocket for my classes so I'm not too mad since I was able to earn enough to not be into debt. But I am still angry that no matter how hard I worked on perfecting that paper it all blew up in my face

I know I should have probably emailed a link to a google doc instead of doing it in the Canvas Text Box but it was a quick option and I didn't think I had time as I got right to typing.

This is why I hate college. It has never been hard for me and I haven't learned a damn thing my entire time here. I am smart but because of shit like this and my seeming inability to balance work/school/family I am watching myself hoping to scrape by in this and one other class. To me it's just not worth it but I can't quit either because if I do then I will have no money as I already paid for next semester and quitting now would have me kicked out with less than $50 extra dollars for the month that has to stretch to cover gas/food/rent. I can re-register still which is good but I shouldn't even be in this position.

Why should I struggle so hard when I am not even sure if it is worth it. I am seriously debating ditching my dream major in pursuit of a quick trade to help me make time for school, but that's scary too because that's what everybody says they'll do then they get stuck in the real world and its 10 years later. I already don't even have time to see friends and haven't since this time last year. All the money I save gets spent and it's never going to be enough. 

Either way I'm pretty sure i wasted $700 on something I probably should have done over an extended lunch break, at least some of it. I know I'm at fault, great, I know what to do, good, but Fuck My Life. 

All I learned in College:

- Content/originality DOES NOT MATTER, follow the guidelines, follow the rules, then add filler.

- Write what YOUR professor wants, nothing more, nothing less.

- Grades DIRECTLY CORRELATE to a student's ability to learn/succeed

- C's (sometimes D's) get degrees

- FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY, this way you are protected from bad instruction/mistake from administration

- School events/clubs/activities are basically only attended by the types of people with that much free time.

Then, I thought of doing Computer Science/Software Engineering, and then I realized I strongly disliked programming and coding. I resolved to majoring in Biology, and then planned on moving on to PA school, until I realized how much PA school costs, how much work needs to be put into it, and how much I'd actually dislike doing work as a PA. So, I decided to keep majoring in Biology, but move onto teaching at universities instead with a PhD in Biochemistry. 

However, I still feel as if I'm fucked.

For some reason, I was sure for many years before college that I wanted to pursue computer science (I've just been a computer guy, and was involved in some activities like robotics and game development and stuff in high-school, so it seemed natural), however coming into university, I've realized that I am no longer passionate about studying computer science, and can't see myself working in this industry for the rest of my life. I know the pay is good, and the career opportunities are there, however I do not at all want to be a software engineer or something along those lines. I like interacting with people, and I'm much more interested in pursuing some sort of a business/finance degree (both of my siblings pursued these degrees and are doing quite well in the industry now).

I was very excited last semester, but this semester I've felt very hopeless. Every cost-based thing my school does makes me feel even more scammed.

The reason I'm wanting to take a semester break from college is because of financial issues. I do have a great scholarship from my school for $5,000 per semester which pretty much takes away half of my bill, but at the same time paying for that other half becomes the issue. I was able to apply for a federal loan for $15,000 but looking into it, I am apparently only eligible for part of what I requested due to how much my parents make. So I'm still stuck with my remaining amount of $3,000 to pay out-of pocket.

Just like my other siblings that went to college, college is something I have to either pay for myself or take out student loans. Right now, both of my parents have student loans for my older brother who just finished college, so neither are able to apply for a student loan for me.

Basically, I'm asking if it's a good idea to take a semester off from college (since I can't apply for spring semester classes until I have my bill completely paid) and just work from late December up until Mid-August to save up money to be able to pay for some of my bill and also give my brother time to hopefully pay back one of my parents?

That being said, I've never been stellar at math stuff. Numbers don't always process for me and it's difficult interpreting some of the information, so I've been going to SI sessions and plan to get tutoring on the side to help me improve. But my teacher/lectures are just downright awful. 

We learned naming in 10 minutes on the very last class before the test. Copped a F A T  **f** on that so I'm already feeling like a complete meathead. I've been doing fine in pretty much all my other classes, including anatomy/physiology, so I'm hoping I can pass with A's and B's there (because I have always been academically subpar/average and that's about my expectation) but Chem is either going to be an utter failure or a fat C. And I'm not sure if that'll keep me in Nursing, and I'm very afraid of that. Because A) my family has offered me no help in terms of fall-back plans on what I can look into if nursing doesn't work out, insisting I stay on this track or perish and B) the first alternative that comes to mind is Environmental Science, which also requires me to take Chem. But ES is something I actually kind of want to explore because I worked at a park for three years and learned a lot about forest ecology and really enjoyed the concepts behind it.

So I've come down to another problem: money! Because we already took out about 10k in loans for this year and boy-oh-fucking boy am I terribly afraid of what I'm going to do if my career doesn't let me pay that off effectively! Of course I'm aiming for Nursing for better reasons than the obvious job security involved and the pay, but those are pretty good incentives. But when my family isn't helping and I don't feel good enough for anything, the range of options feels so fucking small that I don't even know what to do with myself. Urban planning? English teacher? I've always been good at reading and writing, but those aren't really things I can get a decent job for to pay back all the money I'm going to owe.

So, yeah. I don't think I can pass Chem well, but if I can aim for a C or B that'd be greeeeat. My grades now are already in the shitter, but it's early in the year and hopefully I can turn it around with enough effort. But fuck, it's not looking good for me chief. 

I can do well at everything else but Chemistry, a class I passed in High School, is what's going to do me in. I don't know if there's a proper word for how sad that makes me.

But yeah, I know it isn't the biggest thing in the world but all that shit makes my future feel so damn *bleak* you know? I can't even look forward to the next decade of my life because the only associations I can make are being incredibly stressed and between jobs.

386,bl1y,1567610501,/r/college/comments/czmar9/im_an_adjunct_professor_and_every_single_day/,"For those new to how academia is structured, adjunct professors are part-time, hired on a per-course basis, paid very little (I think national average is under $3k per 3-credit course), and are largely folks fresh out of grad school hoping to get a foot in the academic door. (Some others are older people with decades of experience teaching because they enjoy it, or as a form of semi-retirement.)

I used to have some hope that if I paid my dues, eventually I might be able to work my way into a term faculty position -- full time, but not tenure track. My department has basically closed the door to that. All new term faculty positions will conduct a national search for faculty, no preference is given to people already working there, and in fact having years of experience as an adjunct is a *negative* on your application. Since that happened, things that I used to let slide off have started piling up instead. It's fucking awful.

To start, the pay, god damn. I get paid less than 5% of the total sticker price of tuition for my students (their tuition just for the class, not the total each is paying for everything). I know lots of students get scholarships and stuff, but even if the average student was paying only *half* sticker price, I'd still be paid less than 10% of the total. Students might think they're paying for an education, but they money isn't going towards educating them, it's going towards creating a new vice-deanling of setting money on fire.

A ton of us got our hours cut this year. The norm was to teach a 2/1 schedule, meaning 2 courses in the fall and 1 in the spring, or a 1/2. The university caps us at 3 total. But, this year my department hired a *ton* of its own fresh graduates as adjuncts meaning there's not enough classes to go around and most of us just get 1/1.

I can't get our administrative assistant to answer a god damn e-mail and have to track them down in person, which isn't feasible when I have class starting *before* the department office even opens, and then office hours following that. When I do finally get a response I get repeatedly lied to. Just one small example, I got told by e-mail that dry erase markers are well-stocked in the supply room. Just plain false, they're under lock and key in the department office and have been for years. Last year we had to sign them out. 50 cent markers.

Our ""office"" space is a fucking joke. I'm in a windowless basement cubicle farm with ancient computers and busted up furniture and have to time-share my space with 3 other people and then get moved to another cubicle every semester.

This semester I needed IT support with both my ID card not logging in to the printers and my computer not even being connected to the printers. But, when you teach a morning class, IT doesn't even arrive until an hour after I'm done teaching.

They used to have locks on the paper trays in the cube farm for god knows what reason. And guess what happens if you need to refill a printer tray before the admin office opens? Rekt. The only reason there aren't locks on any more is because someone forgot to lock them back and I just fucking hid the locks behind the printer.

Despite massive expansion on campus (we just got 3 big new buildings) we're still somehow over-crowded and classes are now being held in an auxillary building. It's not super far, but it is about a 15 minute walk from the rest of campus. A lot of faculty and students complained, asking to have classes moved back to the main campus, so what does the administration do? It sends out an e-mail clarifying that this building is part of the ""main campus."" Not ""we're sorry for the inconvenience but we're doing the best we can,"" nope. Just ""fuck you for complaining, now watch as I lie to your face about it."" I replied to the e-mail with a link to the campus map which clearly distinguishes the building from what the map calls ""main campus.""

We have an adjunct professional development fund that amounts to a whopping $50 per faculty member to help pay for things like travel to conferences. It's only enough so that about 50 out of 650 adjuncts can get the full amount available. And it's first-come, first-serve, so fuck you if your conferences are in the spring.

There's a $17,000 projector in my classroom that I don't get to use because the university won't provide me with a $150 tablet. Their response was that if I want to use it I need to bring in my own personal laptop. You know what happens if my laptop gets damaged from the wear and tear of traveling back and forth to campus? I'm homeless.

And I know someone's going to be thinking ""you should unionize""... we are unionized, and the union sucks! The last two contracts they've only managed to negotiate wage increases to match inflation. The board of trustees allocates money for our pay way before negotiating begins, then their lawyer shows up and just says they can't give us any more and the union's been taking it for years.

One last thing, paying adjuncts more would *not* cause tuition to go up. Tuition isn't based on how much the university needs, it's based on how much the university can squeeze out of you.

It was affecting my mental health, my life, self-esteem... The main reason was the course I chose, which was journalism. Well, I ended up ""choosing"" it because my family made me do it, actually. I didn't exactly choose it myself. 

Even though, I was trying to stay positive. I love to write and that was what I wanted to focus on during the course. The thing was, there was barely any writing at all. The whole course was a mix of press journalism, radio and television. First year was... okay. I had quite interesting classes and nice professors. But the second year was a nightmare.

I'm a very shy person and I use to rather stay in the back, so going to the ""television class"" and having to perform in front of other students, very demanding professor AND a camera was a really big challenge. I was trying to stay strong, sure, constantly reminding myself *""it's okay, on third year you're gonna choose a specialization, you'll go for press and won't need to worry about any cameras anymore""*, but it was still so hard to deal with the harsh reality. 

I was skipping the television class as often as I could. In fact, I attended just two times and then, finally realizing I can't go on like this and maybe journalism just isn't for me - I gave up. 

I took a year off, gap year of some sort, and found a... horribly affecting my mental health job. This year spent at my work place made it even worse for me than the whole journalism journey, not gonna lie. My depression reached its peak, I had to start taking medication, deal with constant anxiety and panic attacks, and if that's not enough I've developed OCD and suicidal thoughts.

The thing is, October is coming with such big steps and I know my Mom is expecting me to come back to college, find a new course, start studying again... But I don't feel like doing it. 

I know it's gonna tire me out again, both mentally and physically. Cause if I'm gonna come back, I'll be attending school on weekends. So it will be work on Monday to Friday and then college on Saturday and Sunday. The first year of college was okay because I wasn't working yet, but on the second year I was and with all the stress from the course, the additional work wasn't helping, just made it even worse like I said; But I have to work. If I'm gonna be going to school again, I have to pay for it and I don't want to burden my mom with all the money and everything. 

I know that if I decide not to come back, I'm gonna feel even worse than I already do. I'm gonna blame myself for being like this and feel like a failure again, like I disappointed everyone: myself, my mom... Like my sister is just gonna get another reason to make fun of me. 

She's a student too, she goes to college on weekends too, she works too - and she's dealing with all of these so well. I feel like Mom is so damn proud of her. Sure, they argue a lot, it's hard for them to find a common language sometimes, but it's not a secret it makes Mom proud to say how amazing and talented one of her daughters is, right? And then there's me - a college drop out who complains all the time because my coworkers hate me and make fun of me, because I'm depressed and feel alone, because I just can't find a place for myself in this world.

Plus study groups. I could go to a library but that wouldn't work at night (I'm a girl).

Probably the only pro for staying at home (apart from cost) is that it's quiet. I think I do want to be around people more but I'm still introverted and I hate noise. It's possible I wouldn't enjoy living in that sort of environment... sucks this sorta puts me at odds with myself. There's some quieter halls available but I don't know exactly how quiet ""quieter"" is, or if the people in those halls would be willing to make friends or not.

And then there is the debt, of course. Living in a hall for the first year would cost me about 15k to 18k. Thinking of studying computer science or software engineering and there's no interest on student loans here... but that is still a massive, massive amount of money and being that much in debt surely will impact me later in life.

400,Last_Kindheartedness,1564517926,/r/college/comments/cjxfv4/what_someone_should_have_told_you_before_starting/,"Just making a list of some helpful tips and tricks I learned while in college.  Please add any things I may have missed. Use whatever applies to you, and hopefully you get something out of it.

1. **College is not mandatory/It is not mandatory to go to college right away:** It might sound hypocritical for a person who has a college degree to be telling people not to go to college... but it's the truth.  I know there is SO MUCH PRESSURE in highschool and in society in general, especially with social media, to talk about what college you're going to. And thinking ""oh my gosh I'm missing out on my ""college experience!"" But think about it.. was high school really all that it was made out to be? It's OK to take a year or two to figure shit out.  Life's not a race.  And if what you want to do doesn't require a degree... DON'T GO TO COLLEGE!
2. **Return on Investment:** Not to knock on anyone's degrees cause like you do you boo.. but like spending $30,000 to end up going back to working your college barista job is just plain stupid.  Research the shit out of your degree job prospects, make connections, set yourself up for success... 
3.  **Go to Community College First:**  Now if you are set on going to college.. go to community college first.  Every single person who goes to college needs to take the same general education classes regardless of major. Whether your major is drama or engineering, you will still get stuck having to pay for that damn music or art history class in order to complete that one general education requirement to get your degree.. why not pay a fraction of that cost in community college.
4. **Live at home (if you can):** I know.. you're finally an ""adult"" you want to assert your independence on the world and get the hell out of your parents house.  In your eyes.. College = Finally being an adult. no rules.. complete freedom.   But lets take a few steps back and slow your roll down before you make an extra $10,000 mistake. Spending one two extra years at home to figure shit out won't kill you.  Or just think, Wow I just saved an extra $20,000 (aka a brand new car by staying home!).. also free home cooked meals are something you will miss when you're out on your own.
5. **Go Public Not Private:** At the end of the day a degree is a degree.. no one cares where you got it from... do you really want to spend  40k a year on something you could have got for 6k a year...  Same goes with loans... always choose public instead of private
6. **Never Buy New:**  The college bookstore is probably the most greedy fucking place you will ever see.  Always look and compare your textbooks online.  Also.. if you know you are never going to use that intro to biology, or womans history book ever again... **RENT the textbook**.  **Use textbook comparison websites** like **(**[**slugbooks.com**](https://slugbooks.com)**)** and find the cheapest books you can.
7. **Email your professor before the semester starts:** Going back on textbooks.. a lot of companies will force you to buy new to sell ""supplemental criteria"" aka an access code, or cd.  Email your professor first.  Ask if it is 100% necessary to have that material in order to be successful in the class. 9/10 times you never use it, or you use it once.  If it is, try to find it online, if you can't then see if your college library may have the cd for you to borrow to finish your assignments.  If you have to have that access code.. then I'm sorry but you gotta buy it new unfortunatly :(
8. **Minimize the amount of loans you get:** Aka apply to scholarships... grants... sell your left kidney.... (joking..) but student loans never go away.. so minimize it as much as possible.  Minimize your costs.. you are a college student.. live like one.  And if you do need loans, try and get subsidized loans
9. **Scholarships.. Grants... Loans:**
   1.  **Scholarships:** AKA free money... apply to them... regardless.. just write the damn essay and apply.. you will most likely get at least one.  
   2. **Grant's:** Aka free money you do not have to pay back... Take them.. as much as you can get 
   3. **Loans:  WATCH THIS VIDEO....**  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUqmdwqfvZM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUqmdwqfvZM)  
      1. Private Loans: Charge a crap load of interest and are expensive.. Do not recommend
      2. Public Loans: Lower interest in general
      3. Subsidized Loans: a type of public loan where interest does not start accruing until after graduation or after you stop going to college. (recommended)
      4. Unsubsidized Loans: Another type of public loan where interest accrues every single day you have that loan

402,vladbootin,1564295587,/r/college/comments/cismo7/i_need_some_advice_regarding_finding_a_potential/,"Hey, so quick back story.

I'm in my mid twenties and am attending a community college. Currently have a 4.0 GPA, aiming to stay above a 3.7GPA. I work full-time and attend part time (11 credits a semester is usually what I try to stay around). My job is flexible and allows to me take a class in the morning, but it can't be a ""regular"" thing. Doing it every other semester would probably be fine, or if the classes are on the shorter side (i.e, can fit into an hour lunch). I don't plan on moving as of now, mostly because my girlfriend just started her job. Otherwise, we've talked about moving to Philadelphia soon-ish (maybe next 3 years). I live in Northampton County in PA currently if that helps answer any of my questions.

&amp;#x200B;

**What I'm looking for:**

* College with *some* night or online classes. Like I said above, I can take day classes occasionally.
* Cheaper is good, but necessary. I'd rather pay more and have more flexibility in most cases.
* Would like the program to be decent. I work as a Software Developer now, so ideally having a good program and more niche classes is great. Some classes I've already read in a couple of colleges was ""AI Development"" and ""Machine Learning"" for example.
* Looking for something either mostly online &amp; reasonable distance from me, close to me, or entirely online.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I'm having is it seems like the schools near me don't offer undergraduate online programs, they don't offer Computer Science online/at night or they don't have night classes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Different schools I've considered or I'm looking at:**

* Moravian
   * Limited online and no night classes at all.
* Lehigh
   * Only graduate online programs, extremely limited night classes.
* Lafayette
   * Couldn't find information on either night classes or online. Plan on calling them
* Muhlenburg
   * Seems to have online and night classes, but not any in depth explanations. Plan on calling them.
* DeSales
   * Seems to be the best option. It's close, has some night classes (supposedly. My professor swore they do and recommended them) and has online classes. Will be calling them in a few weeks. More on the expensive side.
   * I'm really hesitant though because this is a *strict* Catholic college. They require 3 Christian related classes. One is entirely about Catholicism and the ""intermediate"" courses include arguments against birth control and per-marital sex...
* East Stroudsburg
   * State school. Second best option because of how cheap it is and it apparently offers some night/online classes.
   * The only thing holding me back is how far it is. It's an hour one way, so that's potentially 2 hours a day that I'm not able to do anything other than drive to/from class.
* Penn State World Campus
   * I'm strongly considering this, but it's expensive. It's $587 credit (not including fees) and would cost me $50k while something like East Stroudsburg would cost me $20k. Entirely online though, so this is the most flexible.

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions:**

1. Are you aware of any other online schools I should look into?
2. Any advice on how I could easier find schools with night classes? Apparently they aren't rare, but it seems like they are to me. As of now I'm looking through a colleges website until I find relevant information, which in most cases it's none.

403,BunchaBunnies,1564251757,/r/college/comments/cikyxq/how_does_student_income_affect_financial_aid/,"I'm going to be a sophomore soon in August. I recently took up a job (my first one!) and will start another one at the end of the year. I plan to be working until I graduate. Right now I estimate my annual income might be something like 15k from 2020 onward, with potential to go up. A little about my financial situation: My EFC is 0, and I pay about 6k per year out of pocket for college. I have no loans currently because my parents can afford to pay in full. But I'm not sure how that might change with my new student income. 

I did some research, and I am aware that FAFSA allows students to make 6k, then 50% of everything after is deducted from your aid. I also know that because they only look at tax returns from the prior-prior year, my financial aid for college is relatively unharmed since they will only see my 2019 tax info when I apply for FAFSA for senior year in 2021. And I don't think I'll make over 6k by the end of this year so that should be fine. However, I'm pretty worried about what happens when I apply for aid for grad school (going to PA school or med school). 

So a few questions I can't find clear answers to: 

1) What is the income protection allowance for independent unmarried graduate students? I haven't been able to find a solid number (probably because there isn't one considering so many factors) but what is a safe number to stay below? 

2) If I get direct subsidized loans and pay them off after I graduate college, does that affect the amount of aid I'm getting for grad school in any way? 

3) How do expenses like rent and paying off your credit card balance affect aid? Where do I report these expenses? No matter my income, I know 30% is going to rent. And there's also also the occasional shopping spree, but I know to keep my credit utilization low and I pay in full every month. 

4) In general, how do expenses affect your aid? Hypothetically, if I earned 15k but (irresponsibly) used it all for whatever, does FAFSA still count money you no longer have as money you can use to pay for school? 

This is the first time I've ever had an income of my own and I'm trying my best to learn how to manage my money, etc. Even if I didn't work, I'd think my parents would still be able to afford for all of my expenses even though we're low income. But I don't want to rely on them so much, and I want to become more independent and start saving up to pay for college/grad school on my own. It just sucks to think that me doing extra can probably not only hurt my aid but also burden my parents even more. Any sort of advice would be helpful, but if anyone can help answer these questions I would greatly appreciate it! :D",college,How does student income affect financial aid?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cikyxq/how_does_student_income_affect_financial_aid/,1564269757.0
404,funkymoko,1564166909,/r/college/comments/ci6t0v/what_should_i_do_with_my_life_would_you_go_to/,"I'm kind of at a crossroad in life.

I have been working since I was 14 after being forced to drop out of school due to family circumstances. I'm 21 now, so I've been working a fat minute. I spent most of that time working for myself, doing things such as painting peoples houses, flipping cars and other stuff on craigslist, lawn work, and other home improvement work that pay pretty decent. I have also worked a few jobs as an employee, ranging from being a cashier and an assistant manager at a grocery store to scooping up literal feces at a water cleanup/restoration company.

What I have learned during this time is that I would like to create something that is my own and work for myself. I could continue that right now, but I do not find much of what I do in terms of work as exciting or fulfilling. I've been working physically-demanding jobs since I was 14 and I don't think I want to do that the rest of my life. Sitting at a desk 8 hours a day doesn't sound fun either though haha, but is an improvement. I thought college might be my next step either way.

It has been a dream of mine to continue my education finally, so I would definitely like to go to college. I also don't know many people due to dropping out of school (and having migrated to the US when I was 13, so no childhood friends close to me.) I feel that going to college would not only fulfill my dream of continuing education, but I would also be able to make friends and connections that I have been longing for since moving to the US.

The problem is that I have zero passions. I've researched so many degrees to see what I might like, and I have not found much. The thing I really enjoyed most in school was acting and theater, but that was over seven years ago, and I don't want to get in debt for a degree that probably won't pay itself back. Also, I was literally a child at the time, so I don't think I should base my college education off of a class that 13 year old me really enjoyed. Or should I? I figure if I can't find something I'm interested in, then a degree in either Computer Science or Business/Finance would be best right? Either degree could help me advance a future company that I create, and they would also have good job prospects if I don't create anything. Both degrees would also open up new business opportunities. I'm utterly neutral to both degrees. I have, however, heard people on this subreddit say that if you don't live and breath computer science/programming, then it's probably going to be a miserable time? How much more miserable than painting and cashiering?

I'd heard of college students being poor, living off of ramen. I thought they were poor because they were too busy with school with not enough time to work. 

I've been lucky enough to earn a living on my high school diploma and make too much to qualify for much help for them, and at the same time am too middle class to be able to help them much. 

I have two daughters, both about to start Freshman year. My older daughter (23) has her heart set on an art college. I've attempted to steer her away from it, as it is a very expensive school, she's quite introverted and has been making semi-decent money ($15 hour) in retail. 

My second daughter (18) is going to go to a much cheaper school, at least half the price of the other one. Her school highly suggested getting a long term, low interest student loan administered by a state agency. It requires a co-signer. This same loan is available to my first daughter.

Both have done their FAFSA, applied for scholarships for being left-handed, 50% hispanic, etc.

407,bl1y,1563549366,/r/college/comments/cf8s7p/im_an_adjunct_professor_and_were_preparing_to_go/,"Posting this because I figure it's useful for students to understand how their universities function and because I'd like to know how students would respond if their professors went on strike.

First some background for people who don't know how the adjunct thing operates; you can skip ahead if you're familiar.

Adjuncts are faculty members who work part-time for the university and are typically paid very little, around $3000-5000 a semester for a 3 credit course. There's two main varieties of adjuncts. The first are the Industry Adjuncts -- these are people who've had substantive careers outside academia and are returning to share their expertise. The second are Career Adjuncts -- these are people who want to be professors and start teaching right out of grad school. Industry Adjuncts are typically well off financially from their previous jobs, many are in retirement, and they get paid more for their classes (some getting more than $10,000). This post is about Career Adjuncts -- the people who grind out a living working multiple jobs at once and are hoping they'll eventually get a full time teaching job, even if it's not tenure track. Most of the adjuncts you'll encounter are the Career Adjuncts, they're the ones teaching the 100 level courses and are nearly half the faculty at some universities.

My current pay rate is just over $4,000 per course. So, if I wanted to earn a moderately decent salary of $48,000/yr (with zero benefits!) I'd need to teach 12 classes. A standard full-time teaching load for a professor with no committee or research responsibilities is 6 per year (usually 3 Fall, 3 Spring, what we call a 3/3 load). My university caps each adjunct at only 3 courses per year; if we want to teach more, we have to find other universities to work at.

The head of my department recently decided that adjuncts would no longer be given preference in hiring for full time positions, so being able to use the job as a bridge to a full time teaching career is no longer an option. The department also recently hired so many new adjuncts that it's now difficult for us to even get 3 courses a year and most are going to be limited to a 1/1 load.

We're going to soon be renegotiating our contract with the university, and the university has been adamant about not increasing our salaries (we do get pay bumps, but it's equivalent to a 2% raise, so basically just matches inflation).

Technically, we're not allowed to strike under our current contract. But, the contract says absolutely nothing about what our actual teaching responsibilities are. If the university is unwilling to budge on pay, then we're looking at putting our job expectations on the table. Here's what it would look like:

If a normal work week is 40 hours, and a normal full time load for a semester is 3 courses, then each course is roughly 13:20 per week. Based on our low pay rate though, the university is entitled to only half that: 6 hours, 50 minutes per week per course. Keep in mind that 2:30 of that is already classroom time, with some extra going to getting to class a bit early to set up, and staying late a few minutes to talk to students. That leaves about 4 hours left for office hours, lesson planning, answering student e-mails, writing assignments, grading papers, etc. There's also often faculty meetings which will take up about 1:30 every few weeks.

I teach a small, writing intensive class with about 20 students. If I want to return essays in a timely manner (we're urged to do it within 1 week), I can spend a full 12 minutes on each individual essay, and that's if I do *nothing* but grade outside of class (no lesson planning, nothing). Normally an 8-10 page paper will take me about 45 minutes to grade, and 10-12 takes about an hour. But, if the university refuses to purchase that service, they may pay for my 12 minute essay analysis which consists of a quick read of the paper, marking any obvious grammatical errors, circling the relevant sections on the grading rubric, and writing a sentence or two in response. This is the course where we're supposed to be teaching you how to write academic essays, and I have to seriously consider eliminating essay writing from my curriculum.

Since we can't strike, our alternative is to provide a bare minimum education.

If you're a student, this should piss you off quite a bit. My university charges about $1,400 per credit hour, so each student is paying $4,200 to be there, and combined the class has a sticker price of $84,000. I see about 5% of that. Realistically, after scholarships, my students are maybe paying $50,000 total, but I still get less than 10% of that.

The sad truth is that you do *not* get what you pay for. You pay the university, and the you get what the university pays for, and the university is a cheap bastard. In order for the situation to get better for adjuncts, we're going to need students to be much more aware of how little of their tuition goes to pay for their education. Also your parents (they're really the university's target audience).

Now just to head off a couple responses I know this is likely to draw:

""If you don't like it, why not just work somewhere else?"" Because I want to teach college students. Getting a job teaching, any job teaching, including shitty adjunct ones, is tough. But that aside, *someone* has to teach the class, and if it's not me, it'll be someone else in the exact same situation. Changing the personnel doesn't change the conditions.

""Why are you taking it out on the students?"" I'm not. I have a menu of services I offer, and the university may decide which they are willing to pay for. It's the university deciding to only pay for a bare bones education while charging top dollar. ...Also, I'm completely willing to take a couple picnic blankets out to the quad to hold lessons and give feedback on essays there on my own time. I'm just going to make sure everyone is crystal clear on what education the university is providing and what education I am providing beyond that.",college,I'm an Adjunct Professor and We're Preparing to Go on Strike,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cf8s7p/im_an_adjunct_professor_and_were_preparing_to_go/,1563567366.0

They told me to ""get involved"" and at this point I'm not sure what else I can do!

I was really hoping I would receive some little bit of aid this semester, but I just received the email saying I wasn't chosen, again.

edit: biotechnology was another option I was looking at, but again my interests lie in aging/developmental research. so while it looks like a bachelors is good to get you into most places, it looks to be something that's better to have a masters in to stay in research &amp; lab. so, back to school later for physics probably isn't an option.

Next month I turn 33. I was blindsided two weeks ago that an old service-connected injury requires surgery that will completely end my ability to continue my current career working as an aircraft maintainer. While I'm in shock, I am okay with that. I was never a fan of the job anyways and kind of just settled. What I'm not okay with is the fact that I have no other credentials to fall back on. I do have my GI bill though, which I have never touched.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, I found out the night of the M7.1 quake in CA, of which I live within the epicenter due to work, that my VA claim had finally gone through. The VA awarded me 100% total and permanent disability, and 16 months worth of back-pay. I felt it important to note, my finances are secure. With the addition of the GI bill, I have the ability to pretty much go anywhere the GI bill is good for school pending acceptance of course.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the school stuff. I'm afraid of being a student. Hell, I don't know where to start with the application process let alone research. I've tried to do some research in the past, but it fell apart quick when I started making phone calls. I've seen many folks throw away their GI bill money on for profit universities just to get the housing allowance. Then they keep on keeping on with contracting. I really do want to try to get the most out of my GI bill and school, even if it means pushing myself. Still, I have some concerns:

&amp;#x200B;

* I suffer cognitive and mental impairment. PTSD, Anxiety and TBI. These represent serious hurdles at times when it comes to learning, communicating and processing information.

&amp;#x200B;

* I had poor high school grades and worse attendance. I was a troubled student, I tested extremely high and I held a D average. I tested out ( California Equivalency) my junior year.

&amp;#x200B;

* I never took the SAT. My past ability to retain and recall information was just insane. It carried me through every test I ever took in life. Today I lose track of days of the week and have trouble keeping track of when I last took my medication. If I have to take the SAT, I will bomb it.

&amp;#x200B;

* I am not sure if I am a transfer student. I started college in the 7th grade. I can't remember how many semesters I attended, but I took several classes each semester. I want to say at least 3 semesters, if not longer. There was no master plan though, there was some general electives but most classes were music. I want to say my GPA was nearly perfect. Ironic given my high school record.

&amp;#x200B;

* I acquired other credits from other schools. Random credits from random schools, including my military ACE (American Council on Education) transcriptions which are supposed to represent some transferable credit that varies by institution, program and individual basis I believe. I don't think I ever got a letter grade less than an A in any of those classes, but I doubt it matters.

&amp;#x200B;

* I need help with applications. This circles back to cognitive and mental impairment. The last time I made an attempt at research and applications, I was trying to contact various veteran liaisons but instead I was met with dead numbers, dead website links, cold shoulders, and in a few instances sheer contempt over the phone. It was frustrating and ultimately I gave up.  


Finally, I'm still not even sure what I want to pursue. My background includes aircraft electrical mechanic, heavy pc and electronic troubleshooting, repair and light mod. The obvious things that pop given my background include computer and electrical engineering, other programs I've been looking into include computer science and cyber security.

So I've been in college since 2015 and right after high school I went to community college for two years. getting some basics out of the way. then I transferred to a 4year school. I didn't do so well at the 4 year and I got suspended so I went back to community college different one this time and have been there for a year but I still haven't been doing so well. Not motivated. I have about 40 or 50 hrs in my undergrad but that seems like it's taking forever and I just want to move on to my major at this point.  Been working on undergrad for almost 4 years. 

my parents want me to move home because they're tired for paying for me to live up here when I just keep failing classes and not getting anywhere. I don't want to leave because it would mean then end of my whole life that I've built up away from my parents. Friends,girlfriend, I finally feel free away from my parents and am dreading moving home/ leaving everything behind. Plus on top of this I haven't been able to find work and so my parents have had to pay for housing and food and everything while I've been up here and it's breaking them and they are tired of it. And financially they're ready for me to move home because I'm not doing good in school and I can't find work and things aren't going good on my own even though I love and it want to continue to be on my own. 

What could be a recommended course of action to take here? talking to a councilor is my best option and I need to do that just procrastonating but I don't think transferring schools is a good idea because I've already done it so many times and lost alot of credits. I am just ready to finish my degree but I don't even have an associates of computer science and I want to get my bachelor's 22 btw. Just that's what my parents want me to do so I can be at home.  I could move in with my girlfriend to reduce housing costs I'd pay her rent with job currently work at Domino's  and pay for everything else as I can. Food,gas and whatnot.

Right now I'm taking 3 classes, one of which is a sexist professor I really don't care for, and am signed up for 3 more during the second summer semester. The thing about DE (Deul Enrollment) at my school is that you can't have anything below a B in order to stay in it and if you do get below a B you're automatically pulled from all of your college classes and can't take anymore for an entire semester until you pay for and pass whichever classes you've ""failed"".

Here's where my issue comes in. My professor, the sexist one, teaches American History. Not a problem since watching the History channel as a kid was how I bonded with my dad when he was home from being on the road for months on end (truck driver for a marketing company), and that I've taken the subject at least 6 times and passed. My issue with this professor is that he is so utterly incompetent, always unprepared and is the worst kind of sexist one can be; the low-key kind.

Now you're probably wondering why I'm having a mini panic attack at 11:30 at night. See my professor, being the ever helpful man he is, said that the final exam would be online just like the last few exams and that we didn't need to come in for the next 2 classes. So I go online the day the test is due to take it, search for the exam, fail to find it, look at the gradebook to see if I should be panicking and see that there is no line for the final exam. 

So that, to me at least, made me conclude that the last test we took WAS the final exam. Bam, problem solved right? Nope. 

Now here I am, 3 days AFTER final grades have been put in with a 60-something in that class. Mind you he had every other assignment already in the gradebook to be graded and even said the first day of class that everything that was going to be graded was online waiting to be graded.

I have no idea what to do. DE is basically my only option of getting a college education. I was planning on cramming in 11 college classes when my senior year of high school starts up in the fall and my parents can't afford to spend $1,000+ to retake a class so that I can MAYBE take 11 the semester after, putting me 2 semesters behind my plan.",college,I'm Having A Mini Panic Attack Right Now,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/c35oak/im_having_a_mini_panic_attack_right_now/,1561106687.0

418,rolenoakenbow,1561018392,/r/college/comments/c2tcos/i_dont_want_to_study_engineering_but_feel/," Let me start this off with some contextualization. I come from a heavily conservative Indian family, which means that while growing up, my parents have constantly been telling me that I need to study either medicine or engineering. From the moment I hit middle school, I faced a constant bombardment of IIT-JEE prep courses and general railroading towards the engineering world, especially as both of my parents are computer engineers. The catch? I've never been even remotely interested in medicine or engineering. From a young age, I've excelled at debate, which honed my research skills, analytical thinking, and policy exposure. I've always known that I wanted to do something along those lines, but growing up in South India, that was always out of the question.  


After my sophomore year of high school, we moved to the US, and boy did it hit me like a breath of fresh air. I was introduced to a land of endless possibilities, and families that were supportive of their children no matter what field of study they entered. I was enamored, and began to think that maybe I may have a chance to study what I wanted. So one day my junior year I summoned enough courage and told my parents I wanted to study government, with a focus on environmental policy.  


I was ridiculed and branded delusional for even bringing up such ideas. Liberal arts are for white kids, they said. What's this about you not liking math? That's not acceptable. Stop debating and focus on your studies.  


When I began applying to college, I had the chance to apply to some very prestigious universities. My grades were great, I'd gotten 5s on all my liberal arts AP tests (think APUSH, AP Gov, AP Lang etc), and I had the extracurriculars to back me up. The moment I brought my idea to my father though, I was immediately shot down. ""If you want to study government, pay for it yourself,"" I was told. Things got to a head when he refused to pay my application fee unless I applied as a prospective mechanical engineering student. At the time, I was financially dependent on my parents for everything, and had little sense of independence. I put my head down, allowed myself to be bullied into submission, and said okay. Maybe engineering wouldn't be so bad, I told myself. Maybe I could study environmental engineering, and it would somewhat align with the goals I had envisaged for myself.  


My first year of college has been miserable. I managed to BS my way into a top engineering college on the East Coast, and I am struggling like I never have before. My grades have tanked because I am way out of my depth. Competing against kids who have studied multivariable calculus since the tenth grade and who are there because they want to be is both incredibly challenging and incredibly demoralizing. I feel like a fraud, and like there's nothing I can do in my situation.  


To make matters worse, my university is divided into individual colleges. To feasibly transfer into my university's College of Arts and Sciences (to study gov), I'd have to submit a formal transfer request, for which I have nowhere near the required GPA. My grades are in the dirt, and I've been placed on academic probation because I'm just not able to keep up academically. I'm lost, demotivated, and in a rut.  


I can't bring this up to my parents, because when I do, they give me the same stock responses, every time. ""Engineering is hard for everyone. This nonsense about government is just an escapist fantasy."" ""You're an arrogant, ungrateful child who can't appreciate the sacrifices we've made for you."" ""If you're too stupid for engineering, there are always minimum wage jobs looking to hire."" I cannot tell them that I have been depressed for the past three years, that I am absolutely miserable watching my friends live out their dreams elsewhere, that I feel guilty because maybe I am being ungrateful and throwing away a shot others would kill to have. But I don't know what else to do.  


I really want to study government, and I really want to work in the public sector dealing with environmental policy in the future. I'm not a bad student, either. I had straight As in high school, and got really high grades in my writing and singular environmental policy class in college. I'm passionate about the environment, about political theory and analysis, and about civic engagement. I've recently been looking at withdrawing from the College of Engineering and reapplying to my university's College of Arts and Sciences, but I'm terrified that my low GPA disqualifies me from consideration. I've been looking at external academic forgiveness program at other universities, but I'm afraid my parents will cut me off financially and I won't be able to afford college anymore.  


I'm terrified, you guys. What do I do?

In Colombia when you finish your senior year of high school you must do a standardized test, the score you get is the only thing that matters to get into university.  Universities and the government give out scholarships to students that do well. But some people can't get into the university of their dreams or even the degree that they want to pursue if they don't get a high enough score (rated on an average)   
This is a 400ish questions, 8-hours long, multiple choice test that grades math, chemistry, biology, physics, english, reading comprehension and sociocultural/historical knowledge and ability to infer.   
Schools prepare students for this test by teaching over and over again the same basic concepts that are graded in this test, schools are ranked by the average their senior classes get each year and public schools get more funding if they do better than private schools, this means some public schools one and only focus is this test and they only prepare students on how to do this test .  


For all of my academic life I was a mediocre student, never did any homework or made an effort to do better than the minimum, in school I used to pass each year with a 90ish% grade-average because of how well I did on finals and quizzes because I retain knowledge and comprehend stuff easily. I never once studied, I didn't need to. I had classmates who played sports, represented the school in Model United Nations, were part of the student council and handed every single homework and studied for a whole month before each big exam. One of these classmates, let's call her R, was the best student in the class, always had the best grades, she always had extracurricular activities and she was class representative every single year.  
R prepared for this test by the classes given by our school, and extra classes that she paid for every afternoon and every weekend for two years, she never did good under stress, because of her stress-handling issues she got a bad score in the probably most important test of her life and couldn't get into med school. In the other hand, I was the student who always slept in class and was always free to hang out during the afternoons because I never gave any importance to school. I had one of the best scores in the region and I got my whole degree &gt;!

423,beabg,1559342793,/r/college/comments/bvdz8h/nontraditional_unis_similar_to_minerva/,"Hi everyone!

I'm 17 (f) and graduated a couple of months ago (a year and a half early) so I will be attending my local state school for a year since my parents and I agreed I should take this year to ""test the waters"" (since technically it was supposed to be my senior year) and stay home. The university gave me a Presidential Scholarship and entrance to the Honors Program, so I'm paying 7K for the year. However, I cannot see myself staying there for four years, it's traditional in every sense and none of the ideas or systems it represents excite me. I've grown up in a very non-traditional educational background (both from moving around and the ideas both my parents hold) so I'd say my view on how one should learn and the way the whole US uni system works is different from many others. Of course, I will do my best this next year but I am pretty sure I will want to transfer somewhere else after the year. 

&amp;#x200B;

I found out about Minerva Schools at KGI a while back and have been very interested in its ideology and approach to education, which aligns more with how I've grown up and how I want to continue as a person. I will be applying but don't want to rely just on that because 1) they seem to be very selective and 2) my financial situation isn't the best, my dad's income is too high to get any aid but they cannot pay more than about 10K (health issues he pays for and so on, my current uni gave me $0 in aid I just got merit awards). I've been trying to look into unis with similar ideologies like Minerva, which don't adhere to the traditional and (imo) ineffective system of many universities. Also, travel is a very important element for me as I've grown up moving around different countries and I also want to incorporate that in my future. Any other universities which might interest someone who loves the idea of Minerva?? I know there is nothing exactly like it but I really am hoping to find an innovative atmosphere where I'll receive a global immersion rather than be stuck for four years. I want to get hands-on experience and learn things I can't just go online for since nowadays that's so easy. Finances are also a big issue because I don't want to be in debt for life and already know I can't qualify for much aid, so hopefully, something which is on the cheaper side (for American standards at least).

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for this post being so vague but I mostly just want to see people's thoughts/advice for someone in my position, or any universities that you think would be a good fit. I've given this so much thought and have already compiled a list of possible unis and other programs (I won't post on here bc it's unnecessary) but thought I'd go on here to get some more input and hopefully options I haven't heard/read about already.  The field I'm going into is more social sciences/humanities based just for extra info, and I do not care about the school having an established sports team or anything like that. I'll add that my resume is pretty established as I've already held internships/jobs and my grades are high, but I don't want to rely on just highly selective places.

I did get an acceptance to an internship this coming fall, but that fell through because their time commitment was too harsh (9 hours a day, 3 days a week) and it would have cost me $50 each way to get to the job site. There seemed to be no negotiating with them on this, they did not understand that I was a full time student..


So now I'm back to scouting. I've pretty much emailed and called Congressional offices to see what luck I can have there. I looked over my cover letter for a think-tank I got rejected from for the summer that I'm going to apply to in the fall... but otherwise I really have zero idea where I can go around DC that will qualify for a politics degree. Personally, I'd love to be doing something with East Asia or the Middle East, or startups, but if that can't be put into place for whatever reason fine I'll do something I might not like for three-four months to get my degree knocked out.


My school is no help. Whatsoever. They refuse to present you with internship offers, only places where people have interned/are interning. To pay as much as I am for this education that feels like a slap in the face, and my parents are only now realizing ""hey wait they actually *aren't* helping you out...""


Besides Congressional offices, local campaigns, think tanks... where can I go? Do lobbying firms offer internships? Smithsonian museums? I'm really at a loss, and because my university degree necessitates a 3 credit internship and (according to my parents) I **must** get my degree on time, I'm at a loss. Realistically, if I don't graduate in the spring of my senior year I can't stay in the area due to cost of living, so I don't know what I'll do. I just have to find something that works, wont cost $100 a day in Uber fees, and qualifies for a politics related internship...

426,JustADuDuDude,1559005746,/r/college/comments/btttxt/should_i_give_up_on_doing_anything_with_my/,"As a kid (like about 5 years old), drawing was my favorite thing in the world. Whenever someone asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, without fail, I'd always say, ""I wanna be an artist!"" And there was a lot of advice given by the people around me...""follow your heart!""...""do what you love!""...""enjoy what you do and money will follow!"" 

Fast forward to now, 17 years old in high school, and I still love drawing as much as I did back then. However, I've discovered that unless you're like an absolute 1 in a million prodigy, you can't really get a good job as an artist. You barely make any more than minimum wage, your hours are long and unforgiving, and you have to work about 20x harder than people who aren't necessarily doing what they love but that makes good money. They get to live a comfortable life while you pinch pennies just to pay for your basic needs. 

But it's all good...I have some new passions on the side. 

I discovered I liked writing when I was around 13. I like it even more than drawing, actually. But guess what? It also makes shit money unless you're an absolute prodigy. 

But wait, there's also some back-up passions...I really enjoy learning about psychology, and I've loved singing as well ever since I began taking choir in school. 

But guess what? Those also pay shit money unless you're an absolute prodigy.

What do I do? Back out of those passions and find other things...even though I won't be doing what I love, at least I'll get paid well, right? 

But I'm just so bad at anything math or history related, and I suck at most sciences too, except for psychology...

I haven't tried computer programming yet...last chance I have, I guess...

**TL;DR- My main passion is writing. My secondary passion would be drawing. And my back-up passions would be psychology and singing. But NONE of those pay very well at all.

Did pretty well academically, finished with a 3.8 cumulative gpa doing an honors dual degree in Finance and Econ, and continued to work my part time job from high school so I can pay the small balance not covered by scholarships and save some too. If I stay here for the next three years, I will graduate with zero debt, money in the bank, and two honors degrees in Econ and finance.

My only real concern is my social life. I really struggled to make actual friends this year. Sure, I talked with people in my classes casually, but I never spent much time outside of class with anyone other than myself. I've never been good at putting myself out there, and kept a pretty close group of friends from elementary school until graduating high school. All of my close childhood friends go to the state university that is about 2.5 hours from my home, and they are really encouraging me to transfer there, and I constantly hear them talk about how much fun dorming, partying, and the ""College Experience"" is. In order for me to go there for the next three years, I would need roughly 40-50k in total loans, as my parents can't cover it all.

My situation is somewhat complicated because 1. I live with my parents 2. They pay for my tuition.

This is my third year of college, and up until this point I've always skated along and never had any issues with keeping my grades up. I'd say I'm maybe a B average student, never getting lower than a C, or whatever the minimum necessary requirements are.

However, this semester was just peppered with mishaps and failings and despite considering myself to be someone of great mental and emotional fortitude, I just felt buried under the weight of fallout from ending a 2+ year long relationship (months worth of cheating came to light), my uncle and my grandfather dying two weeks apart from each other, learning that my best friend is suicidal, and more. I just like, mentally gave up, and I couldn't stop myself. It was like watching the semester self-destruct in slow motion.

This semester, I may be failing a class, getting a D in another, and potentially not getting the C+ I need to fulfill the prerequisite for a course next semester.

The class I'm failing I suppose I can do course forgiveness for next semester, so that's not really a big deal. But the D is probably unavoidable, and it's not being offered again so I can't do course forgiveness. I'm not sure it would be worth the effort to do course forgiveness anyways, but it still kind of sucks to have factored into your GPA.

The C+ I really need. It's for a language, and each level has 2 classes, one offered in the fall, and one in the spring. Not getting the grade I need would put me drastically out of order, unless I could potentially find a makeup class at a local community college or something.

I'm a Marketing major and I registered for a Maymester Marketing course which starts on May 20th, but I spoke to a lady in FAFSA about how it'll be covered and she told me that due to Federal Law, FAFSA won't be dispursed until June 3rd. She informed me that the school is aware of that, and that they will still let me take the course. HOWEVER, she told me that IF the federal loan doesn't come in on time, then I'm responsible for paying that tuition on June 3rd by 5PM out of my own pocket, and then I'll be reimbursed later on when the loan comes in. If for some reason the loan doesn't come in on time and I don't pay it (Which I definitely can't afford), then I'll be dropped from all of my other summer courses that start on June &amp; July and will get a hold on my final grade for the Maymester. 

This is really frustrating for me, because I've never taken a Maymester course before and I'm worried the worst will happen. But then again everything could go smoothly as well. 

I do have another option though.. I can take an Investment class that starts in June, but it's pretty unrelavent to Marketing which is my major, and plus the class doesn't start till 5:30PM so I'll have a 4 hour break..

I'm 21 and just now starting community college this fall to get my Gen-Ed classes out of the way, and then transferring to a 4-year. I'm planning on doing all of my classes online, but am curious what others think. I struggled *majorly* during high school. I get distracted fairly easily by anxiety/paranoia (something I've worked on and fixed a lot since then), and I tend to learn and retain information much better and faster when I teach myself things, rather than listening to a teacher (plus, I learn from reading/writing things out and speaking things out loud to myself, and I tend to space out or get distracted by every little thing from lectures). 

Anyways, I visited the community college yesterday to take some placement tests (I hadn't actually been inside the campus buildings before), and noticed how extremely loud and obnoxious everything seemed. It looked, felt, and sounded just like high school. Of course, being a CC, the classes are super small, and I was never able to do well in confined classes where I know the teacher is trying to get me to pay attention to their lecture, while I'm trying to read over the study guides or teach myself the lesson. Also, I was encouraged to enroll in an Honors English course, but found out you can't do it online, but only in person.

So, with all that (probably unnecessary) info, since I'll only be getting my Gen-Ed's, would it be a mistake to take all my classes online? Do you think I would be better suited for online or in-person classes based on my learning style? And have you ever taken any online classes? How were they?

Not to brag, but just so you get an idea, I was accepted to study at Oxford University next year (just though study abroad but still quite competitive).

Yet I feel like that just makes me all the more of a fuck up. I am extremely, extremely behind-- basically failing -- in all my classes and life. Failing, as in, despite all the generous extensions I've received, I still have three weeks to complete basically an entire semester's worth of work. 

That's the biggest issue but on top of this I haven't been taking my antidepressants for a week or so because I just forgot and then I just kept not taking them I don't even know why? And because I'm procrastinating with money stuff and can't find the energy to walk to bank and then the pharmacy I've been going without my ADHD meds for a couple days and using caffeine to compensate. I have missed so many doctor's appointments that I needed to go to. I am also, I believe, a bit of a kleptomaniac (or maybe I'm just a conscience-less asshole) and stole some small things like lipstick from my best friend (she knows we chatted about it and she forgave me) but I recently did it again and she found it and somehow forgave me but I still feel like shit and don't feel like I deserve or can reciprocate her friendship. And I've stolen other things, like clothes lying around campus, foreign money I found in a purse in the lost and found and even books from the library because my account is frozen from lost items and I guess I have no conscience about stealing old books no one reads anyways (except I do feel bad after the fact, sorta..) it's going to catch up with me and I don't even need things!!!! I'm a disaster human and for a long time know one knew but now I feel like my mask isn't slipping and the shame is unbearable.

I owe money to a bunch of different places and people and have an overdue rental laptop I'm too afraid to return because of how late it is. I have it and don't need it but the thought of facing them, after how many emails and calls they've made, and sheepishly being like ""here it is"" makes me want to die. I literally want someone to return it for me! This is so ducking stupid. I also have an overdue tab from on campus cafe from last year! They've been pestering me to pay it (it's like $50 dollars) for like a year but I never have the money and hate asking my parents for help.

To make matters much worse I lost my debit card a over month ago and am too scared now to call and get a new one because what even do I say? I lost this A MONTH AGO? I never even told them to freeze it (the account was zero anyways so I thought it didn't matter). I'm also procrastinating on that because I'd to tell my mom (they have to ship out first to her address) and that is always so shame inducing and stressful.

More ways I'm a fuck up: I haven't recorded the hours I've worked. Partially because I'm too forgetful and/or lazy and embarrassed to ask my boss for retro hours. I desperately need the money, though, and have been selling my clothes to get money to pay for things/bills. I also haven't bothered with it because it goes directly into my credit card which, as you know, I lost a month ago and haven't dealt with. And the class dean keeps calling me because I'm sure my professors have been emailing her (it's a small school where profs notice and care about students, another reason I feel so guilty for letting them down). And of course I am avoiding the dean too because the idea of visiting someone who know how badly I've fucked up scares the shit out of me. I just want to get my shit together a little before I talk to her bt I've been saying that for a month. Any progress I make is so minimal. Like I seem to take three days to just ORGANIZE my planner. Or get everything together and make the calls so I can walk to go and get my ADHD meds? That takes a whole damn day. Not kidding. Now imagine a 7 page paper? Well, two days needed to get everything ready: find the money to buy caffeine pills so I can actually have energy to write, figure out how to steal appropriate library books, ask friend to meet me somewhere to give me the assignment because I lost it and deleted the email on accident, borrow/rent a laptop because I don't own one, walk to library only find out it it closed on the weekends, try to work in dorm but it's too loud, explain to your friends and boyfriend why you never have time to hang out, try to figure out what to write about, have a meltdown, write reddit post because of meltdown, etc etc. Then the writing stage starts and I am writing a the speed of a snail. My eyes hurt and I need a break after spending three hours on a couple sentences, having scoured the thesaurus because none of the words work...

I feel so guilty for throwing away this opportunity, again, especially when so many people are trying to help me. This has happened before too. It's not like I'm a first year. I'm a junior! I feel like I'm letting everyone down again and again. And I want so bad to make them respect me and be prof of me so when I'm talking to them, especially my favorite professor, who honestly loves me because we are just really close and I'm super enthusiastic and smart in his subject. I know he must be getting sick of my excuses/lies, though. I always make promises about turning in stuff that I know I can't keep, just to make him happy and not annoyed and mad in the moment. Like I just say what people want to hear instead of the truth. And then I let them down and feel horrible. And no one trusts me and they shouldn't because I am the least trustworthy and honest person alive and I want to stay in bed and avoid everyone forever.

The worst part is the shame and avoidance and web of lies I've spun. I don't even know how many people I have been lying to so many people I can't keep track.

I probably haven't even mentioned half of the ways I've fucked up lately. This feels like beyond ADHD. It feels like madness. And the lying and hiding and avoiding is about to backfire real hard. I've been daydreaming about suicide to be honest.

It would have helped probably but I can't even make my appointments I'm too lazy. That and the fact that's when I start to talk about that stuff it consumes every waking thought and I need to get work done. I'm a very good student sometimes, like I win awards for research and stuff, so my professors have been very understanding. But that can only go so far. I have to turn something in eventually and my brain just feels broken. It can't do anything. But I always feel like this and it has happened again and again and I never seem to improve so how can anyone trust or respect me?

My mom is going to be so mad at me. I will have to stop lying and tell her everything about school. And she will be upset and yell at me, which is normal and expected, but it will be so hard to listen to go on and on and on with the yelling and lecturing me about how hard I make HER life without just shouting at her that I was fucking molested by my dad and never told her, and never will, because I know it will ruin her life!

But at the end of the day it all comes down to me. I'm a liar. And lazy. And cannot be trusted. It will take a lot of work to gain back the respect of everyone.

437,mothking,1556245973,/r/college/comments/bhh6vy/this_is_a_bit_ranty_im_growing_more_disinterested/,"(I'm not sure if this belongs in dropping courses megathread, but I'm talking about dropping college entirely, so idk)

Also prefacing: If you can't handle long, angsty monologuing then might want to stop reading. And I probably overthink things. I know, this is a long read, sorry. I just don't want to make the wrong decision, I think it's a pretty big one that could really fuck me up if I make the wrong move. Also note, I'm a little oblivious when it comes to the real world, and I might be too presumptuous about a few things, including that I can even get a job in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

In highschool I was super interested in wildlife biology (well, still am), but I'm starting to grow more on the idea of just dropping out college to go straight into work. Just about anywhere as long as it's not fast food or retail (I know some people who have jobs that sound really cool to me actually, and they don't have degrees, so I know it's not impossible). 

&amp;#x200B;

So here are some of my selling points (or maybe just me trying to convince myself):

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like college right now, is a PRISON to me. It's the only thing on my mind. I can't do ANYTHING without becoming anxious thinking about it. It's making me depressed and feeling like absolute horseshit.

&amp;#x200B;

The line of work I want to go in for my degree hardly makes jack shit money on average to begin with &amp; there's huge competition in finding jobs. I would probably make more or less the same money with my degree than without one, basing it on average salaries. 

&amp;#x200B;

I live pretty quaintly and can figure out how to make things work on a low income, I'm smart enough not to just spend it all on pointless shit. I do my research. I never party, I'm antisocial so no eating out fancy, bars, clubbing, etc. Couldn't care less about that stuff. I help my grandpa with his vegetable farm which has a ton of food, much of which he lets me have for free. I know solutions to cheap, healthy food, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

(This ones a big one for me) I really hate the idea of wasting minimum 6 years (including grad school, which I basically NEED if I want to find a job in my related field) of my relatively young life on something that stresses me and gives me anxiety to no end, even when I'm not there. I'd be much more comfortable just having a simple routine of work, it seems MUCH less chaotic &amp; stressful and more stable than college life (Correct me if you disagree with that statement...). I know some people who live the kind of lifestyle I'm thinking of and they seem to be doing pretty well as far as I can tell, they never seem stressed out about work and stuff, and they don't seem to be scraping the bottom of barrels for food scraps. Anecdotal, I know, but still gives me peace of mind.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a brother and we agreed to find a place together (if things work out and we're able to) and split rent, housework, etc. A roommate, you know.

&amp;#x200B;

I have relative connections. A lot of my relatives have good jobs, and also know lots of people who have good jobs/work. I could probably get a job through that way if I needed too. They're very friendly people with me, I'm sure they would help me if I really needed it. It's how both of my brothers got jobs at one point.

&amp;#x200B;

I create digital art, and have been asked to open commissions from some of my followers. I haven't done it yet, but plan to in the future. I could make some extra money doing that. Also I could also do dog sitting/walking (can't bring myself to do babysitting, I'm bad around children) for some extra cash. I'd probably enjoy it, too.

&amp;#x200B;

That's my reasoning. Some things I'm worried about however:

&amp;#x200B;

Can I support a dog? Even if I myself live cheap and quaintly enough, will I have the spare money to care for a dog's food costs and vet bills? 

&amp;#x200B;

Might seem silly but can I afford to play video games &amp; use the internet? I don't expect a lot of spare time, not as much as I have now, but can I afford good internet and stuff? (Of course, it's not my top priority or #1 concern)

&amp;#x200B;

Can I get a decent house? I'm perfectly happy with a small, simple house. The more rural, the better. Not a fan of urban areas, or even the more dense suburbs. I currently live in a moderately small suburb area, and it's pretty nice here. As long as I don't live in a shitty ghetto neighborhood I'd be OK (like, the ones you hear constant gunshots in, trash literally flooding the streets, and all the houses look like they just got through a tornado. Being in this shithole that is Louisiana, I've been through those kinds of streets before and all I have to say is: No thank you).

&amp;#x200B;

Strange question, but realistically, without a degree, how hard is it to GET a stable job and KEEP it? I don't want to get fired simply because they no longer need me there. And will I be able to get promotions? I've never had a ""real"" job before. School/class has always been my full-time ""job,"" usually. My parents used to tell me not to worry about getting a job and just focus on my classes for now. Kind of wish I didn't follow that advice. I do not know why they told me that. I've done work for pay, but I'm only talking about one-time job scenarios, no longer than a full week.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I'm just too lazy, and I'm probably just trying to delude myself into thinking of the ""I'm not cut out for it"" thing. I do consider myself an academically smart person, but I just don't like putting in the effort, perhaps. The thought makes me resent myself, but I can't help it. I'm probably just a shit person.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? I'm really just trying to reason with myself here and it feels like I'm wrestling in my own head. So damn stressed over this.

I wanted to drop it because it was an entry level nursing-type class that required multiple page essays due every class that, I realized nursing wasn't for me, conflicted with the time I needed to spend working on my other classes. It was my only elective class at the time. I'd gone to his office, during his office hours and kindly asked to drop his class, he wasn't happy about it to say the least, I walked away and out of his office just for him to follow me out and push me from behind, I yelled at him over it and another professor came from his office and took the professors side on it even though my friend was there with me and witnessed the whole thing. I didn't come back to school that semester after this. 

The second semester, I had to reapply and went on academic probation for the semester before. I was doing really good until I lost my car because I couldn't afford the payments/insurance on it. I started taking the bus, no big deal. But, then my mother needed me, because I was the only available adult at the time, to get my brother off the school bus at a certain hour. This conflicted entirely with my schedule at school and I ended up not being able to attend anymore because I had real world responsibilities I had to manage. I ended up going back to a regular job and doing what was needed of me at home. 

My question is, how will all of this affect me going back to school again? I know I've failed numerous classes and passed very few. I want to try and take online courses whenever I do go back so that I can finally get something more than factory jobs. I can't imagine that fafsa will take me back off the bat and I may need to pay out of pocket for a semester or two. Will they ever take me back and let me use fafsa again? I no longer have the responsibilities to my mother as we no longer live together. I still don't have a car because I was indebted because I returned the other one year's ago and somehow still had to pay for it anyway, that debts finally gone. 

I'm 24 and just worried that I've ruined my life and any help or guidance would be very much appreciated. I plan to take my classes slowly if I end up going back and (hopefully) doing most online.

However, he insists that he cannot help me pay for college, so I've been working through community college, at one point working two jobs while taking classes full time, and until I moved out recently I was paying my parents rent on top of all of that. 

Now my stepfather has some- ahem- expensive tastes that have resulted in a lot of credit card debt. My mom (who does not have a degree) has been working nonstop to help pay bills, and the last time I asked her if they can help at all with college, she broke down crying and said that if she could give me money out of her own income, she would, but because of bills they are living paycheck to paycheck. My stepdad does not like talking about money and typically sends my mom to talk to me about anything sensitive, so I am not sure how he would react if I were to talk to him one-on-one about my college expenses.

Now I'm getting ready to transfer to a four-year university, and again, I'm getting zero financial aid and no help from my parents. I am planning on having the conversation with them. Once I find out if I receive any scholarships, I plan to make a sheet listing expenses, and then listing out all the scholarships and money that I have saved up, and then highlight the amount leftover in red. I'll bring this sheet to both my mom and my stepdad at the dinner table and tell them that I need their help paying the remaining balance. 

Would any of you have any advice for this conversation?

I live in Alabama and so I accepted my fate and went to a CC and agreed to a joint admission program to our local state college UAB(University of Alabama at Birmingham). With that being said, I forgot that it mean't most of the credits were approved by that school the most. It wasn't until recently in my sophomore year that I fell in love with NY and made a group a friends instantly- something I haven't been able to do now. I haven't been happy living here after I  had to move back due to personal reasons. I haven't talked with any admissions people at the colleges I thought about applying to and did most of my research online, so I don't know if they would consider my credits. So far from my research, 7 of courses aren't recognized by many of the schools I thought about applying to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not well monied:

1) If the admissions people don't accept my courses, I'd have to take the classes all over again, if I chose to move. 

2) If I move, I'll have to pay for out of state tuition which is triple the amount for in state students. Plus trying to live in an apartment and work, I'm not sure. 

3) The school I'd attend in state is at least $11,910 after the fall and spring semester of one year. 

&amp;#x200B;

NY consequences if I go:

1) I'm worried that I won't find a job.

2)worried I won't find a job and end up moving back home.

3) Worried that i might end up taking recover classes because my credits weren't covered. 

4) take a break from school just to save for school the next few semesters. so I wouldn't be able to go up in higher edu unless part of my debt is paid off. 

&amp;#x200B;

My academic plan:

1) go for computer science 

2) get internships for computer science

3) find a job with the bachelors degree

4) spend time working and pay off debt while taking up extra curricular activities for med school application(medical examiner). 

5) If i have to take extra needed classes to be a qualified med applicant then I would have no problem doing so.

General scope of my situation: I graduated in 2017, I had a 3.8 gpa, tons of extra curricular activities, etc. I applied for and got into a a big state school (Ohio State) my senior year. I applied for federal aid, but because this was the year they moved filing with FAFSA from January to October, I applied with taxes from 2 years back. During that time my dad had lost his job and our income severely diminished. I still went to college for a semester, and tried to make an EFC appeal but due to my mother's incompetence, she gave me the stuff I needed to do the appeal, after that aid year was over and I could no longer change my EFC. So, I ended up leaving that semester, not being able to enroll the next semester because I owed about 4000$ still. On top of that, my father had 2 heart attacks, and said mother was incarcerated for 2 of those months of that semester. I was stressed to hell and back, and I ended up getting out on academic probation. So, I was put on a leave of absence, and went back home. The past year and a half that I've been home, I've been working a full time job and making payments on my student loans and the money I still owe the college. I'm eager to get back to school, once I pay off my outstanding balance, but here's where I hit a lot of issues; 1.) When I was put on academic probation, my federal aid I did have, was suspended. 2.) Now, I'm fine with not going back to said state school, though I'm not sure how I'd be able to apply at a new college with history at that old one, or even how to apply being a not just graduating senior. 3.) I can't apply for aid, because my parents taxes, haven't been filed since the year I applied with. And since I'm only 20, they force me to account for them. 4.) On top of all of that, my father killed himself only a month ago now, so we lost his income again, so I'd have to file an EFC appeal anyway, right? 5.) Final thing, even if I somehow figured out how to bypass all of that, I now have a single mother who can't contribute to my education, and because of her history as a drug addict, her credit is shit, and couldn't help me get a private loan to cover the rest of that, so I'm really at a loss of what I could do.

As it was, I was giving my paycheck to my mom to help with rent and groceries, etc., so she could heal from some medical issues. We're living out of our savings, so I can't and won't ask my mom for money.

Everything's kind of crashing in at the same time, all while I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to pay for school.

My problem... This has also been the first year I've actually *looked into* my education, and I *hate* project work - which is what engineering becomes full of. I sort of *fell into* engineering, with no serious passion for it. Even the projects we have now, much more basic than the bigger ones in later years, give me anxiety and completely overwhelm me.

I'm actually looking to change courses again, I've applied for Financial Mathematics (I'm obsessed with maths, it's those subjects I'm really thriving at in engineering) in another college. My brother graduated the maths course with a first class honour last year and I'm looking to follow him. I'm by no means guaranteed the course - my Leaving Cert (school) points are 550 (out of 625), which would have got me in in 2018 (543 minimum required) but not 2017 or 2016 (557 and 563 required respectively I believe) so I might have to rely on my Mature Student application (I should have an interview in early May for that).

I've suffered from crippling anxiety issues due to being locked up by my parents when I was a child (I've been a type 1 diabetic my whole life and my mother's fear of the world made her keep me locked up, keeping me from developing like other people my age). As a result I had no autonomy at 18 and only in the past couple of years feel like I've developed into an adult at all. I'm going to (brilliant) counselling at college, talking through my anxiety, depression and suicidal issues. They might even be able to pay for anxiety medication for me (I can't afford it due to college fees and running my car, and can't tell my parents about it to help me as my father would kill me - again, very rough childhood).

I'm extremely jealous of all my friends who are either in their final year or finished college completely, off exploring the world and earning great salaries while I... possibly haven't even started first year yet (I'll stick out Mechanical Engineering if I have to, but I really want to, and should be, studying maths). I'm just so overwhelmed by all the mistakes I feel I've made, and frustrated by the comparative lack of effort I put in to my education (especially compared to the colossal effort I'm putting in now). As I spoke about at counselling, I know it does stem from my childhood of seclusion (as a result, I spend as much time on my own as I can now, seeing my girlfriend once a week or so but isolating myself from the rest of the world due to my anxiety) but I still feel at fault and that really weighs heavily on me and exacerbates my depression.

Is there anyone else in a (somewhat) similar situation to me, either getting in to education late or struggling with the overwhelming nature of it?

454,PhantomDiclonius,1552450973,/r/college/comments/b0hom6/asking_for_feedback_on_going_back_to_school_for_a/," 

Hello everyone, I was hoping to get some feedback regarding my second journey through higher education. I already have a bachelor's in Business Administration; Information Systems from UCR and am thinking about going back to school to follow my original passion for video games. I'm thinking about taking some classes at my local community college and then transferring into a 4-year university that accepts students seeking a second baccalaureates, but I'm unsure of which school and major would be the best path for me. I've come up with four potential schools in my area that accept second baccalaureates: UCI, CSULB, CSUSB, and Cal Poly Pomona.

&amp;#x200B;

Coming from UCR, my top choice would naturally be UCI as I've always been told that the general opinion from employers is that a degree from a UC generally looks better than a degree from a CSU. However, because I already have a bachelor's degree, I plan to not get much financial assistance if any at all, so I was thinking that a CSU might be a better choice in terms of finances, but a UC would be a better choice in terms of networking and finding a job. The other problem that I have with UCI is that they only offer a select few programs for second baccalaureates and the closest program they have to Computer Science is Software Engineering, which I fear wouldn't look the best competitively in the video game industry because the program requires no Physics courses or multivariable calculus which concerns me. I know UCI has a wonderful Game Science Program, but I sadly can't major in it because I'd be going for a second baccalaureate. :(

[http://catalogue.uci.edu/donaldbrenschoolofinformationandcomputersciences/#softwareengr](http://catalogue.uci.edu/donaldbrenschoolofinformationandcomputersciences/#softwareengr)

&amp;#x200B;

The next school on my list would probably be CSULB. Unlike UCI; Nursing, Engineering, Mathematics, Foreign Languages, and Natural Sciences are applicable majors for students seeking a second bachelor's degree. So my plan for CSULB would be to enroll in their Computer Science program which indeed does require Physics but no linear algebra or multivariable calculus. Which again makes me fear that the degree may not look very competitive.

[http://catalog.csulb.edu/preview\_program.php?catoid=2&amp;poid=508](http://catalog.csulb.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=2&amp;poid=508)

&amp;#x200B;

My third choice would be CSUSB. I'm beginning to this that this school may be my best choice because it's the closest school to me. It's only 30 minutes away with no traffic so I was planning on commuting to this school from my parent's house thus saving a tone of money in terms of housing. This school also doesn't seem picky about students seeking a second bachelor's degree and offers two programs that I'm interested in: Computer Science and Game Development.

&amp;#x200B;

The fourth school on my list would be Cal Poly Pomona as a last resort option.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to get some feedback, Would it not be worth it to pay the high price of attending UCI just because it's a UC? A big positive about UCI is the fact that there are some pretty good video game companies in the Irvine area such as SEGA and Blizzard, but I'm not sure if it would be worth taking the financial hit to move out there especially since I probably won't be getting any financial aid from FAFSA. I also wanted to ask, what major would be the best to study in order to help me accomplish my goals of getting into the video game industry? I've heard that having a general computer science degree is better than pursuing a degree in game development because its more flexible and will allow you to get other jobs than just games. But should I be concerned if one program focuses more on Physics and another program focuses more on math? UCI's software engineering program doesn't really focus on either math or physics and is made up of mostly computer classes.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to figure out which school and which program I should pursue now so that I can make sure I take the classes that I need this Summer and not waste time and money on classes that are unnecessary.

At the beginning of February my dad was admitted to hospice care with heart and liver failure, and in the past two weeks his health has practically become non-existent. Growing up I didn't have the closest relationship with him, nothing bad just never had the father-daughter bond that some girls have, but now that I know I'm gonna lose him soon I feel guilty for not being closer to him. Not only emotionally but physically too since he lives all the way across the country, and has for most of my life. I understand that losing a parent is never easy, but I never expected it to effect me this badly. I have no ambition to finish this semester and don't know what to do. Part of me is considering dropping out of this semester just to take some mental health time, but I'm also scared if I do my depression will just get worse. I'm currently taking 15 units (Calc 1, Chemistry, and Computer Programming) and it just feels too heavy while going through something like this...
Some other important information: I'm a non -tradional student who also works around 20 hours a week during the semester in order to pay for rent and other bills, but it helps me to be full time because I receive VA benefits (my dad is retired navy), and that covers a big portion of my income, so if I drop to part time, I'm not receiving as much and just taking away from hours I could be working. I've been going to CC for about 2 years, but still need around 70 units to transfer. I'm not in any hurry to graduate but also don't wanna be stuck in school forever.

Sorry for the wall of text.

I am a Freshman in an accelerated Pharmacy Program on the East Coast. I've been wrestling with this idea for a lot of time recently and would like some advice for what I should do.

For starters, I am originally from California. Most of my extended family lives around the same area as me, so I tend to associate the two. When I was applying for colleges, I felt that I wanted something beyond California. I didn't want to feel like I never tried to explore beyond my home. Also, I considered my talents and influences, and figured that I wanted to become a Pharmacist.

So, once the acceptances and rejections came in, I decided that I would go to this university in New York with an accelerated Pharmacy program. Not only did it provide a direct path to a career, but it was also a big change from my normal settings. Further, I received more scholarships for that school than any others I applied to, making it essentially the same price I would pay to attend a UC. So, with a set career, big change that I wanted, and (relatively) a lot of money, what more could I ask for?

Well, now that I am in my second semester of Freshman, as well as the power of hindsight, I recognize some of the issues with my situation.

For one, the school I go to is a commuter school. I failed to take this into account when I applied, but now I realize the issues this causes. Namely, it is much more difficult to create a social circle. I don't think that it's because it's a commuter school, but because it is a commuter school in another state. Beyond school hours, campus is practically dead, with little to no events besides the introductory freshman events and the like. It feels like everyone who goes here went to the same high schools or were even in the same friend groups before they went to college, and trying to join in on these groups feels awkward at best, and downright rude at worst. Further, any sense of party atmosphere is dominated by the frats which, frankly, I'm not into. There is the sense of exclusivity where you need to know the right people to go to these events. Also, because of the commuter environment, a lot of people who do live on campus tend to go home on the weekends, increasing the lonely atmosphere that campus has.

I tried to remedy this by joining clubs, but I failed to get to know anyone beyond other freshmen who joined the club at the same time. I've made a couple of friends along the way, mostly through virtue of being in the same program or club, but nothing feels substantially close for me.

But, most of all, I feel homesick. I love New York and being able to explore it on a vastly superior public transportation system is a nice bonus. But, the more I try to explore, the more alone I feel. It feels awkward trying to get to explore a place with someone who has lived there their whole life and is not even particularly close to you. I start to think more about home and all the friends and family I left to ""Do my own thing.""

From here, I feel that I have two choices:

1. Stick it out and hope the situation gets better
2. Transfer out to another college

I have reason to believe in Option 1 because it is the same thing that happened to me in High School. I didn't truly have a reliable friend group until late into my Junior Year. I still talk with them and make the effort to hang out whenever I come back home. But, I still remember the first two and a half years of loneliness and fake-feeling friendships I had to deal with until I made it to that point. Also, who's to say it'll work out like that again?

Option 2 is a much riskier path, but the rewards I might reap are also much higher. If I do transfer out, I feel that my best option might be one of the UCs. From what I observed during my college visits, the UCs tended to have more active campuses overall. Further, with a greater number of people coming from within the state, I have much more in common with the other students.

The greatest loss out of this option is transferring out of the accelerated Pharmacy Program. One of the benefits of being within the program is that I do not have to take the PCAT. If I were to transfer out, I would first have to apply to another major, graduate, and then take the PCAT and apply into another Pharmacy School. All this taking \~8 years, whereas the current program is 6.

Another option is to attend UoP in Stockton, which also has multiple Pre-Pharmacy Programs. However, I am unsure of the exact details of how my credits would transfer (UoP has 2+3, 3+3, and 4+3 programs, whereas my current college is 0-6) or if I would even be allowed to apply to those programs. Further, UoP is also quite expensive, and I chose not to attend as I originally felt that I did not receive enough scholarships to justify attendance.

Perhaps I could do a little of both - stick it out for my sophomore year and, if it still doesn't work out, transfer.

However, I can't help but hear this nagging notion that I'm simply conflating California and Comfort. As a transfer, I feel that I would have just as hard a time with creating my social circle as I do now, simply because most friendships would have already been established. I feel this sense of awkwardness would be even greater if I tried to apply as a Junior for the same reasons. Further, perhaps it is not the environment I am in that is making it difficult, but my own shyness and personality.",college,Should I transfer to another college closer to home?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/azopb5/should_i_transfer_to_another_college_closer_to/,1552294962.0
458,ThePaulitician,1552193278,/r/college/comments/azca2u/im_making_it_unhappily/,"I've been having a tough time for the past few months at school and I'm just finding every day to be a struggle that I am in fact surviving. I was originally an economics major, then I found a second wind last summer for computer science and picked it up as a second major. I graduate Spring 2020.

I kind of ended high school on a poor note, putting in fairly lackluster effort, being overwhelmed with afterschool activities, and disappointing my teachers. It was a tough time that kind of rolled over to college. I had some domestic instability at home and I have a small family, and I couldn't bring myself to the right mindset when I was a junior and senior.

Fast forward to now. I find myself with about a year left of schooling and I haven't done anything to find a job, internship, or a spot in graduate school. My grades are fine (I have a 3.5 GPA) and I am on track to graduate on time, I just haven't had much desire to go the extra mile. I get to every class on time and pay attention, but I procrastinate on most assignments, don't routinely review, and I haven't done anything outside of the classroom. On my days off, I spend most of my time in and out of my bed, sleeping late and not really doing much.

Part of this is tied to mostly being treated poorly by friends in years past and doing too much outside the classroom when I was in high school to the point where it wasn't fun anymore. I guess I'd say I am mildly depressed. It's tough without having a family to be around anymore as things are never going to be the same way they were and I guess I find it tough to move on.

I'm intent on going into software engineering/development. I am getting a BA in CS, not a BS if that makes any difference. I have Calc I and II from AP credits and it kind of scared me to go back to math after finishing on a poor note. However, I seem to do well when it comes to helping other students when they've needed the help on a few occasions.

I have hopes of going to graduate school for computer science or industrial engineering. The plan is to move to another state and work in software for a year, then start a Master's degree in CS or IE based on the experience so far. I feel like I need to boost my resume at this point. I've worked as a substitute teacher, which I guess helps. But I'm looking at this point to maybe do some stuff outside the classroom. I've thought about an undergraduate research assistantship as my school offers them, or maybe getting involved in a hackathon or some workshops. The problem is that I get discouraged very easily because it seems so competitive and I don't see myself up there with some of the other students. I haven't even applied to any internships either because I am taking a full schedule of classes for Summer, Fall, and next Spring, so I realistically can't commit until next Spring when I will only have like 2 classes to take that semester.

Most of this motivation and desire to succeed I know must come from myself. I've thought since I am fairly good at like knowing about state mandates and other legal frameworks of college, I might try to take a path towards academic administration since I also said how I am fairly decent at tutoring. I used to spend most of my time alone and in my bed as relief from my unstable home life. Now I'll do anything to get out of it and actually do something with my life.

I have one direct subsidized loan and one direct unsubsidized loan.  My rates are do-able at $60/month, and because I've been paying a bit more it lowered some costs. But for an unemployed broke hoe like me, I can't manage it.

460,wicaksana,1551921842,/r/college/comments/ay6rw5/first_post_hate_my_life/,"I feel like shit. I've been in college 3 years now and changed my area of study 3 times. I keep trying to keep up with the friends I look up to, they're great students, very deliberate, they're in school for a purpose. Lately though, whenever im hanging out with them, I can't help but be aware of how far behind I am. I'm older than both of them but I still don't have my shit together, I don't know what I want to do with my life, don't know what I should go to school for. I don't know what I'm good for, I'm not aware of any passions I possibly have. I've been craving for a win, something to feel good about. I take classes that I think I would enjoy or would be of some worth to me. I usually get bored, frustrated and confused, and never have enough time to catch up. I recently dropped a social research class, thinking I got too much on my plate. I just feel guilty and embarrassed about it tho. When I'm with my smart friends, even though I known them for a couple years now, I still feel like the outsider, like I'm not good enough to be their friend. I want so badly to be able to impress them dammit.

I feel like I'm looking in all the wrong places for meaning and worth. For the last 3 years I've been betting on school paying off. So far it hasnt. For the last year I've been investing in my girlfriend, trying to build it into a happy successful relationship. So far that's not working out either, we still suck at communicating and making each other feel loved, well I think maybe I'm ok with giving her the attention she needs, but I feel she doesn't deliver on the love I need. I feel drained. 

In January I got promoted to manager at the coffee shop I work at. Sometimes work makes me feel good if it's busy and I'm working hard. It's only busy maybe 30 percent of the time. The rest of the time it's dead there and I imagine what it would be like working job that provides lots of hours and better pay. But I made a commitment to run this shop, I can't leave, not now at least. 

There's this motif of me getting stuck in situations I don't want to be in. I want to cut it all off. I dropped a course. I dropped out of this mind numbing dnd group. The desire to cut things out of my life is so embedded in me, I fucking shaved my head. What the fuck am I doing with my life.  Why am I wasting my time. I so badly want to drop everything I'm doing to discover what I really love, and do those things instead. This has been going on for so long, I feel so deprived. I'm becoming hateful and I'm pushing my friends and gf away. Also my cat hates me, I have no form of comfort, none from my cat, not from my friends who pity me, not from my gf who doesn't take me seriously. My family only tells me what to do, they never seek to understand what I'm experiencing.

So umm well always had a fascination with cars is why I applied to Windsor first. Then, well, noticed their requirements needed 74% in maths, whereas I got 70% in maths in my HSC, got depressed, went like, ""fuck engineering"", and applied for BBA everywhere else.


As for Brock, one of my closest friends is already there, so I guess moving to another country wouldn't get so lonely. (Only real reason I favor Brock.)


Asked a friend to help me decide on this, he just went like, ""BBA's a useless degree, go for the engineering one instead"" (I can post ss if you'd wanna see his full argument on this). But, well, if it was useless, why would so many people even go for it?

462,_VengefulSpirit_,1551572683,/r/college/comments/awodql/my_thoughts_after_one_semester_at_a_polytechnic/,"So this summer I got my diploma of maturity, which I was really proud of my grade. Really everything went PERFECT. Then I had to choose an university to go to. Physics always was my bad spot, but now I realise how stupid I was for not learning it in high school, it was so easy..

So the Polytechnic University here is known for being a really good university, but I couldn't really manage to get anywhere in it without Physics. There we some sections that required a math only exam so I chose Applied Sciences. I felt really bad after getting in, I realised I didn't want to do this, because I want to work in an IT domain, I've always loved web design and programming and I have no idea why I didn't go to an Informatics faculty in another city. So I had really depressing nights, because I realised I am at a really useless (or at least I think so) faculty. 

Then I tried to move on and go with it, so it all started. People here don't seem stupid but there aren't really many people that are super smart which makes me think this faculty is not so good, especially that it wasn't even fully filled after the exams.. 

I passed the first semester with a high grade, especially maximum grades at maths. I felt good. Now my thoughts come back again. I really don't know why I am happy about, because in the end, this domain will most likely not offer me a good job, doesn't even matter if it's IT or not. I just think it will be useless and nobody will employ me. What are applied sciences useful for, after all? ... 

I have 4 years of study to do here. And the worst thing is my parents pay for an appartment. I can't say I dissapointed them. After all, this university is good, I did well at my studies until now, but I just feel like I will break their hearts when they will see me without a job after sponsoring me for so long :( ...

I have no idea what the fuck I did to my life. I was a perfect student in high school. My final high school exam was perfect, I could go to almost any good university yet I chose this.. I feel ruined. I talked with my parents about this, they say its a good faculty and that everything will be fine and they don't really want me to move from it. Neither do I really, because just imagine, I have to start another university yet again, I will have to restart my life again, and most important, I can't study for free, because only the first faculty is free here. After you finish one, you can't study for free anymore. (Not even if you break studies in one). 

Anyway.. What can I do? I'm really depressed. Yes I've been doing fine, I learned some interesting stuff, but my sadness comes from the fact that this is an useless domain most likely and I was told multiple times that this is not the place to learn IT. Yes I learn some programming here and there, some graphics, some robot mechanics and stuff etc etc but I just don't feel good. Whenever I tell my friends from high school how well I'm doing I remember I'm at a faculty where it wasn't even fully filled... and they are at top tier faculties such as computer science, informatics, robotics etc... My best friend from high school studies here at applied sciences too, he was also a top tier student in high school but he is proud he studies here.. Don't really know what to say. I kinda was influenced a bit to come here by him as well... But anyway..

I'm really sad. I would really appreciate an advice. Should I just really quit university? I can't do that. My parents would have their heart broken and I would dissapoint them. But then I waste 4 years here without a job or anything, I won't earn a single penny and I won't do what I wanted to do all my life, I will be stressed constantly even if my road to succes in life was perfect until university. Just one bad decision ruined my life really. Come to think of it, if I just thought about other cities than the capital, I would've been at computer science without any exam, and it would've been 3 years of study instead of 4, and more easier exams, no physics, and most likely a good job. Now I am here and will be probably ruined. What do you even become from applied sciences?

464,trophyclub1,1551215244,/r/college/comments/av4l4d/the_final_answer_to_is_college_worth_it_or_not/,"Okay, so - as always, the ""Is college worth it (typically talking about money)"" question. I've heard this form numerous people and thought I would give in my input. 

If you can go to college with a reasonable debt load or no debt load, then it is worth it. Majors that are typically in demand (but not always the most successful) are: STEM majors, getting a medical degree (Nursing, doctorate, x-ray technician, dental hygene, etc), business degrees, and I'm sure there are a few more out there as well that generally provide a solid ROI. Teaching is a decent major too depending on the state, but you DO need to get your license (you can't just get the BA, some states require an MA).

CHOOSE AN AFFORDABLE COLLEGE. I cannot emphasize this enough. If you have Honda Civic money with regards to tuition-Don't buy a Mercedes! (IE Private school). Be price conscious. 

There's nothing wrong with going to a state college. Absolutely zero wrong. Except people think you MUST go to the best college to get a good job offer.

If you go to college for ""leisure"" IE a ""softer"" degree, then you should obviously take out less debt: social sciences, education majors, etc. These majors are not ""useless"", but you do need to think strongly about the money end of it if you are dropping $50,000 on it. 

STEM isn't for everyone, but neither is college. Pick something that is right for you. Don't go to college at 18 or 19 because your mom and dad made you go or because your friends peer pressure you to. You're an adult and have your own choices. Working for a year or two before going isn't the worst idea in the world.

If you don't know what you want to study, go to a two year college to get your gen eds out of the way and transfer later. It's cheaper and more effective. If you have a lower income, typically small private schools oddly can come out cheaper if you look at the financial aid package. 

If you take on loans-take them RESPONSIBLY. If you need $30,000 to go, do not take on $50,000. Don't blame college for you taking on loans because there ARE options for you to go to affordable colleges. 

I'll be finishing my four year degree for about a $35,000 price tag all-in. How? I went to a two year and got my prerequisites dirt cheap, and went to a four year near home so I could commute. I realize that not everybody has this option but if you can live with your parents for four years I strongly recommend you should do it. 

Don't go to out of state colleges UNLESS YOU GET A TUITION WAIVER.  Just use common sense, figure out the jobs that you can get afterwards and take loans out with REASONABLE INTEREST RATES and at a reasonable amount and you should be fine. 

Whether or not college is ""worth it"" is on the individual and should not be calculated on a macro level. 

When you calculate your loan balances, also think if you will be able to live with your family to pay it off, what your expenses will be in the cities you will find work, the loan balance PLUS the interest rate (the real cost of college) and make scholarship hunting just as much as a job as school is. YOU CAN GET SCHOLARSHIPS WHILE YOU ARE STILL IN COLLEGE TOO.

TL;DR-Run the numbers, do the math, will college get you to where you want to be professionally? If you answer yes to those questions, chances are it's a good idea to go. If not, there's no reason you can't start at a two year college to decide and take some classes out of the way. There's no shame in not going, choosing an alternative path, or just waiting a year or two to find yourself.",college,"The FINAL ANSWER to - Is College ""Worth It"" or not",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/av4l4d/the_final_answer_to_is_college_worth_it_or_not/,1551233244.0

So I'm 19 years old and in my second year of community college and to say I hate it is an understatement. I've always had bad anxiety over school and almost dropped out of high school. I ended up being home schooled for half of it. I thought things would get better when I got rid of the social aspect of it, but school itself just gives me anxiety.

I currently take two classes a week while working full time to support myself. I'm in a major that I thought I was passionate about, but I have to get my masters, and the thought of being in school for god knows how long is exhausting to think about. I love my job and I could see myself doing it for the rest of my life. I make enough money to rent a room at a house but I couldn't afford my own apartment. I know I can't live like this the rest of my life, but if I drop out and really work my way up, I could eventually have my own place.

The only real thing stopping me is I feel like I HAVE to finish school. My parents, bosses, friends, everyone is encouraging me to finish. But I am just so tired of it all. I feel like I'm wasting my time and energy with something I never wanted to do. No one I work with has a degree that they use, and I feel like regardless of if I finish school I'll be in the same place.

I just feel so lost. I can't tell if I'm being reasonable or it's the depression talking, but I just want to stop. I took last semester off and just worked and I loved it.

I don't know. I'm the oldest out of my siblings and my parents didn't graduate college, so their biggest goal for me is to get my degree. They've been gracious enough to even pay for my school after I moved out.

I was diagnosed with major depression when I was about 19 (21 now), although I've been living with it for years prior to that. My father isn't necessarily for treatment and I'm on his insurance which *does* cover mental health.

This year I wanted to try to take things into my own hands but they aren't going. I'm beyond maxed out on counseling sessions, the university's clinic doesn't think they'd be a good fit for me, I got a case manager who reached out to providers in the community but nearly a month has gone by and I've got nothing. I can't even find a part-time job to maybe be able to pay out of pocket for sessions somewhere and thus minimize the chances of my dad finding out about all this. And taking a break from school is in no way an option. Seriously it is NOT an option.

I'm barely getting by in school. My GPA is now a 2.4 and I've fallen into a habit of dropping classes because I just can't keep up. I even lightened my workload (part-time enrollment this semester) and I'm still just barely keeping my head above water.

I can't focus. I skip classes because I'm either exhausted or I become frustrated in class and I begin panicking and and/or crying so I  have to leave early. Trying to study is hard. I can maybe focus for like 20-40 minutes tops and after that I just can't anymore no matter how much I try to force myself.

Suicidal thoughts have become the norm. They just play on a loop at the back of my mind all day. First thing I say/think when I wake up: Shit. I should just kill myself, I don't want to be here, I want to die.

I seem to do well during class, but as soon as I get home, it's like the information went \*poof\* and it's gone. I'm even able to explain the questions to my neighbors when we have free homework time(not often in the last week), so that's what really bugs me too. Reviewing my notes does not help, because once I look back at them, it's clear they don't really contain any real information to help me solve problems on my own. It's all just really vague things on the subject, and it's not even relevant to the questions on the homework. I've tried Khan Academy and googling and I just. don't. get. it.

-I'm honestly CANNOT STAND being around to be at home around my mother anymore, I see an onset of mental illness that might worsen her behavior in the coming years and I don't want to be around that

-My high school is so boring and I feel like I've missed out on so many ""high school experiences"" I look at other people's high school and they have fun but NOTHING, I MEAN NOTHING, ever goes on in my school.

-I want to be around more of my own race, I feel like such an outcast at my high school (some of you guys may not understand this point but it has really affected my experience a lot)

I feel that after how my four years were at my current high school, I honestly deserve to have a better next four years. Besides that, I truly can't stand my mom and I don't want to feel a certain way at home after I turn 18.

The cons to this though is that I'd probably have to take out a loan and a part time job wouldn't be enough to pay it off before school ends.

I need some honest advice because I'm really stuck on what to do. I'm still 80% leaning towards going away but also still thinking about how beneficial a commuter school would be.

472,_Jerov_,1548048310,/r/college/comments/ai6vca/i_feel_like_im_choosing_my_major_for_the_wrong/,"This has been going through my head since I was a sophomore in High School. I still can't figure out anything clear. I applied to my University for a Computer Science major. I applied for computer science because all throughout my life I've had general interest in it. I like things that are logical and technical. I also like math and of course problem solving. The thing is that when I picture my older self in this career it feels empty. It feels like there's something I'd rather do than that. When I teach myself a programing language I find it quite boring after I get the basics down and I get easily discouraged by people who do what took me hours to solve in a few minutes and lines of code (I shouldn't feel that way since I'm learning but...). It's like I like CS but I don't feel that motivation to be the best of the best. It's kind of like I want to fall in the middle and that to me is a VERY bad sign. 

My other option: Finance. Anything that has to do with the stock market, the economy, and money really interests me. I feel like this is a good choice since it includes math, some programming, and problem solving, which are key to the field and I enjoy them.  I see myself in the future doing anything that is related to finance because I feel like I'd be doing meaningful work for a company and also working towards a bigger goal of getting enough knowledge to invest and maybe even start a business (I've always been very into investing and businesses). Still, I have that feeling that maybe there's something else that is better or more fitting. Finance would be a great choice if it wasn't for my not-so-great social skills and the fact that it is a little too general. Comparing it to CS, CS is a little more straightforward once you choose a concentration, pays better, and it's less risky. Finance is more than the technical side of it, which is what I really like. It's about many other things beyond the technical side that I feel won't sit well with my strengths and weaknesses. 

I just feel that if I'm considering the pay and the feeling that maybe it's not right for me so strongly that maybe I'm not even making these decisions for the right reasons. I really like both of those fields and if there was a major that included both I'd definitely out that as my options #1 and most likely pursue that major, but that's not the case as far as I know.

473,Dethlateer,1547801805,/r/college/comments/ah8lln/how_do_you_go_into_college_and_still_thrive_under/,"TL;DR will be at the bottom.

Preface: I swear I'm not a weeb. Language has always interested me and it was a tossup between Russian and Japanese because I wanted a challenge. Picked Japanese because they made my childhood games and I dig the culture and always thought I'd be a dope as fuck teacher, so it all kinda fits. Something about leaving your homeland and making a sustainable life for yourself in a completely alien country appeals to me; I feel like if I could do that I could do anything in the world if I put my heart towards it.

This is gonna be a wordy story because the basis of my issue with college is depression and anxiety, so if I bum you out then leave. I try my best to chill with the digressions.

I got into the University of Arizona with like a fuckin 2.7 GPA or something. I'm not stupid, just suddenly got lazy once puberty hit, and depressed by the time I was out of highschool. But I digress. Kek.

I went there for basically a semester and stopped going to class a few weeks into the second one. I'd made the dumbest decision ever to pick a major immediately just because my buddy did. I picked Computer Science because I've always kinda been interested in computers and programming and games and shit, and so did he for the same reasons. Immediately half my classes are math and I hated myself already at this point but my grades were absolute dogshit and I realized I hated the impending math class more than I could ever dig computers. I end up dropping a math class, but too late so it counted as an F I'm pretty sure.

I switch majors to East Asian Studies. Japanese 101 was the first class I'd ever taken in my entire life that actually had me WANTING to go to school, I really was interested as fuck in doing this and was down with doing the English Teacher in Japan thing. But with the already F on my record I was beating myself up and gave up and stoppes doing most homework which is something I could get away with in highschool but not there. I did great on tests and quizzes, but that ain't enough so it seems.

After the first semester I had a 1.8 GPA. If I fucked up again I was going to lose my loans and pretty much have to drop out. The stress huge. I was already depressed and comparing myself to all these other people I see and thinking I don't deserve to be there and I'm a piece of shit wasting an opportunity while also putting myself in debt without getting anything out of it. I'd fully succumb to my procrastination and self hatred and just kinda hermitted out in my apartment. I stopped going to Biology, then I was skipping Nutrition, then I finally hated myself enough to stop kidding myself and just stopped going to the other two.

If I recall currectly I should have withdrawn in a way that won't count towards my GPA when I go back, but I'm still in debt for two semesters and have like 8k to go and can hardly make the payments even living with my parents and working 32ish hours a week.

My 22nd birthday is Monday. Having a bit of an existential crisis. I'm the only one from the ""smart"" nerdy group of kids from highschool that isn't going to school and isn't working towards any plans and is on track to being a total waste of air.

When I think back, I really did like college. If I had just done well in my classes, I'd not have to be so fucking stressed, but the blow that the Computer Science choice did to my GPA sent me into hardcore self-loathing mode and I gave up. But other than that, I had and have Japanese friends who are fantastic and would genuinely do everything in their power to help me pursue a life in Japan. I was part of the radio club and had my own metal show on the station on Fridays where I got to jam all my favorite songs (I love music), and I had music classes I was sorta planning to take along side everything because I'm a hobby musician.

That being said, I feel like the only way I'm ever going to be happy is if I try this again. Or even a trade school or some shit but I'd be hard pressed to find anything tooly I'd be interested in, mechanical shit never got me. But I'm already fucking 8k in debt and it fucking irks my soul hard.

I can't imagine going back there, getting a job (oh yeah did I mention I wasn't even fucking working at the time? I've held a job for over a year since so I've at least built a shred of discipline since then) that I'll probably hate that probably won't pay near enough for me to comfortably live there without parent carepackages (that eat my fucking soul. Makes me feel worthless), AND just be all like ""oh that 8k you were crying about? Its 14k now."" and be fucking OKAY with it and be able to function.

So how do you do it? How do you go to college with depression? How do you do it with anxiety over your debt and the years and years of payments you're burying yourself under, let alone what if you graduate and can't find a job right away or even a job in your field, let alone if worse happens and you struggle to make payments which in turn make you struggle just in day to day  life, worse case scenario?

I've never understood the people in college that seemed super happy and just stoked on life. Like what if you fuck up yo? What if something goes wrong? The debt can potentially pin you down for life. Why am I the only one that seems to be petrified by this? Is it because I didn't get in with scholarships and shit and just got the standard little grants everybody gets?

TL;DR: If you have depression and anxiety issues, how do you keep the looming debt from stressing you out and still function well enough to both work a job and go to college while still excelling academically?",college,How do you go into college and still thrive under the crippling fear and debt?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ah8lln/how_do_you_go_into_college_and_still_thrive_under/,1547819805.0

My issue with college is the fact that none of the classes I took so far will prepare me for the ""real world"" or the career I plan to pursue.

Classes like Statistics, Calculus, Microeconomics, Macro, english, marketing, etc etc... Literally every class I took and passed so far, I can't for the life of me remember what I learned.

Its as if I simply studied and trained myself to remember the terms, definitions, and formulas just to pass a specific test and exams, however as soon as course ended, literally the next day none of the information was retained.

Add this with the fact that most jobs right now is ""learning on the job"" type, literally non of the information you learn in classes is remembered or even used in the real world.

At the end of the day- What is the point? Just to get a degree so it can open doors to your new job? That new job wont ask you stupid multiple choice questions. And if this is what school has turned into, why isn't there an option to simply pay for a degree and skip the 4 years?

I am 23 years old. I'm going to skim through my college history since I think it will help anyone who gives me advice. 

Started college in 2013, went for a full year. First semester I failed a class, second I did as well. I left school and moved across the country for a reason that doesn't matter. 

Started school again in 2016 fall, I was on FAFSA probation or whatever they call it because I failed. I failed another class because I'm a dumbass. I had a lot of really horrible things happening in my life and ended up moving back across the country. 

I've worked full time since then. I want to go back to school, I feel like I'm in a much better place and want this opportunity again, however I'm pretty sure since I failed a class while on probation I won't be eligible for aid. 

I have a horrible credit score and don't know what to do. I can't pay out of pocket. How should I approach this? I live in Milwaukee, WI if that matters.

476,tealckid,1547385594,/r/college/comments/afj9ku/how_deep_are_you_in_student_loans_and_what_plans/,"So when I first started college and applying to FAFSA  I was pretty clueless and naive on the concept of students loans and interest. The fact that you can't declare bankruptcy where the only options are to pay or default. Right now I'm on my fifth year about to graduate in spring 2019 with a major in Mechatronic Engineering with a minor in manufacturing  so it's not all bad. I'm 35k in debt plus 4k in interest so at times I have had existential crisis on how I'll manage it.  What bewilders me though  is how there are people with 70k or 100k in loans with degrees in ""Art History"" or ""Gender Studies"" who been to pretty good universities but end up in positions not even related to their degree. Now I'm not mocking people for their life choices there are plenty of intellectuals I've met  who have connections in their industry of choice and the degree is simply a formality. However, what compels  someone to dig themselves such a hole. I feel like the days of college being a youthful experience or right of passage is a thing of the past as tuition rates inflate from greed of the institutions. How I see it now is college has become a full on investment  with little room for error. So unless your dream job needs a degree (doctor, lawyer, physicist..etc) it's not worth which is why if I could do it over again I would've chosen a trade school. But what are your perspectives?

477,SimplyUnhinged,1547366083,/r/college/comments/afh9xn/should_i_take_a_gap_year_for_mental_health_if_i/,"I'm coming to Reddit mostly as a last resort because I've been deliberating over this for over a month and classes start in 2 weeks.  Here's the situation:

&amp;#x200B;

*TLDR at the bottom!!*

&amp;#x200B;

I just finished my first semester of junior year in a city college. It's relatively low-cost compared to other colleges and I have no debt thus far because my mother is able to pay for it plus scholarship money I receive. I still rely on my family and live at home. I've been pretty aimless for my entire college experience. I have no clue about what I want to do with my life nor how to proceed other than drudging through the four years to my bachelors. I also have a history of depression and it's gotten a lot worst since I entered college. I developed full-blown social anxiety and I haven't been able to make any friends. I was incredibly lonely until I started volunteering/interning at a non-prof in the school for the past year, and it's the only reason my anxiety is better. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a decent GPA but I'm a generally horrible student. I'm such a severe procrastinator that I'm in a constant state of stress and sleeplessness during the semester because of my lack of motivation. I'll just stay up all night not writing papers, then writing them or studying hours before their due date. This in itself is a problem I'm ashamed of because I should have grown out of it, but that's a different issue. It's both caused by and contributes to my depression (I assume).

&amp;#x200B;

In any case, this semester was especially bad. I overloaded myself with difficult classes and an internship and I completely burned out. I had to drop a major class I needed, and I gave in all my final papers late. I was so depressed over my personal performance, that my mom or my therapist first suggested that I could take a gap semester and work. As time went on, I decided that a break would be beneficial to my mental help, and my therapist thought so too. My mother was very supportive.

&amp;#x200B;

 For the past three semesters, I've been receiving a scholarship that pays for my tuition. It's conditional, so if I don't meet 30 credits a year, I lose it. It was my main reason for not wanting to take a gap semester. How do you just take a break knowing it will cost you thousands of unnecessary dollars? I think my mom saw how distraught I was and ensured me over and over that she wouldn't mind if I lost the money if it would be good for me. The only reason I started to seriously consider taking off was because she was so supportive. It's her money she's spending on my education. 

&amp;#x200B;

That was a few months ago. Since I've gone on break (3 weeks ago), I've been forced to seriously consider what I want to do and find work for the break. I don't want to defend myself, but I literally haven't thought much about it because once I got out of school, I went completely into rest mode. I'm extremely avoidant and procrastinate, so I put it off. Everyone is telling me to do different things (get a job/go back to school/ go part time and get an internship/ get a full-time internship) and I have no idea what to do. I feel like every choice I make will be a mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this past week, I finally settled on taking 2 classes and finding an internship or work on the side, but even that is an undertaking. The thought of going back is scary. I hate school so much, and because of the way I am, it's made me miserable and isolated. I feel like I can barely function in class, and I can't do well. 

&amp;#x200B;

So today, I finally tell my mom what I think I'm going to do during my gap, and she asks me (again, I've told her multiple times) what happens if I take a gap. I reiterated that I'd lose the scholarship and couldn't reapply. I think this made her nervous combined with my previous aimlessness. Against what she previously told me, she gently asks me if I want to just go back to class and take a gap later so I'll get another semester of paid tuition. She told me again that it was my choice, but asked me again if I really didn't want to go back. I didn't say anything, and she said that it felt like a waste to  lose free money and I'd sit at home depressed and jobless. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. Obviously, my mom is justified in doing this. It's free money and she has to pay for tuition. But I did consider this. Actually, the only reason I didn't want to take a gap was *because* of the money, and I only decided to because of how many times she told me it was okay. It's been at least 2+ months. Now, 2 weeks before class, she's suddenly asking me if I want to go back and stick it out. It changes everything. I can't justify taking a gap knowing that she prefers I go back to class. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's just that I spent a long time thinking about this. I don't even have my classes prepared for full-time because I wasn't going back. And while she still says it's my choice, she has to know that it no longer is. Obviously her rationale is valid (and a little faithless). Why would she tell me so many times that it was fine if it wasn't, and wait until I'm ready to leave to tell me otherwise? Thinking of going back full time is freaking me out. I feel so sick. I will if I have to but I don't want to. I don't know what to do. I don't think my mental health is important enough to make her pay thousands of dollars if I can manage, but all the same, my head is really spinning now that my plans might be in the trash. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her idea of delaying taking a gap is also useless to me. After the upcoming semester, I would only need to stay for 1-2 more semesters to finish my degree, so I wouldn't even bother taking a break at that point. I wanted to leave after this semester because of my poor performance and depression. So if I go back, I'd be in it for the long haul.

&amp;#x200B;

It could be I'm not thinking rationally. I don't even know if anyone will read this. I would just like someone to tell me what they think, and any advice they may have. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Tldr; I get a scholarship that pays for my tuition. I'm supported by my mom. Because of worsening mental health and confusion over career path, my mom encouraged me to take a gap year 2+ months ago. I would lose the scholarship and can't reapply, but she reassured me mult. times that she supports my choice b/c the tuition is low cost. I started planning for my gap and was set on it. Today, 2 weeks before class, mom asks me to go back full time. Stressed and don't know what to do. It's her money, but my head.*",college,Should I take a gap year for mental health if I will lose scholarship money?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/afh9xn/should_i_take_a_gap_year_for_mental_health_if_i/,1547384083.0
478,DastardlyDumpling,1547310033,/r/college/comments/af8ti6/tentative_advice_from_someones_whos_been_there/,"Salutations,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been lurking here for a while since my college days and I see lots of posts here detailing both the good and bad about their college lives and the inquiries on how to make bad situations better.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Your productivity velocity/Average Task completion for subject=Necessary time sacrifice.

Here's a very simple and easy way for most people to know how much time they need to devote to a single assignment. Measure your time to completion. Time how long it takes you to get it done. Try to comprehend how hard it was for you during the process and see if you can speed up your overall time through tricks and flow enhancing techniques. These can be striking out all the easiest questions so you save all the time to the hardest--not only for multiple choice but for those I.D. short answer questions that you can definitely get points on when you define the term for each and every one of them instead of stalling on trying to come up for an example for a single one. Knowing your working throughput makes you able to accurately set up timeboxes and deadlines to help you measure your overall time and set up cushions.

&amp;#x200B;

Also to help you know when to stop studying.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, you heard me right, stop studying.

&amp;#x200B;

I came from a high-level semi-international level Chinese school that did nothing but death-march kids through college-level material in 7-8 courses for years so the ones that made it out of high school got good by committing to two choices. We got good at suffering more than anyone else, riding at exams with eldritch curses vomited forth from our lips driven by fears ancestral disappointment and utter destruction or, and this is less common, we got really good at the metathinking and mechanics of doing the work. The cost of learning advanced trig is 4 days of hard brutal cramming. The cost of memorizing all the types of questions for the predictable exam is 4 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

Unless you plan to be a master, I suggest you don't obliterate your own minds limited willpower. And considering that most people don't come from ridiculous studying death marches since they could write, you don't have the drilled and practiced ability to suffer eternally while not losing any productivity. This is not a slight against you nor a benefit to us. It's just how you were molded by your environment and practice. There are benefits and losses to both. I explain the damage that death marching does soon enough.

&amp;#x200B;

If there is one idea that did miracles for me in college for my studies, its the concept of minimal time and effort spent to get an A-.

&amp;#x200B;

Spend much more than what is required on average, that bleeds over to other subjects, your hobbies, your clubs, and your career development time.

&amp;#x200B;

That's not a good thing. That's time waste. Time waste will gut you and bleed you good and fast when the assignments come avalanching down at the end of the semester.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get buried or you spend the rest of your time spraying crap back to your professors to crawl your way out.

&amp;#x200B;

This leads to my next point.

&amp;#x200B;

2. You don't have free time, you have expendable time.

&amp;#x200B;

Timebox your hours by the week, and absolutely by the day. If you enjoy having a spot of fun go for it. It's important to lubricate your brain and oil your fortitude with rejuvenating activities. Know that you have to include some time for yourself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Trust me, you'll need it.

  
Often, I advise people to plan around their necessary time sacrifice for academia because that's a constant but day to day, that's up to you. If you don't have class on Monday and you want to go hog-wild running around buck-naked with an airhorn clenched between your cheeks, go for it. Just know that time will be coming out of your weekly allotted time. And potentially a restraining order.

&amp;#x200B;

Students often joke about the social life, studying, sleeping triangle. You can choose two. Or if you're an engineer, just one. This is true for the average student perhaps, but you are not aiming to be the average student. I hope. Try to keep an average of your sleeping time. If you feel most rested from 11-6, go for that and do that consistently. If you party wild and hard, I recommend building a routine of power naps that will keep you charged across your days. Keep your tanks fueled or prepare to stall and break. 

&amp;#x200B;

Factor this into your timebox as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Hobbies, clubs, careers, and relationships are major concerns that must be addressed as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

My concept for this part: pick your priorities in the timebox but don't forsake all the others entirely. 

&amp;#x200B;

Specialize, but remain cross-functional. This will save you when it comes time to build a life as an adult.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Prepare for the future and accept the chaos.

&amp;#x200B;

""Your future is bright.""

&amp;#x200B;

This platitude is blasted at you more times than your roommate towards your shower curtains when they think you're not watching--side note, when living together set clear boundaries but always be prepared to bleach everything and have an out. 

&amp;#x200B;

It sounds nice.

&amp;#x200B;

Feels good.

&amp;#x200B;

Is entirely bullshit.

&amp;#x200B;

You have no idea how your life is going to go. At all. 

&amp;#x200B;

To counter this quote with a quote from Unforgiven, ""Deserve's got nothing to do with it.""

&amp;#x200B;

You don't get what you deserve. You don't get what you work for sometimes. Keep your mind on the infinite game rather than the limited one. Know what is true to you and what you want to be working for. And if you don't, accept the discomfort knowing that you are in the majority and aren't behind the curve. 

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, there is no curve.

&amp;#x200B;

So many of my classmates from high school, boys and girls who were monsters of art and science, flunked out of college. The material was easy to them. They could death march forever. But there were not prepared for the freedom. And they lacked the self-discipline.

&amp;#x200B;

Frankly, too many of us came to college to early, I would argue. Just because you can study forever doesn't mean you will. The allegory of the cave makes sense here with the cave being constant studying and the light outside being self-management and independence. In high school, what is pitched is that you have no choice. People will ride you like a rented mule in a field of snakes. Your parents, your teachers, your student leaders. They own you, on some level. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then you get to college and no one truly cares.

&amp;#x200B;

Then you learn that life isn't about managing stress or pressure if you're used to that. It's about managing the apathy.

&amp;#x200B;

This destroys kids who, by all other metrics, should be ready.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of this, just because you're good at death marching and doing academics doesn't mean you're ready for life. A few classmates that graduated along with me went into rehab.

&amp;#x200B;

Drugs. Alcohol. Depression. Loneliness. This is common. You think you can suffer forever. Until you can't.

  
They were high achievers but they broke down and gave up right after the finish line because in their minds, it was all for nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

They went to school because mom and dad told them to. Or just because it was expected of them. Or they did majors they didn't care about.

&amp;#x200B;

You need to find your own way. Find your own reason. Spend time trying to understand that. The world has very little meaning to it. Existence, if you aren't religious or spiritual, doesn't mean anything beyond 42. That's an absolute standpoint. You're looking at the relative.

&amp;#x200B;

Be pragmatic with your mind and soul. Let's not bullshit ourselves here, if you hate pre-med or accounting but think that the job is going to make you happy, you got another thing coming. The money might make you happy but let me tell you, after a certain threshold when it gets to be enough, you stop working for the money and instead for the task. 

&amp;#x200B;

Coincidentally, this is also how wage-slaving works. It's low engagement low pay work sold to you as experience or with the potential to make you rich. If you have to do these jobs, do them briefly but just leave. Loyalty is a desiccated corpse these days for a good majority of the companies that I have trained within. You are not obliged to suffer. Apologies for the tangent but it is necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to college, keep in mind the fun of these years is about the journey. Education is about more than books. Understand yourself. Know your limitations. Know your flaws. Know your strengths. Try to know them as objectively as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some hard truths might come at you, like the foundations of self-loathing for example. I learned during college that though I hated myself at times for the wrong reasons, I deserved that hate by all accounts because I didn't address the core issue. It's like beating yourself without improving so you can have more room to beat yourself later. Of course you're going to hate yourself its a self-perpetuating cycle. 

&amp;#x200B;

Engage your flaws on your terms. Engage the darkest moments on your terms. Don't think about yourself when you're in a depressed mood. Don't make choices when you're down. Be on the offense. Especially with yourself. Build on yourself. Break down yourself. Rebuild yourself. 

&amp;#x200B;

But do it while you have control.

&amp;#x200B;

No one ever won a fight by taking a punch.

&amp;#x200B;

If you need help, find it with professionals but also with friends and family if you can. The wholeness of support can drill into our very pattern driven minds that we can get better if by osmosis alone.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Don't be afraid to walk away.

&amp;#x200B;

I finished college with a GPA of 3.8. I was a writer for several clubs, the vice-president for one, a president for another, a division-three athlete, while working part-time. I finished two majors in four years.

&amp;#x200B;

You might have bad grades. You might be thinking of dropping out. You might have already dropped out.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not worth more than you. I mean this objectively and subjectively. My success does not correlate to your failure. The truth is, with the vastness of experiences and our lives, I don't know what you went through to get here. You probably don't know me. Hell, I could have been lying this entire time and just been a sapient walrus learning human behavior online in hopes of preparing for the eventual uprising led by our lord and sovereign Jamie Hyneman. However, comparing your darkest moments and your missteps to my victories and glories is a lot like saying I won while you tripped briefly on a set of stairs. A set of stairs that extends forever.

&amp;#x200B;

Know this, you are not done unless you say you are. This isn't some motivational speech bullshit. It's not me trying pump you up. It just the truth. The wheel turns on. The show goes on. The highlight reel ends.

&amp;#x200B;

I just told you all about how well I was doing in school. What I didn't tell you was following the end of college, I felt like doing nothing because I had no goals for myself for the future because I didn't care much for me and so I just sat in a dead-end job for half a year because.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I was made for bigger things but that's not what always happens. Sometimes things just go sideways. But they keep going.

&amp;#x200B;

The point is, if you truly, definitely don't want to stay in college, that's okay too.

&amp;#x200B;

You have to live for yourself eventually. Make your own choices. Being an adult is about taking responsibility for your own life. Nothing more. The choice is up to you.

&amp;#x200B;

If the disappointment of others makes you deny your own will, know that the price of that is going to be paid by you. They will not suffer being you in misery. They will, however, complain regarding why you are miserable, as I have observed with multiple peers and their friends who are parochial if I am to describe them gently.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'd like to end this tentative smattering of advice with a shameless plug for a book series, The Stormlight Archive. Yes, it's fantasy. Yes, it feels like an anime sometimes. But even if you don't like those things, I implore you to read a single chapter in the third book, Oathbringer, titled, the Girl Who Looked Up. It helped a few people I know out of some dark places. Maybe it might do some good to you.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, happy semesters and good luck.

I've seen way too many stories of people on [r/college](https://www.reddit.com/r/college)  and all across the internet especially from people in my country the  U.S. expressing their struggles in college and in many cases people who  are unfit for college in general come on here and explain all of their  problems and frankly I just get sick of seeing all of this. I have two  older brothers one of which is 36 (he entered at 26 or something  starting in community college whereas he originally entered college in  2000 at age 18 but dropped out in his first semester) years old and has  spent about 10 years in university (I bet hes' in a lot of student loan  debt by now) first as an electrical engineering major then a computer  science major and then a information technology major and he's the  biggest loser I've ever met in my life and I am grateful everyday he's  not my biological brother.

My  other older brother is now 26 and he actually graduated from a  respected university with a political science degree but decided not to  become a lawyer despite getting an excellent LSAT score and ended up  moving back with his parents because he couldn't pay the rent even with  his roommate and took a job at CVS for a while and was even promoted to  manager at CVS very quickly but even so was only making $12,000 a year  and he did this because he felt it was unfair for him to live at home  with mom and dad without a job. He then quit his job and wrote a book  and published it on Amazon and now he is learning programming to get  into machine learning to work with AI working with his college roommate  who is now in law school becoming a lawyer to start a company in the  hopes of making a lot of money. My brother graduated with $12,000 in  student loan debt despite going to an in-state university and having mom  and dad help paying for his living expenses having left the house and  moved away to go and study. He graduated on-time in four years but even  so he hasn't amounted to much of anything in life and it is nothing  short of sad and disappointing. It shows that even if you do graduate  from college on-time and supposedly do everything right college does not  guarantee you a happy and successful life and career.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason so many young people are struggling is not just the expenses of university but also the uncertain job market and the varying levels of likely success people are to have depending on the field they get into. These days, some college majors and career paths are just not reasonable options for most people unless if they meet certain prerequisites for it to be recommendable such as becoming a lawyer in most Western countries which is flooded with law graduates. We don't ever give students an entire course about the realities of working in various different careers, the requirements to get that education, the job market, and how to determine what we want in life and what will make us happy. I know that 100% possible but instead other things are prioritized over all of those things. I personally am tempted to create a course for Udemy and Youtube for young people on how to figure out what they want to do with their life and picking a career because no one else will do that because no one cares about the young people and the struggles we have to deal with just to even make it in life!

&amp;#x200B;

Why  can't we accept the fact that college is not for everyone and that the  system for college is fundamentally broken? Don't you think that for  some people they should never go to college under any circumstances and  in many cases college is in fact a bad idea especially if you don't know  what you want to do with your life or go to a bad university or a  stupid degree program that is an absolute waste of time and money not to  mention the [$1.5 Trillion Student Loan Debt Crisis the U.S. is in Now?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2018/06/13/student-loan-debt-statistics-2018/#5577c307310f)

What are some non-profit community colleges with good only courses that i could take a look at?  I'm looking to go for computer science so I can do website design. The advisor at ctu made me think information system management was a computer science course (cause I kept telling her i want CompSci and definitely do. NOT. want. IT. at.

So I am looking for a school that i can cover the majority of the tuition with my ($5500) Pell Grant and hopefully little to no monthly payments out of pocket. Is NOT a for profit school (ITT, DeVry and now to my recent knowledge, CTU) and has decent online computer science courses.

I made this decision mostly out of a last second decision. I took the wrong approach to college applications in high school so I ended up going to a college I didn't really want to go to. I hoped it would grow on me, but it hasn't and I want to transfer. I figured what is lacking in my school and what I now want. 

First, I want to live in an actual liberal urban area or within a few minutes of one. I don't care for what region of the country, since I mostly want the experience of being in an urban area. Also I want to go to a school which has organizational support for LGBTQ students and has an accepting campus culture for it. Being one of the few openly gay students at my school is very frustrating for me and I don't want to deal with it. Also I would like my school to have an economics program, since mine does not. I plan on being a political science major. If the school has a public policy program that would be even better, but that is not a requirement. I want my next school to also have a more academic focused student body who enjoys intellectual engagement inside and outside the classroom. I would prefer to go to another liberal arts school, but I am fine with going to a school with under a 10,000 undergrad population that still has small class sizes. The one thing I love about my school is that I know my professors. Also I am absolutely dependent on financial aid. My family income is about \~50,000 so I can't pay for college nor can my parents which means the more need based financial aid I get, the better.

&amp;#x200B;

So far the schools that I think fulfill these are:

Occidental College

Reed College

Macalester College

American University

Emory University

Tulane University

I currently work in the library and compete on the school's debate team. I have won multiple awards and the school currently gives me a scholarship for it.

I figured my high school stats still matter a bit. I had a 3.63 UW GPA, 3.95 W GPA and a 31 ACT. That is mostly due to B's on my transcript from before high school and a bad semester my freshmen year. I figured my semester in college shows a serious upward trend. I also had a job, was a captain of the debate team, did cross-country for a bit, did a year of lab research and presented at a conference, ran a charity drive, and I spoke at my school's TEDx. I also got credit for 7 AP exam's. I am worried that me doing less extracurriculars in college will hurt me.

I live in Wisconsin and have been recently accepted to UW Madison College of Letters and Science, but one of my goals is to try and get through college with the least amount of debt possible. I have the choice of living at home and attending UW Parkside for two years for about $15 K in tuition and transferring to Madison. This would save lots of money as I wouldn't have to pay for room and board for the two years and another $6K would be saved on tuition.

# Problem

Would I get a lesser education to where I would have to catch up when I transferred? I would have to make sure I take classes, where the credits can transfer into UW Madison and just thinking about messing up the transferring process, is giving me anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

# Additional Information

I am currently in senior of high school with an average of 3.75 GPA up to junior year and a 26 on the ACT. I passed the AP chem and computer science exams with a 3 and 4 as well as taking AP calc and biology this year which I plan on passing. I live 3 hours away from Madison and I would like to go into computer science and become a software engineer. Supposedly I have around 25k saved for my college and I have no idea how much my father is willing to help pay. I will be able to start working in the summer and have no money in my bank account save right now. I am currently looking for UW Madison, but who knows how many I will find and can get. I am a white male and live in a middle-class family.

&amp;#x200B;

Going to Parkside first seems like the obvious answer, but I can't convince myself the Parkside route is the way to go. I also have a fear of falling behind in terms of the material that I need to get good grades at Madison and play catch up.

The whole concept of ""dream schools"" and the hype of getting into the college of your choice has been turned into a cult that feeds on the desperation of prospective students.

You just *have* to get into they Ivy League or University so you need to get a leg up on your classmates. You need to pay for more APs. More SATs. More ACTs. Anything and everything.

Meanwhile, you could take dual enrollment classes (sometimes for free) or just take Honors level classes and go to community college for two years, then transfer to practically any University of your choosing.

You get into your favorite college! Great! Now you need to get into the sports. You already pay a fee for the Athletics department. Your tuition costs also cover projects like the stadium. So why are you now paying $100 for tickets to this football game?

Oh and you'll need merchandise. Sweatshirts, t-shirts, hats... All ridiculously overpriced of course.

And now you're having difficulty with the administration. You feel like you've been treated unfairly in a class, or some policy is directly detrimental to your experience. But you keep quiet because you don't want to seem like you don't have pride in your school.

Or maybe you're a minority student, and the administration doesn't seem to be paying attention to you. Some classmates have been throwing racial slurs at you but you can't do anything. Or you're a female student in a physics major and your professor tells you that you as a woman are ""unqualified"" for the field.

And now we need you to donate! Don't you want to contribute to this school even more? Think of the good a monthly donation of just $30 could make to the education at this school...

Do you see what I'm getting at? We as college students and graduates need to wake up to this cult. We can continue to take pride in our schools, but we should not let them boss is around and rob us blind. Every single college in America is equally guilty in the growing student debt crisis, and as we learn and take pride in our colleges, we must never forget that they can and are the source of a massive amount of economic, mental, social, and emotional hardship.

I've had this plan in my head since early high school to go to a top CS program and get my BS. Graduated high school with a 4.0 unweighted GPA and a 33 ACT while working a part-time job. Was lazy back then too but took the easiness of high school for granted and am now realizing I never really developed proper study or time management skills for college.

Over the past 2.5 years here, I joined a (professional) fraternity and I am VP for another club on campus with ~30 members. Even had an internship this past summer.

My question is, should I start a business minor once I transfer? Or will a psychology degree than graduate degree in Occupational psychology be sufficient?

Problem is I am working that Saturday afternoon during the hours the exam will be administered. My professor is deaf so I had to sign to him that I am working that day and cannot make it. He goes on to just write on the board ""I did not make the exam date, the school did"" and continues on with class. I email my adviser and am told to work it out with my professor and if I can't, to talk to the business school advising center. So after sending an email and waiting almost a week I have not heard back from my professor. I went ahead and emailed the advising center and was told to keep trying to work it out with my professor and if I cannot, to see about changing my work schedule.

I think it is pretty unfair of the school to schedule exams outside of the times I am supposed to be there and then on-top of that expect me to ignore my other obligations especially when they're used to pay for my schooling. Has anyone else had to deal with this or have any advice?

493,bubblegumpandabear,1543344081,/r/college/comments/a0xobt/i_have_a_d_in_a_class_after_missing_a_quiz_due_to/,"So this semester has been absolutely terrible. It began with my new apartment's oven catching fire and me missing classes from catching a cold before and after this fire. I've been having ongoing issues with waking up in the mornings, constant exhaustion getting sick all the time, blurred vision, memory loss, dizziness, nausea, etc. Long story short, in the month of October I had four MRIs, a spinal tap, five visits to the hospital for testing, and six neurology appointments. I found out a few weeks ago that I have MS and have started medication. As I said, this semester has been awful.

I've kept all of my professors in the loop with doctor's notes as proof so they were aware and when I finally received a diagnosis, I went to Student Accessibility services as my neurologist suggested so my professors would receive an official letter, so they know I haven't been stringing them along with nonsense or something. All of my professors have been understanding except one, a foreign language professor. 

I missed three quizzes in this class. One was because of a doctor's appointment, so I brought the professor the note and she let me retake it. Another was because I had a short time window to figure out the insurance stuff to pay for my medicine or we would end up paying an ungodly amount (think thousands) out of pocket, so I missed a quiz to meet with them in person and deal with that. I told her what happened and that I did not expect to retake that quiz, as her syllabus states you can retake up to two quizzes with an excused absence like a doctor's appointment. 

The third quiz I missed was due to being ill. I can't visit a doctor every time I'm sick, and I don't even have a car, so I just emailed her at 9 AM that I may not make it to class, which is at 1:30 PM. When I attempted to make my way to the bus, I was so dizzy and nauseous I could not even walk in a straight line. This is after my diagnosis and after I began my medicine, both of which have dizziness and nausea as side effects. She did not respond to the email but sent a notice to the entire class stating that nobody did well on a specific portion of the quiz and that she would let them retake it....except those who missed the quiz. Quizzes are 40% of my grade, so that is a problem.

I have also missed homework. I was upfront with her on two or three days when I had so much happening that I simply did not go to class in favor of studying for exams since all of my appointments were happening during midterms. There are also days when I had doctor's appointments or was sick like I was with the quiz, and not able to make it to class, and had to accept a zero on the homework. Homework is 10% of my grade. This class had one project. We had to write a speech, worth 5% of our grade, and then present it to the class, another 5% of our grade. The day I had to do the presentation portion, I went to talk to her and apologize for being a mess during the semester, but she said things that really upset me. I was crying, so she told me to submit the speech ""later"". When I got home, my laptop stopped charging and I spent all of my time attempting to make it work. That night, at 1 AM, I emailed her about it, and she replied at 9 AM that the speech was due the day it was due but to just record myself with my phone. I emailed her back that the speech was on my laptop and she never responded, but the speech portion of my grade was changed to a zero. I submitted the speech regardless yesterday when my laptop was all good, and she has not responded. 

Now, when I mentioned she said some upsetting things...here is what she said. Ever since I first started talking to her about this, she has been suggesting that I drop the class, withdraw from everything, or take an incomplete in the class. She has made several comments that to me, feel condescending. When I went to submit the first draft of that speech, she looked at it and said it was filled with mistakes and then went on about how long it must have taken me to write it. When I had just explained to her that with the constant appointments I didn't have much time to focus on writing it, but that I did my best. I guess to be fair, it was really shitty. I can write all day in the language this class is teaching, but not when I'm ill and exhausted. She has also been fond of pointing out that I don't know a lot of things I should know for this course. The thing is that I do know them, I'm just experiencing memory issues and am learning how to recall things I've forgotten. She also keeps telling me that the foreign language isn't my major, so I don't have to be taking the class. I don't need to focus on it, I can come back to it later, and I should focus on my major. Bullshit. I love this language, I've been learning it since high school and plan to visit the country one day. I'm minoring in this language and she knows this, so I actually do need this class anyway.

She also said that she didn't understand how I made an A in the previous level class, and that that professor must have been an easy grader. I actually talked to him, and he said that I got the grade he felt I deserved. She also keeps mentioning that she doesn't understand how I skipped the first level course since I don't remember things you learn in that class. Well, once again, I took those classes when I didn't have two brain lesions and a million doctor's appointments. She has told me to my face that if I don't do well on the next quiz, exam, and last few homework assignments, I am going to fail her class. And this is when I asked her what I could do to do better. 

The Student Accessibility services couldn't help me- she says that everything has been graded and she can't change the grades. They said she's set in stone on this so they can't do anything. I asked my advisor to send her an email and he said that he can't do much either, after talking to her. He said that she feels really strongly that you have to be in class to learn, which is kind of bullshit. She doesn't teach anything that isn't in the book or that doesn't appear on powerpoint slides all students can access so I could and can absolutely catch up on days that have been missed. Yes, going to class in person is very important. You learn much more by being forced to sit down and listen for a certain amount of time. But that response, in my opinion, is basically telling me that if I get sick too much I will not get any help and will fail the class. 


What the hell am I supposed to do at this point? I was going to take an incomplete, but many people have told me not to since it will only delay anything happening. Keep in mind, she is the professor for the next level course, so I will have to interact with her in the future.

Ok, so a little background. I have attended 2 public universities. I didn't like the school I first picked in high school and transferred somewhere else sophomore year. I was there for a semester, I still did not like the school very much, and I couldn't decide on a major so I decided to take some time off this past spring to figure my shit out. To save money, I decided to attend school online and thought I had decided on my major for good. The few basic majors I have bounced around between are Medicine, Criminal Justice/Psychology, and English/Teaching. The last one is the only one I've been able to completely eliminate.

I started school in September, and I like the online thing because I have more time for work and its cheaper. I am majoring in Criminal Justice right now. My problem is that every time I pick a new major, I'm good with it for a while and then I start to second guess myself and repeat the whole process over again. Right now, I'm concerned that I won't make enough money with CJ and I'm not sure what job I want. I realized I am kind of emotional and I don't think I will be able to handle dealing with angry people all the time being a police officer. I looked into like forensic science, but I would need a science degree for that. I'm also not a fan of the work/life balance with law enforcement.

Now I'm looking at medicine again. Before I wanted to be a physicians assistant. Better work/life balance than a doctor but still good pay and all that stuff. The big problem is that I can't do science online (obviously). I really don't feel like attending a fourth school, you know? I'm just a fucking mess.

Also, if its helpful, my main things I want in a job are: help people, complex problem solving, decent work/life balance, comfortable salary, and something that is a little different everyday.

So, idk, I guess I'm just looking for advice? Like from what I've said so far, does anyone have any suggestions for which major/job seems best for me? Any and all advice/input is welcome, just please don't be rude or disrespectful to me. I know I am a mess.

I can't summarize in words the feelings he's seemed to have portrayed but from what he's said, it sounds horrible, and unimaginable. Things like his mom breaking into their house and robbing them, him begging his mom to stop stealing from them just days before Christmas. I can't say everything. 

He, as you'd assume, has mental health problems, and due to this he can't join the military to help pay for college (his initial plan), and now he has no idea how to pay for college. 

He's been working since he was 16 and he has been saving but he uses all his money laying for community college and now has nothing. 

He was the first in his family to graduate high school, and he did so with honors. He did dual enrollment with the high school, he placed 2nd in a state wide business club competition, and still manages to work 30-40 hours a week in order to help pay bills and save for college. 

My parents have done well for themselves and we live comfortable. Due to this he'd stay with us often and my parents would buy him clothes and schlkm supplies. We all know what his poor heart has been through. I just don't want him to end up like everyone else in his family. His sister became an addict as well, and his brother is already smoking, drinking, and skipping school; he's the only one in his family who has a real shot at making better choices and leading a good life.

496,Mbergertn,1542235167,/r/college/comments/9x50ku/how_to_get_recruited_in_college/,"So I am a freshman in my first semester at a large university (University of Tennessee Knoxville) near my home. I chose it because I was so stressed and it was the ""easy"" route. I really liked a smaller college, Berry College, but it was out of state and I have anxiety and stuff and I just didn't want to deal with it, especially cause my parents really wanted me to go there. I made my parents think I hated it because I wanted to not think about college like an idiot. The thing is, I would have gone there to swim. In this first semester at UTK, I have realized how much I miss being a part of something like a team and I regret not going to a school to swim even D3 like Berry would have. I really hate how big UTK is and it just messes with my anxiety and stuff. I hate my roommate so that doesn't help much either. My parents know I don't like it here, and even though some may say its my decision, they are involved 100% and have as much power in the decision process as me because they pay for it etc. This first semester has been so stressful and bad for me and I really just feel so much regret for this decision. I have no friends here because all mine from high school kinda aren't friends anymore and I didn't join a frat, which im glad. I have kept up my swimming here with coaches I used to swim for cause I swam club at UTK in high school, and that is my only shining light in the day, even though I don't want to go a lot of the time. The ONLY pro about going here is that it is close to home (10 mins) so I can go whenever I want and also see my girlfriend who is a year younger than me a lot.

The thing that really hurts me is that my girlfriend, who goes to a high school about 15 minutes from UTK, just committed to play another sport at Berry. Part of the reason I chose to be here (stupidly, I know) was to be with her and now she's going to end up exactly where I could have been. I pitched a fit and made it so my parents knew I hated Berry and every time I mention it they say that I hated it etc. And they know she's going there and I have talked about transferring for a few months now, and I doubt they'd let me go to Berry because I would be ""following"" her. I know that we could split, etc. between now and then, but I just want to go there, or somewhere to swim but I can only see myself transferring there, I just have to say other places so its not obvious. I really do love her and I know the typical ""just a high school relationship, it won't last, etc. argument will come up here. I would need scholarships and stuff and I have no idea how to get academic scholarships now that I am not in high school. I just can't seem to win here. I'm sad and alone and I don't know what to do.

I have a group presentation due in a week and 2 quizzes coming up and not to mention 3 finals with 2 research essays. 


I have a month until grades are posted but I don't know if I should drop one or all and take a breather. I would hate to pay back all those dues and fees to the school because I didn't finish. 

My GPA will drop below and it won't meet the requirements to get into a graduate school for my masters program.

There's other problems that have affected this quarter like sleep deprivation from insomnia. Chronic headaches and I just got surgery done on my arm for a minor accident at work. 

I want to drop everything and never come back because I feel ashamed going back to that school. All the friends I've made would wonder what happened and why did I suddenly drop out 

I know it sounds ridiculous but I don't want people to hate me dropping out. I have a group project that's due next week but I feel like my mental health is declining and have only seen a therapist last year to treat it

-I do NOT qualify for FASFA. Only have once, and that was when my younger brother first started college 2 years back. Family makes *too much* and I'm only 23 still living at home and paying my own expenses. 

-I pay for my courses myself. 0 help from anyone or my parents at that(nothing new here). 

-I'm doing vocational school at this moment. 

I've decided to go back to school, and go back FT. I've earned my Associates 2 years ago and decided to wait on my Bachelors, due to financial circumstances. Instead of going to Uni, I decided to go back to my former community college and earn a certification in Electrical work(very similar to my college major), which is an 11 month program. 

Before I began school, I was working a nice FT office job and making a decent wage. I decided that's not what I wanted to do with my life. I saved up enough money to get me through the first semester of school, but that's only the first semester. 

The spring term has opened up for payments and is quickly approaching, but I have &lt;$400 in my savings right now. I've put my tuition on a payment plan and forwarded that plan to charge my Visa credit card at $335 a month for 4 months(this was for fall). Spring is going to be the same price with the exact same payments, but I'm afraid I cannot afford it. 

My current PT job is complete crap, and I'm looking for a second job. If I can find a second job by the time payments are due, then I'll be able to afford the payments no problem, but at this moment in time I cannot.

Scholarships. Let me just say, they're just like playing the lottery, but for free. I've applied for one and just got informed I did not win anything. I'm looking for others, but it's not as easy as I expected it to be. They all have specific requirements that have to be met, and I can't lie and say I have those requirements(live in X state, be X age, be this, etc). All the ones for my state, I keep getting denied because of my qualifications for FASFA are not met. 

Now I've looked at loans in the past, but I have never been a fan of them. The amount I'd need to make it through the next 8 months would only be $3,000, but I don't know how that would work out. I don't want to be charged hefty interest rates and I want to pay it back while I'm still in school. What to do??

500,PyroMouse44,1540755743,/r/college/comments/9s61xy/my_dad_died_right_before_midterms_am_i_completely/,"Hi reddit. Here's my situation:

Currently 21 years of age and in my 4th year of college. I am aiming to complete my B.S. in Computer Science in the spring  of 2020; and afterward aiming to get into a MS program in data science. College has not been easy on me. I graduated high school in 2015 5th in my class and with nearly 60 college credits due to a vigorous dual-enrollment program I was in my jr and sr years. I thought I was hot shit coming into University, but was very quickly knocked off my high horse. It took me nearly 2 years to figure out what I wanted to major in (from poli sci, to biochem, to finally computer science/ data science). I did not adjust very well in a dorm setting while being 5 hours away from home. I already have had to take a medical withdraw one semester (due to being hospitalized twice- for 2 weeks out of a month for being unable to manage my anxiety and OCD). Needless to say my entire adult life thus far has been one challenge after another both academically and personally.

Fast forward to this semester. I was doing fantastic in all of my classes while working 32 hours a week. I had achieved high 90s on all my mathematics and CS tests thus far. My only hurdle seemed to by physics- my Achilles heel. I'd been putting off taking physics for years as it has always been my weakest subject. But alas, I was maintaining a low to mid-B average, which was completely fine with me (I'm the type of person who only considers myself doing well if I'm maintaining all A's). The week before midterms, I was informed my father was one of a fatalities of Hurricane Michael. 

Oh, one other thing I forgot to mention- I moved across the country last year to complete school and live with one of my best friends and their family. I was 2,300 miles away from my family when I heard this news.

As anyone would do, I quickly booked a flight to Virginia for 2 days later. I was beside myself. This was the first major loss I'd ever experienced in my life, and it hurt much more to know it had happened in such a tragic and violent manner. My 18 year old sister and I were also tasked with managing his final affairs, as my parents divorced when we were 8 and 4. The past 2 weeks have been absolute hell. I have gone through so much more heartache, emotional and mental stress, as well as all the physical symptoms that can accompany grief, than I ever thought one person could take. On top of that, I'm also trying to orchestrate a contest of my father's will, as he wrote my sister and I out of it just months after my parent's divorce, obviously out of spite for my mother, and never thought to change it, as of course no one ever thinks they'll be taken so suddenly. Before finding the will, the court appointed us administrators of his estate; and we've been told now that that cannot be changed. So we now have to perform those duties with a $100,000 bond over our heads and we will never see a penny of the assets we help collect (which, of course, obviously doesn't mean more to me than the loss of our dad, but it would definitely give my sister a great start in life and would help me pay off most of my medical/student debt). 

Now that I'm back home from being in VA, I'm trying to catch up with my studies. I missed 2 midterms along with many, many important lectures. My physics midterm is tomorrow, and I've been so distraught and still reeling from all the stress I have hardly been able to study for it. I could withdraw, but if I do that I don't think I'll be able to graduate on time. I guess I'm just writing this post to ask for advice. I'm sort of at my wits end. My anxiety is rampant again, I can't sleep because my father's death keeps replaying over and over continuously in my head, each time more graphic and violent than the last. It's as if the universe keeps trying to tell me that college isn't the right path for me, but I just don't want to listen to it.

Sorry for the novel, I just really needed to lay everything out. Thanks all in advance for any advice you may provide.

After a year I switched to a Computer Science degree. Failed Pre-calc the first time around, and then took it again the next semester and passed with an A. 

This year, I started at a university. I'm a little behind schedule, but no biggie. Most of my classes are going well. But I'm still shit at Math. I can't figure out why. I take as many notes as I can on my laptop, and generally the concepts I have fairly down pat, but there's so much that I just can't for the life of me figure out. I'm failing horribly at this course. Worse, I'm broke, but not ""dorm life so broke haha"". Like I literally am starving myself because I can't afford food, and my power is getting cut off next week if I can't find money to pay it. Worse, in march of this year, I went through some shit and figured out that, contrary to popular belief and despite having a penis, a woman. So that's also seriously eating away at my mental health. I've cancelled my last three therapy appointments because I can't afford them, and my last batch of hormones was $202. I have no support system whatsoever, I work a shit ton, I have a shit ton of homework, I'm trans, but am so cripplingly anxious that despite actively growing tits I can't present female and actually try to pass as cis, which makes me worry that I'm not actually trans, which stresses me out more, and scares the shit out of me. 

TLDR: I suck at math in a field based on math, Gender has no meaning, and I wanna die. ",college,I feel like I'm drowning.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/9ngrg8/i_feel_like_im_drowning/,1539332273.0
504,cockadoodlenoodles,1538805521,/r/college/comments/9ltqys/i_feel_like_i_could_be_getting_so_much_more_out/,"Alright, so this might get a bit long.  (edit: yep, it did)

So, a preface: I lived in a dorm room my freshman year of college. It was a smaller, private (christian) university which i'm not really a fan of, but the living experience was nice and unique. I mean, it wasn't for me really specifically &amp; personally, because my roommate was never around, and whenever she *was* around (literally only 5 or 6 days the entire academic year did she ever actually stay in the room and stay overnight), she wasn't a big fan of me...

...but, that's all besides the point: Mostly everyone in the building loved their living experience, because everyone was friendly and social and connected with each other, lots of people always kept their doors opened, there was a lot of Hall events in the main lobby/lounge areas, or Floor/Wing events, where floors/wings would go to things with each other like campus events or have a designated night each week where everyone would go eat in the dining hall together, etc. 

Since my roommate was hardly ever around and I felt kind of out of place at this university, I hardly ever actually *did* any of that stuff except for a couple of events/outings during my first semester. But, nonetheless, I was still appreciative of and acknowledged how tight everyone on each floor was with each other and how everyone was mostly friendly to each other. Especially now, I realize how much i'd appreciate it and, looking back, I wish I would've appreciated it more. 

For my sophomore year, I transferred to a primarily commuter school in the big city. I definitely *wanted* to live in an official on-campus residence hall, but my transfer stuff didn't get accepted soon enough so by the time I was officially accepted to the university, on-campus housing was full. Since I was kind of weary of the idea of signing a lease and living in an apartment with a stranger in an unfamiliar area (I didn't really know anyone at this new university), I just got a 1BD/BR apartment literally right next to campus (actually this apartment complex was *literally* right next to the on-campus housing building I live in now). 

In my one-bedroom apartment, it got pretty lonely.... I am an introvert and I definitely need and appreciate having solitude, but I got so tired of it being my life all the time. I was friendly with and had acquaintances in my classes so I wasn't totally alone all the time every hour of every day, but I was by myself way too much of the time. I knew life isn't supposed to be lived like this; people are meant to share experiences with other people and live among each other! But I was doing so much stuff by myself. Living, eating, walking to class, driving, going to the movies, etc. I know i'm not supposed to be living like this and I know there is so much more you're supposed to get out of your college experience.

So, that lasted for a year and a half. My lease ended in October of 2017. I was casually looking for roommates (or at least apartments nearby that placed you with other roommates who applied to live there too) but, me and my family (who help with my college expenses) decided that it would be best to try and see if i could get on-campus housing again. So, i luckily got offered and then accepted a room in the same residence hall that i had always walked past outside of my apartment complex every day, I extended my lease for just 2 more months at my apartment to the end of the fall semester, and then in January, I moved into on-campus housing.

I had always envied people who lived in this hall and on-campus in general, and actually got to have that on-campus dorm living experience. So,  I was pretty amped to live on-campus again, to meet new people and finally make friends in my hall on my floor! 

Well, let's just cut to the chase and say that went to shit pretty soon after i moved in. My new roommate  and I were totally cool with each other and never really had any problems, but she was never there and I hardly ever saw her (probably only 4-5 times the entire semester...... much like my roommate in my freshman year at my previous university). 

The on-campus residence hall experience was nothing like it was at my old school. Now, this *is* a completely different kind of school than my old one -- way bigger, way more diverse, people who go/live here live many different lifestyles than the students at my old university that I lived with did -- but, still, i'm quite disappointed. 

I obviously pay a lot of money to live here, and I know you can't force people to be friends just because they live in the same building as you, but, still........ Not counting my roommate, I only know the names of like 2 other people on my entire floor, tops. I think that's a bit ridiculous. 

Also, our RA we originally had at the start of the semester is different than the one we have now, and I haven't &amp; I don't even actually think *anyone* on our floor has even formally *met* our RA. I barely saw him and said like two words to him (maybe?) the day he was moving in, but other than that, nothing. At all. *Is that* ridiculous? Redditors, was your on-campus experience with your RA anything like this, where they were completely absent and you don't even know them at all, and they never do anything as a floor, etc?

Our floor as a GroupMe group chat, but hardly anyone ever talks in it. Sometimes I consider asking people if they wanna hang or go eat or go to on-campus events (there are organizations that host fun activities to go to like movies, game nights, etc. every week) in it, but I feel like that may be awkward at this point in the semester since we already don't know any of each other and it might make me even just look desperate. (Not gonna lie though, I kind of am lol.) I mean, other people on my floor already have friends that they hang out with, and that's fine, but as you can tell if you've read this whole thing..... i've kind of had an abnormal college experience (partially my fault, but this is the way it is nonetheless) and I moved on-campus so that i could make friends and live around other people who I went to school with. And i'm not getting that at all. I feel like I could be getting so much more out of my on-campus living experience.

So,... Thoughts?! I've considered reaching out to my RA and suggesting some ideas to help our floor residents be more connected and friendly with each other (like movie nights, game nights, dinner at the campus dining hall outings on a designated day each week, etc.) like my old dorm at my old school used to have. Should I? Or should I just go for it and try to facilitate these things on my own and just go to try and meet people on my floor? Or should I do a mixture of both?

Yep, this ended up being so long. Ugh. Please, if anyone out there reads through all this, please help and give me advice. I am desperate here!!",college,I feel like I could be getting so much more out of my on-campus living experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/9ltqys/i_feel_like_i_could_be_getting_so_much_more_out/,1538823521.0
505,lithrica,1538645244,/r/college/comments/9labs4/school_frustrations/,"I'm at a snapping point with this university I'm going to, and I don't know what to do at this point.

So, from the very first day, things have sucked. I'm a non-traditional student, and for my first year, I have to stay in the dorms because student housing prioritizes families and people with disabilities, and I didn't have money to make rent, so I didn't really fight it. This is fine, it gives me a roof over my head and daily meals.

I got this professor for a language class, who, very first day, said most of us will fail or drop because it's a hard language. And instead of first teaching us the alphabet and teaching it like we were elementary students (you know, *beginners*), she forced us to start with cursive. In a language that has a different *alphabet.* 

I decided this wasn't for me, and went to go drop the class. However, this school decided that, that wasn't going to be easy. So I went to the student center to ask for an advisor, *because I was never assigned one*. The girl at the desk asked me what my major was, and I told her. She says, ""Oh...we don't deal with your major, you have to go to \[major's building\]."" So I do that, and I'm sent back to the advising office.

Back and forth, until I finally break down and *someone* was kind enough to provide me all the necessary information I needed. Which was the user name and password (different from my school log in). I drop the class.

Professor turns out to also teach the history and culture class I was taking. *Okay, fine.* I need this course for my gen ed and major requirements. I'll suck it up. She normalized domestic violence and animal cruelty, was even proud an animal died for the sake of a country she does not have ties to. I'm near failing her class because I missed a comma in a forum post. I hate her.

This school is also pushing rape prevention, which is great!! I wish I had all of these resources and information when I was raped. However, they're *really, really* pushing it that if we don't do this online course, we can't register for spring classes. However, it has brought up some really icky memories and flashbacks and feelings. So I called the student advocacy center, and asked if there was an alternative I can do because this becoming too difficult for me--especially with the current state of things. She told me that, ""I just have to do it and get it over with"". Have not completed it. Cannot complete it.

**And to add to that**, I need mental health services and medication. I am/was on medicaid before coming here because I couldn't otherwise afford it (30k in hospital bills from a suicide attempt a few years ago), but I was told that I have to say yes to accepting the student health plan this school offers, ""to help Medicaid out"" but that it'll be up to Medicaid to accept it and pay for it, if I'll pay for it or if they just keep me on their plan. The lady at the health center waives it for awhile until I pay off my other bills, and she sent it in a few weeks ago.

Also, this school *does not* offer the type of service I need. It's 25/session, 8 times a semester and extra if you need emergency services. So I had to seek out in the community, which is fine, no big deal.

Cut to yesterday. **Yesterday**, I had to pick up my medication, and another inhaler. Aaand there was full price. A whopping $80 because there was no coverage. Medicaid did not cover it, because I apparently was not covered or something. I just about started crying.

So, I called the Medicaid services today, and the lady I talked to asked me about the student insurance, because that was apparently on my file. I told her that I was waiting to hear about that--from *someone*, either from the school or Medicaid themselves, which neither had happened. So she referred me to someone else, and I'm just waiting for the call back.

And I don't know what to do. I can't afford the co-pay because I can't find a job right now, I need to be in therapy, I need my medication to be functioning and all of these other things. And I know nothing about the student insurance, I don't know what it covers and I don't know what the co-pay is or what's going on, *because nobody is telling me anything.* The lady who works at the insurance thing, at the health center, is just rude and doesn't give me answers. Only, ""Going on this will help this states Medicaid program.""

506,TheLogFather,1538575765,/r/college/comments/9l1hnz/considering_dropping_out_any_advice_appreciated/,"As the title says I am considering dropping out. I honestly have no idea what I'm doing here, I have no idea what I want to do with myself in the future and hate the idea of investing so much time and money into something that I dont care about. I currently am attending a 4 year university, am a freshman, and overall just hate my life here. 

I dont necessarily even think I hate college or learning, but I can't find any motivation to succeed here. Being here has made me more suicidal/depressed than any other part of my life. I feel like I have no good options, I either commit to staying here and possibly flunk out because I just dont care, leave and work some low pay dead end job/go to trade school which probably isnt much better or my final option of just killing myself.

Honestly suicide is really tempting, but I have a girlfriend that I know would be devastated if I did that to her, so I dont really feel like I can do that either. Does anyone else here have this same problem, or has anyone here dealt with this? Is dropping out the worst thing I could do right now, or is it okay?

I'm almost half way through the semester, but I just dont feel like I can take it here. The classes arent even that hard, I know I could pass them all, but I just lack any sort of motivation right now and dont see the point in any of it. I dont have a single friend here, the only thing I look forward to is talking to my friends from home or my girlfriend, but those just make it worse because I just want to go back.

Anyways, due to my dumb ass I now have a chem lab report due today that I havent worked on and have to type an essay that I also havent worked on, but of course I dont want to do either and honestly think I want to drop out. I don't even know what I'm asking for at this point, I just feel so lost and just cry. I need to decide if I'm going to drop out or not, but am terrified of making the decision.

Does dropping out make me a failure? Can I still be successful if I drop out? Is trade school really a viable option? Am I just a loser and should kill myself?

I go to a UC school in California. I'm from a low to middle class income family.

508,quadrobomber,1538439989,/r/college/comments/9klyin/21m_left_school_after_rough_junior_year_what_now/,"So I was studying Geography at a relatively large out-of-state school. At the time it was the second half of my junior year. I had switched to the major midway through my sophomore year after starting in Business classes. I thought it was interesting enough, but I was starting to struggle with some personal problems which eventually led to me having to withdraw from the school. I wasn't forced to withdraw, as I had a 2.5 GPA by the time I left, but my GPA had dropped drastically from before junior year. I knew that if I was staying at that school, it only would've gotten worse. Moving back home has been tough but I've been working while taking a semester off to go back at a local school in the spring. The problem I'm having is that the nearest school that has a Geography program is much more expensive and a much further commute than my other options. Another school that's closer to me is a satellite school of a well-known university and fits with my budget, but their programs are limited and I'm worried about the reputation of the school. I'm not too sure about going back into business but their communications program looks good. Money isn't really a concern for me. I have grants that pay up to 20k a year for schooling. I'd really like to not have to take out a loan for a BA in geography, though. So I have a few questions with all of this in mind.

1.) What's the likelihood of my gen-eds transferring? Both schools I'm looking at are in a different state than my first school. It's gonna suck if I'm gonna have be living at home while in school until I'm 25. 

2.) What might be some other majors that I should know about? I've never really had a strong interest for any major I've taken so I honestly just want to get a degree in something broad and start looking for work. I can't change my major again though, as I've already done it twice and I'll most likely reach the time limit on my grant if I do.

3.) What can I do with a communications degree? I may still be interested in going back to business school but I originally dropped the major because of problems in my accounting and database management classes.

4.) Is a geography degree worth it in my case? I'm interested in it but I feel it limits my job prospects.

I spent my HS years grinding to go to a prestigious university, and by the time senior year rolled around, Northwestern University was my dream school. It had the best location close to home, a decent campus, and a lovely media department (filmmaking and radio are hobbies of mine). Despite my family's misgivings about cost, whenever I was on campus or saw it’s name I felt it was \*my\* school. And, lo and behold, I got in! (As for the other top 20’s around my home city of Chicago, I also got into Notre Dame but not UChicago).

Yet when it came time to choose in April, I panicked. I heard stressful things about NU. That people there were always overworked, when I visited people were uber-professional and serious (which isn't what I'm like, I can be pretty goofy). It seemed to be a lot of work for a school that isn't as prestigious as, say, UChicago or Harvard, and I didn’t want to be stressed anymore. While I was considering Tulane University over NU, on May 1 (the deadline to choose), at 7:30PM, I had a flash of knowledge. I'll go to Notre Dame! It's plenty prestigious, people there seemed happy, the focus on the whole person was dope (as opposed to just being pre-professional), and, unlike Tulane, it's close to home! I paid the deposit.

...the next morning I felt awful. Why did I choose to go to South Bend over Evanston, just outside Chicago? Do I actually belong at a Catholic school? Did I just waste my dream of Northwestern? Long story short, I submitted a deposit to NU the next day, too .(I had filled out a form that meant I was able to do it late). Of course, I still had to decide where to go college.

I didn't decide until August. In the mean time, I was turned down by the girl of my dreams after prom, so I was a broken man in both mind and heart. Life sucked. I graduated high school, and spent the best part of an otherwise awesome summer break ruminating. For three months, deciding which school was the only thought on my mind from morning 'til night, and it gave me so much anxiety I could hardly function at times. My thoughts became pretty erratic and I was often suicidal. How pathetic was I? Here I was, the funny, tall, and undoubtedly intelligent star of my high school, wanting to kill myself because I couldn't choose between two great colleges. My world completely crumbled; my mind went to hell and still hasn't completely come back.

The whole time I filled out housing, placement exams, and such for \*both\* schools. Eventually, it came time to actually pay tuition. I obviously couldn't pay to both schools, so, with a lot of anxiety... I chose Notre Dame, much for the same reasons I paid the deposit in the first place.

I've now spent a month there, and it's... fine. My roommates are cool, my professors are pretty good teachers, my classes are interesting, and I think I've adjusted to the courseload pretty well. But, my dorm itself looks like a prison built by a Catholic school, I'm physically uncomfortable all the time, and I hate South Bend so much. As someone who loves live music and festivals and big cities, it feels like I'm not part of the rest of the world, and since there's nothing to do there everyone just drinks on the weekends. I don't drink, but even if I did, it looks like it'd be boring after like a month. As someone who doesn't like football, even the legendary ND football games get pretty monotone after about a quarter or so.

Is this what my college years will be like? Work all week, and then spend the weekends downing Natty Lites in a house off-campus in a do-nothing town? 

It's my first weekend back home and I've realized how unhappy I've been. I still don't have the feeling of wanting to be a part of ND, whereas I still wanna be in Northwestern-- even as I'm typing this. I'm worried by the fact I chose the less prestigious school, that my peers aren't as intellectually motivated as I am (though a few are), and that the academics just don't suit how interested I am in so many disciplines . On the other hand, I definitely agree with ND's mission (""to be a force for good"") over NU's superficial professionalism. I like that I'll instantly form a connection with the ND ""family"" around the world after I graduate, and I like that people think of ND as ""home"" even after they graduate-- it's a sentiment I'd like to have too, especially in this crazy world. 

In short, every time I see Notre Dame or any of its logos (which is often), I feel unsure of my decision. 

Today is coincidentally Northwestern's move-in. Though I haven't filled out any forms or logged into my account or had any contact with them for a while, I still haven't officially told them I'm not coming. I feel terrible for unfairly and illegally taking someone's spot in that awesome school, and to still be enrolled in both (presumably, maybe NU took me off the rolls). Plus, I can't go back. Even if I want to go to Northwestern, I'll never get in again after what I did-- I'd be lucky if they didn't report me for enrolling in two schools. Transferring to another college is difficult and it would mean going away from home further (unless I go to UChicago). And yet, I always feel like I'm not supposed to be at Notre Dame.

This time last year I felt so much potential after all the years I worked in HS. The future was gonna be amazing! I was gonna go to a great university! I was going to do great, maybe even historic things with my intellect! But, the future isn't amazing. Do I go to a good school? Will I become great? I don't know. I don't know if I'll ever feel normal again.

Thanks for reading this wall of text. I know my problems are pretty good ones compared to the rest of the world, so sorry for being so whiny and acting like a r/iamverysmart bozo. It just helps to finally have all my worries out there.

TL;DR: Submitted deposits to two really good schools, eventually chose the one that \*wasn't\* my dream school, and I still feel absolutely buzzed out about it. :/",college,"I don't feel too good at my college choice, and I felt even worse deciding.

I went from being a first year student in an intensive four-year biochemistry program at an undergraduate christian university to taking two really easy classes at my local community college. I also had my first panic attack in college after deciding this. During my first year of college I made a lot of good friends, *failed pretty much every class I had,* learned way more about myself and how I think then ever before, changed my spiritual/philosophical views pretty hard, and gradually changed from the optimistic/relaxed person I had always been, into a depressed and anxious individual. 

Now I work 20-30 hours a week at a local Wendy's and am a part time student at my community college. I'm unsure of what I want to do, but I've changed my dream from biochemistry researcher to psychotherapist. I love science, love music, and enjoy helping people through their emotional problems. I think I've found the right thing for me at last, but after having a rather terrible start to this semester (skipping classes, not doing homework, several all nighters, etc.) I think that I just can't work with the academic world until I have my mental/personal issues worked out. 

Also even after finally taking my ADHD seriously for the first time in my life, my psychiatrist hasn't really done much to help me (ok the meds were nice I'll admit), nor do I think he will do anything more. He says he thinks I should seek a psychotherapist (weird how that works out) and I'm currently looking for one right now.

So I want to officially get out of academia and work full time, until I'm ready to go back to college. **If that's enough information for you, then go ahead and comment, but if you want some more info on the situation, feel free to look at a LOOOONG list of pros and cons I typed out.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons:** 1. I owe nearly 20,000 in student loans that I'm currently paying a small interest off of. Both the government and state of New Jersey will spike up the interest rates on my loans like crazy (ok really more the state of NJ, man this state sucks) if I don't attend a college at least part time.           

2. I can't get a refund anymore for this fall semester, I owe what I owe and I have to finish paying off my payment plan (at least its a community college tuition and not uber expensive private christian university tuition) whether I finish the semester until December or not.

3. Let us address the fact that I am an impulsive, anxious person that turns things into nightmare scenarios and always looks for the easiest way out, usually by quitting. 

4.My career goals will become ever farther and harder to reach. I'm nervous about delaying my future career into the unforeseeable future.

**Pros:** 1. Even though I LOVE the material in these classes (General Psychology and Music History) It's been a terrible semester already and it's just started, it would be stupid to not recognize I'm worse off than before and need to bail NOW. 

2. I have a steady job that I really like and have a great relationship with my coworkers and managers. 

3. I could work more rather than study and so pay off those loans quicker over time. 

4. I've been dealing with a lot of personal/spiritual stuff so its no wonder things are going bad, my mind is in too many places. And that's already its default mode so my thinking has been getting REALLY out there now.

5. I've been ignoring hobbies I love, like reading philosophy and science, running (I used to love to run my brains out, but now I'm an unhealthy sofa spud), playing music, hanging out with friends, and dedicating much needed time to my family. Maybe that's why it seems my depression has only been getting worse. I did the same stuff last year in college as well. Completely ignoring everything I liked doing and trying (but failing) to focus everything on work/school.

6. I haven't even come close to figuring out how to manage my ADHD, how to study, or other stuff that I should learn properly to become an adult. Struggling with school is only gonna slow that down, if not make it worse. Me not having managed my ADHD also makes me struggle with school even more. Fun viscous cycle there right?

7. My future is pretty undetermined, really. I don't HAVE to go to college, get a degree, and start my lifelong career. I don't have to even stick to this career as I move on in life. I recognize that there are more important things to me and I can change who I am whenever the time is right, whenever I want.

So last week I learned that I got into an exchange program with TU Munich and my school for next semester. The study abroad adviser also told me that I was the ONLY STUDENT AT MY SCHOOL WHO APPLIED. This means I am the only one going. I really wanted to go abroad when I applied but now it is suddenly dawning on me exactly what that entails. 

I'm not really a very social person and although I've made friends in college, they are not super close friends and I often feel kinda lonely. I was kinda envisioning getting an apartment in Munich with the other people from my school who were doing the study abroad, we could hang out and be american friends together. But now I am going to go alone for four months to a country where I can't speak the language well. On top of that I guess I'm going to have to take thermodynamics in fucking German?? WTF am I even doing? Who am I going to spend time with? Who is going to be friends with a dude who can't even speak their language? Even if I find a roommate somewhere online it feels like its going to be impossible to connect with them. When I join clubs and shit now at my school (where I speak the freaking language) I have a really hard time feeling comfortable with people or making friends. Now I have to do that in German? I feel like I'm going to arrive there and just keel over and fucking die.

My girlfriend also dumped me kinda suddenly a few weeks before the school year started, since then it has been hard to be by myself without feeling shitty. I know this will get better with time, but its certainly not helping me feel less panicked right now.

Just don't go to Germany you say? There is a $1,500 fee for withdrawing from the program after being accepted :( I am almost feeling bad enough to pay it. 

I don't know if this is really the subreddit for this kinda thing and I guess I am just looking for someone to say something comforting - have you been in a similar situation and figured it out?

To be honest, she's kind of obsessed with it. I'm in this club as a VP. S has been acting crazy lately. I always have liked my position and the club that I'm in, but she's treating it like a full time job. We are not that ""well"" as in our new members always leave and our club meets once a month. She's trying to turn the game around and make it wicked successful this year. 

We have 50 members, \~20-30 active. We have 10 board members. That's a lot for a club of our size. She is super demanding and asks to meet too often to the point where I can't even go. Here are her requirements for people on the board:

* Meet one-on-one with S for an hour every week (it's useless, she wants to see how all of us are doing)
   * She treats it like a job evaluation. If I'll be honest--it's not a job. It's a club. It should have some obligations and organization but this club isn't even serving its purpose. It's literally just meetings for nothing. These meetings are useless and a waste of my time.
   * That means S spends 9 hours a week talking to the different board members
* Meet once a week with all of the board members
   * This could seriously happen once a month. We spend half of the time talking about how our weekend was. In fact, S forces us to go around the room and talk about it. We don't get anything done. Every meeting feels the same.
* Meet once a month as an entire club
   * Nobody enjoys these meetings and our new members run away. S likes to lead the entire meeting and she is very mundane about what is happening. S doesn't actually **do** anything. In fact, at every meeting we've had since March of 2018 all she's done is talk about what the club is about. We literally haven't done anything. 
* She demands to know what all of the board members' lives are like, their times, where they live, etc.
   * S keeps asking all of us for our full schedules. It's creepy. She knows how far I am from campus, etc. When she sees me around campus she asks what I'm doing to the point where it's creepy.
      * Example: she saw me studying for a test. I very quickly said hello and looked away because I was busy. S stood over me and asked what class it was for, what topic it was, what day my exam is, etc. It was super invasive and not friendly/casual talk.
* S is expecting all of her board members to give speeches about the club like twice a week in certain courses
   * This is overkill...
* S is expecting me to make the entire website for the club and pay for the domain
   * No. Sorry not sorry. I'll need help and I'm not paying for it when the school can.

I've heard that in class she just checks the club e-mail and as a result her grades are slipping. She's seriously crazy. I am not devoting this much time and effort to the club. I have courses, work,  research, and some test prep to worry about. **What should I do? Is it clear that this is not normal behavior?** I'm going to tell her upfront that I literally don't have time for these demands that are inefficient and unproductive.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day texted me again asking for more money ($10 this time). I ignored her texts but told her in person how I need money to pay for school (I am paying college myself) and how I don't get any money from my family. Friday comes along and she doesn't mention a single thing about borrowing the money, didn't even apologize for not having the money. Later that night I ask her about it and she says she never carries cash on her, doesn't go to the bank, and her bank account was frozen (she can't use her card). She drives home almost everyday so she has the opportunity to go to an ATM. Monday comes along and I ask about the money, she said she couldn't get money cause it was the weekend, bank is closed.

515,Vanilla_Vaporeon,1537209471,/r/college/comments/9gn00k/my_senior_year_feels_like_a_nightmare/,"I am in a very stressful situation right now because of my parents. I thought my senior year was supposed to be exciting and fun, but it is a total nightmare. They are hurting my mental health and my relationship with my bf, and I feel lost. Long story short my parents are divorced and do not get along at all. My family is completely fucked. My dad is very wealthy, and I do not like being around him since he is very narcissistic and can be abusive. (He is also involved in scientology but I won't get into that right now). He now tries to be a good dad by sending me money every month while I am a student. The only rule is that I have not been allowed to have a job while he gives me money.

 I am very grateful for this money, but the problem is that neither of my parents have really been helping me pay for school. Previously I have been secretly saving some of the money I get from my dad to pay off my loans later that my mom had set up for me, but I had to use it all up for this past year's tuition. It is my last semester of my senior year now, and my tuition has not been covered... AGAIN. I told my mom about it, and she told me that she ""forgot"" to set up loans for me or financial aid or whatever and its past the due date, but previously she had told me I don't qualify anymore since she got remarried to another rich guy. She basically told me its not her problem and to figure it out myself. My dad did pay for my summer internship class this past semester, but my parents had a huge fight about it first. He also just paid for a new laptop for me that he is forcing me to pay him back for, so I have a strong feeling he will say no to helping me and have another horrible fight over the phone with my mom, and my mom will probably resent me for it if he gets verbally abusive again. So now i'm scared I'm not going to make it to graduation.

On top of all this, I had to move out of my apartment because of a bad roommate, and my mom told me to move back home. It has really put a strain on my relationship with my wonderful bf of 3 years too, since I lost some of my freedom to be with him whenever I want. We even secretly lived together for a year too and it was amazing. Anyway my mom is now always upset at me about little things that aren't even my fault most of the time, and wants me to pay rent. I would be fine with that, but my dad has started giving me way less money than usual every month so that she won't get any more of his money than the child support for my sister he barely pays. 

I really don't know what to do and my anxiety is just getting worse and worse. I am almost always crying about it if I am alone too long... especially when I need to be working on my artwork for my senior art show. My bf and I have been talking about moving into an apartment together after I graduate. Then I can get out of this mess of a family and hopefully go to grad school for my masters in graphic design, but I still have to make it another few months until then, and idk if I can even afford that... my mom also says she is totally on board with us moving together since she ""can't afford my lifestyle"" (whatever that means), even though she also always makes a point to tell me to NEVER marry him.  Its like even though my mom says she agrees, she also makes me doubt it will even work out by saying things like how my bf is not who she would have picked for me (what is this, the 1500s?) and how it will suck when we break up and are stuck living together. I know that is a possibility but it sucks that she has no faith in us, or anyones relationships really. She also just told me she asked my dad over the phone what he thinks about me and my bf living together and he said he does not approve at all and would cut off all money for me.

I am feeling completely lost right now and I don't know what to do anymore.  My parents are too selfish to help me with anything, but at the same time try to control me to the point where I feel every decision I make is wrong. I am just trying to graduate and be an adult and a professional artist, but I also have to deal with all this garbage.

Lehigh University is a rather prestigious private university, I loved the campus, and I thought I would love it here. Now I am here I feel so trapped, I don't feel happy. At first I thought I wasn't happy because I was lonely, but I made an awesome group of friends and I keep making great friends, but they don't feel like a good enough reason to stay. The research opportunities for my desired field are rather limited, the school is so expensive($60,000 a year and I get no aid), I couldn't continue my out of school passions here, and I realized I don't like the east coast. I also have realized that maybe the only reasons I chose this school were to impress people, the campus was beautiful, and I knew I could make a lot of money afterwards. Which made me realize that I might've chose the wrong college for all the wrong reasons. I am not big on partying but this school has such a party culture that it is impossible to have fun without partying. Maybe I am just overthinking this entire thing and of course I am going to give this school my best effort and try to enjoy it while I am here, but I can't help but think I would be happier somewhere else. It makes sense for me to attend school in places that I wouldn't mind to live after college, so I can network and build my career while in college.

Not because I lack social skills (I am a good speaker and can do fine in public), but just because I prefer to follow my own agenda and not mingle with others for too long. But that can't be the reason, because I have introverted friends who have had internships and stuff.

I was awarded a work-study grant this school year and I applied to over 10 positions at my campus (a large university) and have not heard back from any of them. My resume is pretty good. I'm a good writer and write strong cover letters. I always include my best references too (previous professors and superiors). I've had 2 jobs in the past back home...one for over 5 years where I was given a lot of responsibility and oversight on my crew of fellow workers.

It's hard as fuck, expensive as hell, and all you get from it is some fucking piece of paper. 

My parents forced me to go and I crashed and burned in my third year so hard a teacher told me to stop coming to class out of pity for how poorly I was doing in it. I blew through 20,000 dollars only to realize I didn't even know what I wanted to do and ended up declaring no major so I just quit going and lied to my parents that I was (and still am lying to them to this day).

I'm a human physiology major taking a chemistry, biology, and math class this autumn. Usually I would do math offline. Lecture is incredibly useful! Especially because I took trig online this summer while trying to work enough to pay rent and I ended up failing. 

I tried looking at some of the reasons I wanted/didn't want to take either class.   
ONLINE TRIG  
Pros-   
\- Strong professor (Recommended by a friend, above 4.5 rating on ratemyprofessor, I will be at campus 5 days a week and can visit him during office hours)   
\- School availability  (Without a typical class, I finish scheduled classes by noon every day, which leaves more availability for study groups, office hours, and tutors)   
Cons-  
\- No lecture (One thing I struggled with in the summer class was I felt like I was teaching myself. I'm not good with going through the material myself and then going to someone with questions about *just* the material I didn't understand. I need to ask questions while I'm learning it)  


CAMPUS TRIG  
Pros-  
\- Lecture/Structure (I don't skip classes. With a scheduled class I have a concrete time to do math and have it explained to me in real time)   
\- Can still take advantage of Study Groups/Tutors (Just because I have a class doesn't mean I can't do these things as well!)  
Cons-  
\- Scheduling (I go from getting out of school by noon every day to a really awkward schedule where I have a 2 hour gap then get out around 4pm. Can utilize gap?)  
\- Subpar teacher (Mediocre rating on RMP. The reasons he was rated lower are things that would affect me, like bad at explaining things/answering questions/little test prep) 

I feel like I've really addressed the reasons I failed my math class this summer. I can't work and do school. Some people can and I applaud them for it but I can't compare their best to my best. So I'm taking out loans to pay my rent/tuition and slicing down to working a day or two a week. I never went to see tutors because I wouldn't bother with a twenty minute drive to school. Now it doesn't matter because I'll be there 5 days a week anyways. This wasn't my first online class, in fact every other online class I've taken I've gotten an A in.  I'm a bit biased if it wasn't obvious, but I really am open to both options.   


I know I'm really wordy and my brains kind of all over the place. Thanks for any advice, reddit.

This is my fifth year in college, I'm an engineering major (previously a bio major but changed it my second year in college), and I am taking  calculus 2 for the second time. Just typing that sentence makes my stomach turn. I've completed my gen eds (yay... I guess..) and I just need to complete my upper division courses. My current position isn't due to me being incompetent, but more to do with setbacks due to family issues. My household was/has been anything but healthy and has gotten continuously worse. My first year of college my mom took my fafsa money without asking. She was able to do so because I had a joint account with her (I didn't know it was a joint account), which she only helped me open because she knew how much money I was getting for financial aid. She wouldn't teach me how to drive wouldn't let me get a job or do anything that had to do with me gaining some sort of independence. 

Fast forward a year (2016). My house burned down and we lost everything (This was pretty devastating and I ended up performing poorly that semester) and my mom moved to Virginia and I was finally free of drama (atleast that's what I thought). My biological dad, who I have never lived with before lived 5mins away from my college, so I decided to move in with him after he encouraged me to, so I can have a place to stay while I saved up to move out. And come to find out he's more toxic than my mom. He tried to turn my brother against me by lying and victimizing himself. He ignored me for five days because I wouldn't stay home to wait for a package on my birthday. (Which was a package for him). Not only this, but he would even peek in my bedroom window from time to time when he knew I was in my room. I started working two jobs (35+ hours) as full time student mostly to save up, but to also keep as much distance from the place as I could because I was COMPLETELY uncomfortable living there. Once I started keeping my distance from the drama by working etc. I ended up getting straight A's that semester (Winter 2017). I ended up doing the same the next semester (Spring 2017), keeping my distance. I had $3000 saved up by this time. Then my dad physically assaulted me (two weeks before finals) after barging into my room at 12am after I got off of work. In order to get away for my physical safety, I ended up having to pay for a hotel while I tried to finish my finals but I was way to distraught and emotionally exhausted to focus. I had to file a police report , get my belongings to the hotel and try to find a place to stay so all of my savings wouldn't go to the hotel expenses. In the end I ended up being forced to drop my classes and buy a ticket to Virginia, where my mom lives, because I couldn't find a place (no close friends in the city, not much of a social life because of work and school..). I ended up spending all of my savings to get to Virginia to temporarily move in with my mom...  and back here to Cali (Tickets, Shipping personal belongings etc.)

Now i'm here, back in college. (Fall 2018) Taking the same classes from last semester that I had to drop and feeling really shitty. I'm dorming this semester and have my own room, so I know I'll performing to my full potential since me dorming by myself is guaranteed to be drama free.  I love my major, I've already started moving ahead and pre studying for the future classes dealing with circuits, but I can't shake the feeling of me already wasting so much time. Also my GPA is terrible because they wouldn't let me officially drop the classes from last semester because it was so close to finals week...

- Got in a car accident that, among a couple other things, resulted in a clean break in both my fibula and tibia, and required an implant(in only one of the bones).

- Was under doctors orders to avoid walking even with my crutches as much as possible(not like I wanted to anyway) because I could rebreak or damage the way the non-implanted bone was set. I was basically bedridden. It was this way for at least a month and non-weight bearing in general for another month, and weight bearing in the third month.

- Was under heavy medication for multiple months that made it harder to think.

Among other things that come along with car accident injuries. Basically I would have failed most of my classes due to the pain, the inability to walk to said classes, or the medication to avoid the pain. To be frank I had trouble getting out of bed to use the restroom during the first month.

So I contacted the school to figure out what to do.

Naive me from a year and a half ago took what the advisors said at face value, which looking back was the most, excuse my language, *retarded* advice I've ever received. The advice amounted to ""Just do an online withdraw and everything will work its self out on our end"". I took that to mean they already did what they needed to do to fix my situation.

I realized shortly after that this wasn't the way to go about it, contacted the school *again*, and was advised to do a medical withdrawal.

Then comes a 4 month toil to get my loans returned because nobody knew I had to send in a written request to have this done. It took contacting the president office of the school and threatening legal action if it wasn't resolved. I wasn't BSing either because I already had a lawyer lined up who would have done it for free.

I was given the contact number of the school financial aid administrator, I contacted her, and we sorted this particular problem out.

So, after all the above, shit happens, people in my family almost die, my mother gets parkinsons, my father has multiple heart attacks, and I'm not able to return to school until this year.

I started the FAFSA process and eventually found out I was ineligible for *any* financial aid, including loans, and I had to contact the school to submit a SAP appeal(Satisfactory academic progress) to get *only* my loans back. I have lost my aramark scholarship and my KEES(Kentucky Academic Excellence Scholarship).

So I'm in the hole instead of receiving a refund. I had to take out money on my credit cards to pay for school this semester because my parents credit is so bad that I had better credit than them with only student loans on my profile, so it is physically impossible for them to help me in that regard even if I were the one repaying it. I myself am also ineligible for any loans other than government loans.

I contacted the financial aid office again, this time by physically visiting it, and eventually talked to the admin there. I was told that the only way to get my fafsa back is to ""Pay them the amount you got from them""(Seems like extortion). It also seems that I have a permanent mark on my academic record because as of right now I have 15 attempted credit hours with 0 GPA and 0 PACE so I have no eligibility for any scholarships. I was also not informed that this would be the case when I called them after my accident. They only told me what I've told you.


I have no idea how to fix this anymore. I want to avoid anything legal as much as possible since I actually intend to go to school here since it's one of the better CS programs in state that I was accepted to. I'm at a complete loss and I seriously need some advice on how I can get my scholarships back.

I believe it should absolutely be possible especially since it was due to a documented medical reason, however I can't navigate the bureaucracy anymore.",college,Financial Aid lost after withdrawal due to medical reasons,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/9aadt2/financial_aid_lost_after_withdrawal_due_to/,1535251090.0
524,avocadoambassador,1535218826,/r/college/comments/9a8l0s/to_transfer_or_not_to_transfer_again/,"Hello my fellow broke as students, Just wanted to get your guys input on the aspect of transferring to a different college(s).

&amp;#x200B;

 I started college 2014 and was suppose to graduate in 2018. But since I got pushed back two years, I will be graduating in 2020. So far I have attended Loyola University Chicago for 2 years and a local community college around where I lived with my grandparents for about a year or so. Just last fall I transferred to Marquette University (Fun Fact: Jimmy Butler when here!).

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons why I transferred out from: 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;LUC:  I did enjoy this place, I was able to make new connections with the staff and faculty on campus and had made good friends here.....but I transferred out because I did not receive enough financial aid and it was CRAZY expensive...(if you are wondering about scholarships? Yes, I had applied for some and got some...still not enough).

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Community College: I loved this place as well. My peers who I had classes with, taught me that you DO NOT have to finish college within a goddamn given time. EVERYONE finishes at their own pace. I transferred out from here to be closer to my parents in MKE (Because they wanted me to and I had no choice).

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;MU: I also Love this school for the programs that they offer. I felt like the professors were actually teaching me something during their lectures. They also  show how much they care about their students. I also finally decided and stick to a major and minor that I really like. Here I was able to get a good amount of financial aid but not enough (definitely still expensive). 

&amp;#x200B;

I am grateful that my parents have been helping me pay for the 4 years that I've been in school. However, they are giving me a hard time last semester with helping me pay the tuition ( my parents are not willing to help me take out loans). 

&amp;#x200B;

Moral of the story that I had learn the hard way: 

&amp;#x200B;

1) Go to community college first. SAVE that MOOLA.

2) Don't go to a private school if you can't afford it...

3) Don't listen to your parents. You do you boo. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I am deciding to transfer out once again, But to a public uni. Do you guys think there is a problem when a student decides to transfers in and out of universities constantly?

525,ThomasGalbridge,1534984826,/r/college/comments/99ise8/fixing_to_have_a_big_problem_with_excess_credits/,"Okay, so my situation sounds a little complicated, but I'll try my best to be brief, sorry. For my first year and a half at a community college, I was in an A.S. Digital Media program to go for graphic design, but found that I enjoyed programming even more than designing hence chose to go into Computer Science. My second year just ended, and I'm now advancing forward with my math. However, the classes I took in the AS program transferred as electives to my Computer Science transcript. I wasn't worried about this, yet, but was aware that I may face Excessive Credit surplus during my last few semesters at UCF. However, what I didn't know and was so blind to was the fact that I can take only 150% of what my program allows, which is 90 total credits to qualify under aid.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently at 58 credits, and am taking Pre-Calc, Trig, Programming Logic (Python) and American Government. I'm almost done with my Gen-Eds, but it appears the math and science classes may be a problem. Once this term ends, I'll have 70 credits total. Then, at the next term, I'll be taking Calc I, General Physics (Required to take required University Physics I + Lab), C++ Programming, and Chemistry Fundamentals (Required for Gen. Chemistry + Lab). In a total of that term, I'll have 82 credits. At the final term which I can have aid, I'll be taking Calc II, Physics I + Lab, Chemistry + Lab, and my last Gen-Ed class which should be 14 credits total. That will mean that I've got 96 credits after next year's fall, hence, I won't be covered any more.

&amp;#x200B;

My financial director said for me to worry about this when the fall comes, but I feel like now's the time to develop a plan. My grant usually covers my tuition, so I'm not in any debt thus far, but it won't matter since I won't have any more loans and will have to pay for the last remaining classes in cash. He said the other option would be to write an appeal and see if it gets accepted for me to be covered, but that may not be likely, since I've been told it's usually granted for people who had an emergency reason. The latter choice would be to look for scholarships, which I'm now starting to do. I worked an internship for the past year, and it gave me a grant to cover a semester (A normal semester here costs $1250 on average).

&amp;#x200B;

However, my grants usually give me a check of left-over money, which is $2500-3000 every semester. I feel like I have a better chance of be able to take the final classes, which are Physics II+Lab, Calculus III and Differential Equations. I think the best decision out of all of this would be to look for scholarships and put the left-over grant money in my savings account. I live in Florida, and we have an FSU campus across the street from our college which requires us only take up to Calc II and Physics II. However, I want to go to UCF in Orlando which requires that I take Calc III and Diff Eq. I figured that because I'll graduate with my AA with over 100 credits, I may risk excess credit surplus at UCF but my financial advisor told me that I'll be covered until I reach 180 credits.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't know what I was doing my first year of college, and I can't undo my mistakes. Becoming a software engineer has been a dream of mine, and I've been really trying to kick it with these last semesters. I don't want to work a whole semester, taking the risk of life catching up with me and demotivating me from furthering school. I just can't allow that, because I want to go far in life.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think my plan could work? Are there any better ways, or recommended advice?

Basically, he wants me to try out for NYU and Macaulay Honors, but im iffy at the moment. I would like some help in deciding on what days I should take tests, or if I should even retake the sat at all. I got a 1390 on my June sat, and I have a 97 avg. on my transcript overall. I only have two 85's on my entire transcript with the rest being at least 92+/93+ for the most part. I'm still working on my common app essay as well. 

So, I've seen that NYU requires three subject tests or three aps., but I haven't taken a math ap yet (im about to in senior year). So, I decided to take the subject tests in October. However, my dad wants me to retake an sat so I can get to a 1400 or 1410, specifically the august one. Problem is, there's no seats available nearby, only in Connecticut (I live in Brooklyn oof), I can't get a free waiver + will have to pay a late fee ($76 in total &gt;&lt;), and I would have to go to a hotel the night before the exam so I can get to the testing site in time. I suggested the November one since the deadline for NYU is in January 1, but sadly Macaulay is on December 1, meaning that I can't submit my sat scores in time. 

I just feel that if I take the August one, I won't be ready at all, plus I'm still in the summer mindset. And taking the November sat will not give me time to admit to Macaulay.

TLDR: I would like some advice on whether I should take the august sat and October for subject tests, or just take the sat in November instead since the deadlines are in jan/feb. Or if I should not even retake the sat at all and just give in my 1390 + subject tests :))))))))",college,"HI, Hello!

My very first semester, I was slapped in the face with reality. I believed that I would be fully covered for the semester, due to the fact that I had no idea that they split your funds up the way that they do. I THOUGHT I had done all my research, but for some reason, this information missed me. Neither one of my parents are in the position to help me pay for school, BUT, according to FAFSA they ""are"". I had to take the max amount of a loan out $5500/yr, just to pay for school. Which is the LAST thing I want to do. 

A month before Spring 18 semester was over, I was hit with the news that one of my scholarships would be dismantled, as the President wanted to disperse the funds elsewhere to attract more incoming freshman. Just like that, I'm out of $3000/yr. 

Now here we are, Fall 18 semester slowly approaching. I currently only have 4K in scholarships. IF Financial Aid decides to award me a grant based off of my dad's income the max amount I can get for the school year is $6,095, which will be $3047.5. That plus the 4k is $7047.5, which, leaves me with roughly $2027 to pay out of pocket. They have a 4 installment and 7 installment payment plan.

 If I chose to do the four installment plan that would be $507 a month....which would pretty much be the same as doing two payments of $289 biweekly, if I chose to do the 7 installment plan. Which...combined with my car note ($227/month), that'll be about $733 a month. I work at Walmart. Say I work 120 hours a month at $11/hr. That's rough $1320 a month, that's with not taking out what they would be possibly taking out of my check. Leaving me with about $500 a month to live on....most likely less. And this is all IF they decide to award me a grant. I need another source of income.

No matter how much I try or how many additional scholarships I apply for, I can't seem to get any additional funding that isn't a freaking loan. I'm starting to feel like I might not make it through my undergrad studies, as the last thing I want to do is graduate with a metric ton of debt. I want to go to vet school, but, that dreams seems to be slowly fleeting. I'm so depressed, I don't know what the hell I'm going to do.

So, my tax return got messed up and it turns out my university never got my tax info. My parents got our family accountant to re-submit my tax return a few days ago, but it will take the IRS a few weeks to process it and then it will take my university a few more weeks to process and a few more to put together my financial aid package. All of that needs to be done by August 20th, when my tuition is due. I definitely can't afford to pay the amount it would cost, and basically I won't be able to go to class this semester (or potentially the entire school year) if this stuff doesn't get done in time.

I have contacted the financial aid office, but they said that getting an extension on the deadline is unlikely and to contact them closer to August 20th to see if I can get one.

If I can't go to class, I'd like to be able to get an internship instead. I had been contacting a company about an internship for this past summer, which fell through, but they had asked if I was available for the fall. I said I wasn't because of classes, but I could contact them and see if they have any positions available.

Should I start contacting companies and applying for internships/jobs now? I'd hate to wait and not be able to get an internship if it turns out I won't get financial aid, but I also don't want to suddenly turn down a company if I do get financial aid. I especially don't want to have a poor relationship with the company I had contacted before, since they are in a convenient location and a professor had recommended that I contact them. Also, should I explain to them why I won't be taking classes this year?

If it helps, I was an engineering major this past year but I had switched to industrial design and computer graphics technology (3D modeling, basically) for this year.

With the inability to afford any kind of prep school on our budget, he'll likely go to a public school in a rural area (town of 2300 people, Midwest).

I'm currently making around $40k a year and my wife is a stay at home mother. We're incredibly blessed to be in the sort of situation we are in and to be honest, I feel we've kind of broken the idea that Millennials can't afford anything. At the ages of 24 a piece, we pay our way for everything, house, cars, phones, almost nothing is handed to us. This is of course a result of being careful financially and having our priorities in check but moving on...

I did a little searching for colleges and to my disappointment, I could have gotten full ride to several decently sized state schools had I been guided a little better. I won't blame my parents for everything but I had no guidance of any kind and I didn't end up doing anything after high school. In my searching I thought it'd be hilarious to look up what it would take to go to an Ivy league school. I feel like I'm being thrown for a loop.

I'm thinking ahead for my son. I have very little doubt I won't be making at least 70k+ by the time he's ready for college. So by definition of the Princeton site, he could be granted full tuition and 71&amp;#37; rooming and I'd be responsible for the rest. Seeing this for the first time, it reminded me of a time where I thought I was on hidden camera. I still do not believe this is true, I HAVE to be missing fine print somewhere.

But okay, it's true, what sort of academic merit will he need in order to be accepted? Considering just the size of our town and the school he'd be going to, I'm almost certain he'd have to be nothing short of perfect. I don't want to put a ton of pressure on my son to achieve this, but I definitely want him knowing that this is an option once he's able to understand. I am really looking for some pointers on what Ivy League school are looking for if not just scores and GPA.

530,wilZow,1531696108,/r/college/comments/8z5vww/i_am_ruining_my_potential_because_i_dont_even/,"Hey guys,

bit of a sad rant here because I feel embarassed to tell my friends or family and just want to tell someone.

I live in Germany where there are 3 school systems, Hauptschule, Realschule and Gymnasium. The best is Gymnasium, you can only study at a University with a degree of a Gymnasium, the worst is Hauptschule. After the first 4 grades you advance to one of them depending on how smart/good in class you are. I always had really good grades so I advanced on to the Gymnasium. 

At around 7th grade computer games came into my life. I spent hours and hours playing Counterstrike and World of Warcraft and my grades were really suffering under it. I didn't study for any exam ever (like seriously I can't think of any exam except my A-Levels that I studied for), but thanks to my Mom I always went to class, so that and the fact that I am not dumb (probably also thanks to my parents) guaranteed me that I pass all my exams with okay grades, so that I was able to stay at the Gymnasium, I also never did homework which really pissed my teachers off. 

So all went fine, until 9th grade, my grades have gotten so bad that my teacher adviced me to leave the school and join a Realschule, at the time I was really fed up with the Gymnasium, I only stayed there up until this point because I didn't want to disappoint my parents. 

My parents are the two most wonderful people in my life, they never put me under pressure, they only wanted me to have all the choices later on in life, and that I could study at a University if I wanted to. My dad is a Doctor and my Mom a nurse, they are both extremely bright people. 

So my Mom accepted that Gymnasium was maybe not the right thing for me, but it was, I was just a lazy idiot that wanted to game all day. So I switched to a Realschule where the level of education is so much lower that I knew everything they taught since 2 years. I easily outdid everyone else in the class and got my degree with really good grades, which only supported my lazy gaming addiction.

I wanted to do my A-Levels though, so I swapped back to a Gymnasium and finished them..... with terrible grades. I hadn't learned anything and barely passed my A-Levels. The worst grade you can get is a 4,0. I had a 3,5 which puts me in the worst 5&amp;#37; in my state. 

Even though its a terrible grade it allows me to study at a University, so I am currently studying Economics at a University  no one wants to study at because its in East Germany, but thats okay, because College reputation is not that big of a deal in Germany, this was my chance to turn everything around, good grades could get me an awesome job with high pay.

Aaaaaaand I didn't turn my life around (of course), I am currently in my 4th semester and my grade average is at 3,0 (4,0 is the worst, different from America) I failed a lot of my classes multiple times, so those aren't even calculated in there. 

Now to the reason I write this post:

The rule at my Uni is, if you fail a class 3 times you have to quit your studies, and are not allowed to study the same subject ever again in Germany. Yesterday I wrote one of the exams for the third time, I actually studied for once (not enough but still), and I knew my stuff. I went into the exam feeling a bit nervous but still okay. I nailed the two first question and felt good, the third question was tricky and I spent a lot of time on it because it gave a lot of points, I managed the first part of it but was stuck at the second, I panicked and did something really dumb. I crossed through several tries of the second part and accidentially crossed through the first part which I already had solved. Now I panicked out of control, I couldn't get the question I already solved solved again and I panicked more and more, my heart was pounding at this point.

 I don't have the grade yet, but I might barely fail. I wrote my professor begging for points, but I don't know if that will help.

What do I do if I actually have to quit, I would have wasted 2 years of my life, and I couldn't study econ again, a subject that I actually like. It would break my heart to disappoint my parents, knowing that they will be very supportive makes it even worse. 

I am just unhappy with my life, every year I tell myself I will turn everything around, but I just don't, even though I have all the chances one can imagine. If I pass the exam I want to study super hard next semester, but will I actually or is it just like all the other times?

I want to turn my life around, I stopped gaming 3 months ago completely, and haven't touched it since, but now I just piss off all my time on Netflix or Youtube. 

I just don't know what to do about the fact that I am lazy, overweight and generally without perspective.

532,JereBear_2281,1531151641,/r/college/comments/8xcy1m/any_advice_on_my_situation/,"Hello everyone,

Not sure this is the right place for this but I'm going to try.

I need some help, and it's a long story but I'll keep it as short as possible. 

I just finished my freshman year of college, and now I'm worried that I won't have enough financial aid to ride out until the end of my education. I come from a family that is very mixed in it's financial status, as in my father was making absolute bank until he lost his job in 2009 due to mass layoffs which effectively ruined my parents lives, but he's also in consideration for a job that'll pay around $85,000 a year, so that would put them, and possibly by extension me, in a very good financial situation. But I've learned that when planning things it's always best to prepare for the worst, so let's just forget I mentioned that potential new job lol 

Anyways, the college I attended for the 2017 - 2018 school year cost roughly $22,000 a year with room and board, which is a necessity as it's a three hour drive from where I live. So, considering that my degree would require me to attend for five years, that'll roughly be a grand total of $110,000, and I just found out that an undergrad, who is still a dependent, can only take out up to$39,000 in government student loans. About $11,000 of that was used this past year, with grants/free aid covering the rest besides another $5000 that slipped through the cracks, which my parents ended up covering by taking out a loan that they can't afford. So that leaves me with a maximum of $28,000 in government loans and whatever grants and other free aid I get offered to cover $88,000 of college tuition. Now, looking back at how my financial aid for 2017 - 2018 worked out, and considering that my EFC went up a ton just because my sister moved out, my Higher Education award, which everyone gets, has dropped from $5000 to a little over $2000, things aren't looking very good there. Oh, and there's also the issue of your student loan eligibility decreasing every year that you're in school(I haven't fact checked that myself, buy I remember a financial advisor telling me that). 

Also, I've also been an average to slightly below average student when it comes to subjects that aren't within my interest, no matter how hard I work. All the way from 1st grade to my freshman year of college, if it wasn't related to music, art, writing or history, I would suck at it. This left me with a rather mediocre high school GPA, and things only improved slightly during my first year of college. So because of this, my odds of getting scholarships are slim to none, not to say that's kept me from applying, though. Oh, and because I'm a white male from an all white family, it seems like the entire college system assumes that I don't need any help and that I'm already at a much higher advantage than everyone else. Lol. 

So in terms of financial aid, things look pretty damn grim. There's also the option of using as much financial aid as I possibly can, and then applying for private loans, but there's no guarantee I would even get approved for them, and that would leave me at an absoluye, best situation, bare minimum of $50,000 in total debt, if I'm the luckiest person in the world. In reality it'd probably end up being closer to $110,000, maybe around $80,000. And I'm not sure that I want to take on all of that for a career that could write possibly pay sub-$30,000 a year starting out in a seemingly dying field. 

Which segways me into informing you that my current degree path is for a Music Education degree, which I would use to become a high school band director. As far as I'm aware, the only true passion I've ever had was for high school marching band, and to a lesser extent concert band. I never really had any other activities or groups where I felt like I belonged. I tried a couple different sports and a few different clubs, but none of them resonated with me. But I loved marching band and I excelled there, having earned the highest ranks in student leadership within the program. Marching band gave me the same competitiveness factor that you could get from sports, taught me valuable lessons, and gave me an overall sense of purpose. That's why I want to become a high school band director; so I can keep doing what I love while also helping new young people find a passion for it.

Now that all sounds fine and dandy, but when you realize that a high school band director will probably make scraps starting out, sometimes even less than other new educators, and the fact that school systems have been cutting music programs from public school curriculum for a while now, and are still doing so, it starts to seem like a much less viable and worthy option to out $80,000 worth if debt towards, even if it is my passion. There's also the fact that my main drive for this is for the love of the music meets competition aspect, and I'm not sure if someone who is only in it for the competitiveness should be teaching students. 

Although this is my only passion that I've discovered, I'm aware that it's not my only option. Hell, I never even considered that a life-long career. My plan was to ride that out until I was 50 or so and then start my own instrument sales and music lesson business. So keeping that in mind, I've also been toying around with the idea of going to a more local college that I can drive to everyday and pursuing a business management degree with a minor in music. Other interests and skills that I'm not sure what to do with are good-great writing skills, pretty okay visual art skills(mainly drawing), and being totally okay with doing hard work with my hands, getting dirty, and just doing ""tough guy"" work in general. I've also always enjoyed creating things and using my imagination. 

So what do I do? Do I follow my only real passion and try to attain that, even though I know I could be cut short and ruined financially before even attaining my goals? Or should I look for something else that I can pursue that matches my other skills and interests? I just feel so lost and confused right now.

Thanks for any help!

The issue is the hours. I am frequently working till 3-5 am when I work, have a day off, then need to be adjusted to wake up by 9 for classes on my days off. It's killing my motivation and my brain. I can hardly focus. Hell I am on reddit instead of writing my paper or working on math homework! Granted my grades are still mid to high A's and I stay ahead and take time to study it is just getting harder and harder. Not to mention my motivation is down the drain so I am relying on alarms to get me to doing my school work instead of just doing it. Also every day it is harder and harder to not go to class or leave early like some of the other students, it's so tempting to sleep in!

I honestly am just so sleep deprived, mentally exhausted, and don't know what to do. And this is just taking two classes in the summer! I have no idea what I am going to do with four classes in the fall. I try frequent study breaks, attempting to take naps results in staring at the wall for an hour, and going to bed early doesn't work because my sleep cycle is more centered around work than school since I work more than I go to class.

Any valuable advice? I have worked hard out of high school so that now years later I can afford to go to school and I don't want to fuck it up because I can't function on 6 hours or less of sleep 5/7 nights of the week.

535,Licetnemi_429,1530152670,/r/college/comments/8ufkvi/change_the_major_change_the_program_what_should_i/,"I've been befuddled for ages if I should change my major or program and would appreciate any advice and helpful thoughts. It had always been my dream to pursue a career in the art/design field. However, in high school, I also developed an interest for health and nutrition. I ended up doing volunteering work in a hospital to get a sense of what it was like to work in a hospital setting.  I've wanted to go into art/design for decades but also didn't know how I would use that medium to help people or contribute back to community/society. I thought that being a doctor would make me feel more useful? Anyway, I was sitting in the hospital one morning and had this moment when I suddenly realized that the hospital building was just as important as the doctors and staff members who were helping patients, which lead me to the field of interior design. It was almost like a bridge that combined art&amp;design and health&amp;science?

I also did some volunteering work in a museum setting and fell in love with the museum environment. I mainly wanted to do exhibition and healthcare design. There's something about exhibition design that makes my heart sing. There are times when we're enter a space and we're just so astounded and captured by the surrounding that we forget our worries or problems. I really want to  recreate those moments and design spaces that bring comfort to people and promote collaboration. I think our memories are one of most important things when we grow old in life. It would be amazing to create spaces that people can remember and treasure for a life time.

With that said, I'm currently in my sophomore year of college and  I feel a bit inadequate as a design student and artist. I'm learning everything that's being taught  and my grade for the major-related classes aren't sinking like the Titanic. On paper, it makes sense to take interior design to go into exhibition design. However, internally, I feel useless and I don't think I've improved my design skills. Every assignment assigned require effort and time. I would not call the work easy but it's more of that I'm not being challenged in a way that would make me think critically or grow.  When I took art classes in high school, I was introduced to conceptual thinking and there was so much more room to be creative. I also just really enjoyed the process of art making. When I'm doing interior design work, there are times when I'm inside a computer lab just working on floorplans/sections/layout for long hours. I've stared at a screen for 15+ hours straight before. If an architecture student is reading this, I probably sound like I'm complaining right now. But when you're staring at the screen for that long, you just can't help but to start questioning your life.  Interior design becomes more of this muddy state between fine arts and really technical work. It's certainly important to master the tools required for any field to be successful but I find that I'm not enjoying this particular type of technical work.  In fact, I start to feel like robot just pressing keys on the keyboard with a lack of creativity. It's very bland work. 

I also want to clarify that there is a difference between fine arts and design. There is more individualism in fine arts where as the requirements and standards have to be met in design. I enjoy painting/drawing as hobby but I don't see it as a sustainable source of income for me. I'm aware I want to pursue design and not fine arts. I'm in this place that I'm suppose to be but I don't know why I'm not completely fulfilled on the inside. I wish I was happier. I think for months, I've been trying to reject my feelings of not fully enjoying the work. The job growth for interior design is lower than some other fields but I chose it in the first place thinking it was the perfect job that would make me happy, which didn't turn out to be the case. The program I'm in is a 4 year bachelor of science in interior design and not a Bachelor of Art which has a different curriculum.  The school is popular for cs/engineering major but the interior major is accredited by CIDA. Since I'm not completely fulfilled with my education, I've been debating if I should transfer to a different program or if I selected  the wrong major. It's such a difficult choice because the atmosphere in the actual interior design workplace could vary from classroom setting. I may dislike some part of it now but enjoy it in the future(?)  I've also completed half of my degree. My school goes by  a quarter system which makes transferring out credits difficult/ maybe impossible. Moreover, a majority of my credits are art/major related which won't apply to other majors so I would have to be one or two years behind. It's totally normal to be changing majors and be unsure of what one wants to do in life.  While I agree with that statement, I also believe indecisiveness comes with consequences in terms of cost and time. Should I stick with my major to avoid paying tons of debt? Is it worth it to pay tons of debt to change program for  same major?  Or do I sound so unhappy that I should just change major overall?  Happiness is not guaranteed in any scenario. I can't say for sure that after the changes, I will be happier, which adds to the dilemma.  I was hesitant to share my mid life crisis on here so thank you for reading if you've read through the whole thing. Just thought it might be helpful to hear from other design majors or people who've changed career paths/majors. ",college,Change the major??? Change the program???

Backstory:  I went to college just after high school.  I was optimistic and hopeful.  Honestly though I was terrified.  Young 18 year old who lived what I now know is a sheltered life leaving home for the first time.  I had no idea what I was in for.  The first year I kept my head above water pretty well.  Not the greatest but I feel I did well for all the crap my freshman roommates put me through. (Mini tl;dr: lots of sex with me trying to sleep on the top bunk, lots of alcohol and parties in our apartment. Etc.)  After the first year I should have stopped.  But at the urging of my mother I kept at it.  My grades and my overall wellbeing slowly fading into the abyss.  After my 3rd year I dropped out.  I couldnt take it anymore.  I felt like a failure.  I was so ashamed.  Why could everyone else do alright at college but it was so hard for me?  What was wrong with me?  Nearly a decade later I came to realize that I want to go back.  This time to a community college instead of a university.  I have a therapist and a set of medications as well as a strong support system.  I was on academic suspension which I read means I am no longer eligible for financial aid but I am confused.  Forever? Or just until a certain time? If I cant get aid  Thats okay.  I intend to pay 100% out of pocket.  My only problem os that I won't be able to get my old transcript because of an old loan.  I would pay it but I can't get a hold of them to pay and the school won't release my papers until I pay it.






So my questions:
1. What is an academic suspension?
2. Do I have to give my new school the old transcript? (I had shit grades so id have to retake the classes anyway) 
3. Am I allowed to just start over?

I happen to live really close to a university of the same tier (think ucsd vs ucsb, so tuition costs are relatively the same). My parents have always wanted me to go to college close to home but I have never wanted to because I had a terrible experience in high school and wanted to get away from people I knew, was in an abusive relationship that gave me anxiety and was hard to escape, and I absolutely hate the area I live in. I applied to a lot of schools and got into a lot of places (including the one close to home) but I decided to go to a school that cost the same as the one I live close to. The only thing is that my parents are paying for my dorm and stuff too, which doubles the cost of tuition (tuition is honestly really cheap). They are paying for it because they did not want me to take out a loan, which I appreciate. 

When I came back from school I was honestly really happy-- I'm studying something super employable and enjoyable (chemE), I'm in a relationship with an amazing person, got good grades, made friends, was responsible at school. Everything is fine. However every single day since I've been back, my parents have been berating me about the fact that they have to pay more for my education and that I'm too privileged and I'm ruining their lives by going to school and them having to pay more. I've told them that we made this decision as a family that I would go to this school, and they themselves said that they don't want me to take out loans. However now I have to deal with bullshit every day from them about how I'm irresponsible and wasting money and how it would've been so much easier if I stayed close to home. Obviously it would be cheaper, but I have literally offered to take out loans and they refuse. At this point they said that they will bother me about this for the next three to four years of my life and I honestly can't take it anymore. I am willing to go 100k into debt total just so I am not getting yelled at and pushed around with their threats every single day.  I realize this is just one big fat rant, but I literally just want to run away at this point--they don't care that I'm 100 times happier they just care about the money. (By the way, our family makes over 200k a year. My whole cost of attendance per year is only about 10% of what they make) I dont understand how to respond other than tell them I'll take out loans (which they won't cosign).

The problem is I have to take two 4hr classes at once, 12hrs in two months, to comply with the VA at the school so I can receive my full GI bill and not be homeless. One science class alone is pretty difficult but two at the same time, plus an ""I"" in English I am trying to finish, is seeming impossible. I need to pass these classes so I'm not put on academic probation next semester.

Halfway through I decided to drop it and the clunky school website would not allow me to drop it due to ""only being enrolled in one class"", some kind of error message basically. I did not take it further and assumed it would consider me as withdrawn. No contact from school or professor.

Ever since i was little, I wanted to do something with computers. Maybe be an ethical hacker or systems administrator. Never did I realize how much it truly takes to live those dreams. My name is Matthew Cantrelle of Destrehan, LA. Let me tell you my story. 

I first decided to go to ITT tech, wanting to major in Cyber Security/Information Technology. I was really excited as the years passed by. Learning new technology, algorithms, and so much more. I had a little group of friends that stood together no matter what we faced. We were having so much fun, learning loads until that day hit. That miserable horrible day.

We were actually in the process of giving a huge amount of teddy bears to a nearby Sheriffs Department. I was the Vice President of  the National Honors Society, and we decided to make a project raising money and teddy bears to give to the little ones that might be in distress.   

A letter came to me about a month away from graduating. It was in my Student Portal when i signed in. ""Dear Matthew"" the  letter addressed ""we are contacting you to inform you that ITT Tech is closing and you will no longer be available to attend class"". 

After the devastation the letter caused, I didn't know where I could go. I looked at several schools to only realize it got worse. None of the schools taken the credits I received from ITT Tech. Meaning, I had to start all over again. I was overwhelmed, and didn't really know what to do. 

After about a week, I heard friends getting ""Forgiveness"" on the loans they made with ITT Tech. Sadly, I didn't receive funds to cover the loan. This just made everything worse. I attend a school to live my dream, it closes, then i can't even get money back to pay the loan. 

Sadly though, it doesn't end there. I attended University of Phoenix and graduated with a major in Information Technology.  The amount I owe the school is insane. I wish i could just live my life, but it feels like Student Loans are stopping me from doing that. It's hard to know i owe $110 per day to pay this loan. I really want to eventually buy a car on my own, a new house, but with these loans it seems impossible. 

So I ask for your help. Every donation helps. My goal is to really live my life. You know? I plan to propose, but i don't want these loans to transfer to her too. I'm a nice guy and I could never put someone through those huge loans. I also want to eventually get a new car, as my car is not going to last much longer. Sadly, i get denied with the loans I have under my belt and housing i get laughed at. They think i'm joking when i show them. 

I just want to live a simple life, with a simple house and a simple car. That's all I want. Most of all, i wish I could get these loans to go away. They hurt my life in so many ways. Sometimes I don't even eat because of the stress it causes me. Knowing I have to pay nearly $100,000 in student loans.

Please, if you can, spare me a donation. A donation to live a normal no-loan kind of life. I don't want these loans hanging over my head forever. I don't want anything fancy. I just want these loans to disappear.

I'm not sure if i can link anything, but if you really want to donate, just PM me and i will send a link to the story.

I was put on a plan that I followed until this semester, where I messed up again \(although I'm being flagged for pace of progression, since my GPA is above the requirements\). I not only can't go to school without financial aid, I also can't really move forward in my personal life. I was going to fix my car and pay my rent with my aid. I realize that means I should work my ass off at school but there's always SOME disaster, literally every semester. Last year it was my brother's surprise cancer diagnosis. Before that it was the depression mixed with domestic violence and a bad relationship. This semester it was my weight loss surgery and my family's eviction. I'm not trying to make excuses, I know I need to do better and I tried to explain that in my appeal. But I don't have a 3.0, I'm a 5th year senior who was supposed to graduate Spring 2019 but my counselor is pushing for Summer 2019 instead. I'm scared that this is gonna be the end of the road for me.

I was very ignorant at first about how financing an adult life, let alone an education works, but I've learned a lot in the past 3 years. My mother has her own debt, yet no degree, so she wanted me to figure it out on my own like how she had to. ***

My 1st go: Went straight out of HS to community college at age 18 as a Linguistics major, death in the family mid-semester, I dropped out due to depression, earned 4 Ws and $2.5k of debt that was sent to collections in 2016.

2nd go: Age 19, I started an out-of-state community college as a Math major. I completed 1 online English class but dropped an online Precalculus class because the textbook and materials were too expensive. It was too late in the semester to add another class. I earned a W in Precalc, a C in English, and because I dropped below 6 credits, I lost my financial aid and earned $2.8k in debt to be paid back immediately and could not enroll the next semester. 

3rd go: Now at age 20, I'm currently enrolled in a different, out-of-state community college as a Computer Science major. I took 4 classes online (2 Computer Science related and 2 Humanities classes) this Fall 2017-Spring 2018 year. Earned 4 Cs and $5500 in Federal Loan debt. 

My 4th go is coming up. I'm about to pay off the $2.5k debt from my 1st go to my local community college pretty soon. I'll be using federal loans to pay for my classes (and at some point in the next year, pay off the $2.8k debt from my 2nd go). 

If I decide to start this Fall, I'll be 21 and still a freshman. Whatever ego I have left is really damaged by this. However, because my friends don't even have to work and take 5 classes a semester while still partying weekly, I have an inferiority complex about not being in college, which is why I keep enrolling. Also, deep down, I just don't want my family to be ashamed of me if I don't get my Bachelor's.

My community college has a transfer agreement with a top ~60 university for any major. So I feel like if I did do the 4 years, I would get a good degree, some version of the ""college experience,"" and the opportunity to study abroad. But what if I can't handle the workload and/or the finances, end up dropping out again, and with even more debt. What if I graduate and can't find a good-paying job and I end up living as a slave to my debt like my mother? I've changed my major every time I started a new school and I honestly don't want to be a CS major anymore (I hate programming). I've taken over 100 career tests and still don't have an idea of what is the right educational plan for me.

Military is not for me,
I'm not the entrepreneurial type either,
Currently working part-time at a daycare and its made me realize I'm not cut out for ""people-facing"" careers.
If I didn't feel like I was so dumb/horrible at school, and it was free, I might consider a PhD because I love doing research. Besides that, my only true skills (literally the only 2 things I'm good at) are learning languages and listening to music. But I wouldn't study language/music because I'm terrified of struggling to get by every payday like my family members.

I don't have another adult in my life I can have deep conversations with anymore, so any advice at all is welcome. 

TL;DR: Horrible track record with (community) college and I'm starting to think college might not be for me. I'm starting to feel like my time is running out but I don't know what other options are good for me (not interested in military, entrepreneurship). What would you say to a 21 year old who isn't yet progressing towards a career?

I was just academically disqualified from my University today. I have 2 weeks to fill out an appeal form and from what I heard, they hardly approve them. I was almost finished I had another year to go and now it's out of reach.

I have had a lot of things happen to me. I originally went to a college 4 hours away from home until the cost of living became too much for me. I was working a full time job just to pay my rent. During my junior year, I transferred to a university in my hometown and took my junior year there. During the course of this last year, so many things have happened to me. My parents got a divorce after thirty years, my grandpa got cancer, and I'm in a mountain of debt from using credit cards to pay for everything up in my first college and I work so much I can't focus. I am out of financial aid and had a really hard time paying this year. My parents refuse to fill out the parent Plus loan which was my last option as my credit isn't good and nobody will cosign.

I am feeling really down and have no idea how I'm going to tell my parents. My brother is in college too as he is in his sophomore year and he is doing extremely well as my parents are helping him and refuse to help me. I moved out at 18 and went to live on my own due to many disagreements with them and I didn't like how they were treating me so they refused to help me. I am very jealous of him and feel like he will finish before me.

I feel like I'm out of options. I have no money to pay for school and I was almost done now I'm disqualified. Should I just take a year off and pay off my debts and save money? How should I get back into school? Since I was disqualified, how long do I have before I have to start repaying back loans? Is it 6 months?

So now it's 6 months later and I've asked him dozens of times to return it. My dad is pissed, he constantly asks where is it and I can't get this kid to give it back.

Classmate either ignores my messages or when I ask him in person he goes ""Oh I don't know where it is. I'll look this weekend"".

I've asked him 2-3 times this week already over messages and I'll see him read my message and ignore it and upload snapchats. Our final is tomorrow, should I tell him he owes me money for it?

If he refuses, can I bring it up with my college? It seems petty but ones similar-ish looking to my dads are like $20-30 online and I think he should pay up since he's being such a d**k about it.

I will be starting my first Semester @ a Cal State in the Fall &amp; *really* don't want to live at home. Only problem is, the one guy I know that's been going to the University for 1 year already doesn't want to split an apartment with me because it's expensive (can't blame him, it's about $2k a month for a decent place ~ 5 miles from campus). He also told me that with my Aerospace major I won't have time to party or do anything much outside of classes, so I shouldn't bother staying near campus.


My family's financial situation isn't too bad &amp; I plan on working as well, but it *would* add an extra cost of at least $32k over 2 years if I decide to go it alone. This is assuming I only go to school 8 months out of the year, so no Summer or Winter classes, &amp; that it takes me 2 years to get my Bachelor's. I'd also like to live near the campus so I could walk there &amp; not have to drive if my classmates decide to study @ school. Although I'd like to live near the campus, this isn't that big of a problem or factor in my decision.


So, I'm not sure if I should wait until orientation &amp; find someone/ a group that's looking for an extra roommate or just get an apartment on my own. Or if I should even do it, considering the cost &amp; what my friend said.

552,johnalderton021,1525323717,/r/college/comments/8gnwos/us_cannot_go_to_college_becauseof_my_parents/,"Alright, so I have a rather difficult and extremely stressful situation I am going through right now. I wish to go to college for accounting, get my CPA, and work for the Big 4 or a mid-tier firm. I'm a money man myself; I love money, and I love learning the language of business. Hey, I even wanted to throw in another major as well, either in finance or data science (applied statistics). But, my dreams are essentially crushed for the time being because of my parents. Pardon some of the background information, but I feel like it is needed.

My parents are the epitome of the paradox of hard-working and laziness at the same time (no disrespect, just harsh honesty); they're both extremely intelligent individuals with college educations, but they choose to work menial jobs that a high school dropout could probably do. Together, they make around 60k a year. Doesn't seem too bad right? But no, they are spenders...very big spenders. Because of this, they literally saved $0 for my college. Not to mention, they will also refuse to do the FAFSA. I've tried numerous times to convince them, but to no avail, they are firm in their stance. My parents kept telling me that they would help pay for my college, but during my senior year of high school, they suddenly throw at me that they won't be doing it anymore. As a senior, this was a major shock to me because they changed their story 180 degrees. My father told me: ""If you want to go to college, you are going to have to pay for everything. We won't help you."" Another thing that is quite annoying is how my parents are also religious fanatics. They're extremely devout Christians who basically became extremely salty towards me all because I decided that I didn't want to do religious classes anymore. For example, just because I decided to stop doing religious classes, my father did not let me drive my own car anymore (for almost a year) as well as f***ing up my checking account (a lotta money that would have paid for 2 year of community college was ""gone""). Luckily now, I opened up a new checking account at PSECU (PA Credit Union) without any chance of my father screwing up my finances. That along with what I mentioned previous have left me incredibly disillusioned as well as hopeless.

So I applied to four local colleges, knowing my situation will require me to commute, not live on campus. I applied to Elizabethtown, Lebanon Valley, Penn State Harrisburg and HACC (Harrisburg Area Community College). I tried explaining everything to the financial aid officers, but of course, since a college education in America has nothing to do with smarts but all about how much money you can wipe your ass with, they didn't do much to help at all. Even telling them that the FAFSA was not going to be completed, they still did nothing to help me. Yes, even the community college is too expensive for me (parents won't cosign any loans).

So, I have a plan; if my parents aren't going to do much to help me pay for college, I guess I'm going to have to pick up the tab right? I plan to take a gap year or two, working a full time job as a bookkeeper as well as a part time job somewhere else (that is assuming I will get the bookkeeping job). I'm going to work to my fullest capacity as well as not spending a single cent from that checking account. Also, I will be retaking the ACT and will be aiming for a really high score (32-36 range). I didn't really know about the possibilities of financial aid through standardized tests until much too late, but better late than never right? My current SAT and ACT scores are 1220 and 27 respectively.

So, is a gap year or two (working a full time job as a bookkeeper and a part time somewhere else, as well as working my butt off to get a 32 or higher on the ACT) a good idea? I really see no other alternative other than the military at this point. But that's probably not an option either because I do have chronic asthma.

So please, after my giant block text of bleh, I was wondering if any of you could please give me some financial advice. I want to go to college and I know what I want to do, but the only thing that is blocking my way is money. Do you think my plan sounds good, or do you have other things in mind? Again, the crux of my plan is assuming I get the bookkeeping job, which pays 28k a year. I really hope to read your responses because as of right now, I am at the crossroads...and am completely and utterly lost. I feel physically and mentally drained from thinking about all of this...its extremely painful to me. I know I'm smart, but colleges don't really give a damn about that; all they care about is my check to them for ten-twenty f'ing grand!

Side-Note:Plus, if I am taking this gap year to garner money and improve my test scores, do you think I'd have a chance at Wharton? My GPA is a 4.0 and I have around 10 AP classes up my belt (some of which include Calculus BC and Physics 1&amp;2). Sometimes I see the high life of people in Ivy Leagues and feel depressed. I see all the smiles, the laughs, the proms, the handsome, clean-shaven and slick-haired white guys with their immaculate Asian girlfriends, and I think to myself: some people really can wipe their ass with their money can't they?

It was only 5 months before my graduation and I was flat broke. My parents couldn't help me get through school financially, though they did help in small ways from time to time. Thankfully I had a scholarship that covered my tuition. However, I struggled to pay for supplies during my final semester and was constantly concerned that I wouldn't make it.

I had long decided not to walk at graduation—I'm not one for pomp and circumstance. I also felt grateful that I wouldn't have to spend money on a cap and gown. I didn't realize that my application for graduation and diploma itself came with a steep price tag. I know, I know... someone has to pay for the materials and the calligrapher, etc. But I just couldn't swing it. So I finished my courses and left. A month later I had a job opportunity across the country. I left and told myself, I'd pay for my diploma and application as soon as I paid off my moving expenses and got settled. But month after month passed and it slipped under my radar.

I never told anyone in my family that I didn't graduate. They celebrated me as if I had (something I still feel guilty about). It never came up at my job interview and I never advertised myself as having a bachelor's degree. I think everyone just assumed I had one, but never checked.

Feeling pressure to tie that loose end, I finally contacted the registrar at my school. To my surprise, she waived the fee and only needed to know how I wanted my name to appear on my diploma. She also needed to confirm some of my transfer credits.

I was a part of the honors college at my school, and did honors research all the way through, until my honors thesis was rejected by the board.  That really hurt, especially since it was rejected all together on a minor technicality. My favorite professors (all three of them) left my school in the middle of my sophomore year for better jobs/to retire/because their pay was cut, so I was kind of academically stranded after that. I seriously considered transferring at the end of my first year because of the warning signs I encountered, but my best friend and I decided to stick it out together. We had a minor-falling out last year and now we barely talk. I am full of regret. 

I'm relieved to be done and have a few things to be be excited about for the future: I'm getting married next spring, and I've accepted a full-time job with a ton of upward mobility. But this whole college thing is really weighing on me.  I've considered taking a few classes elsewhere later on, but I don't have the money for that right now. Lastly, when I bring this up, a lot of folks are annoyed with me. My parents are upset that they spent this money on me for this outcome, and that I seem ungrateful. My friends think I'm lucky because I'm really the only one with a job secured right now, and to them it seems like I lack hindsight. My fiancé can't quite relate (but he is very sweet about it) because he went to a different school than me and excelled and absolutely loved it.

I hate my university so much. It's the last place anyone would want to go. That's just what it is. It's a TTT safety school. 

I could state many, many reasons why I hate this place. A big one being that the professors suck ass, there is no culture (commuter school with no athletics), and nobody gives a shit. We have a 25% graduation rate. People smoke and blast music in class. The campus is imported from the 70's and the food is disgusting. I would go on but I'll spare you. 

Haven't made any friends because all people want to do is get high off cocaine or drink on campus. I didn't expect more. But now I know I can't take it. It's in a bad location, too. Campus is always empty. Since it's a commuter school, everyone already knows each other. People go home after class. Safe to say I have no friends. And I'm a social person who puts themselves out there. Yes, I've heard all the generic advice. I'm in many clubs with meaningful commitment (as an officer). I don't have any interest in the people I'm encountering. 

I'm tired of going to class, despite having grades my peers would dream of. Nobody listens to the lecture in class. It's quite sad. Everything is just sad. And the thing is that nobody here likes the school either. They rightly bash on it. Nobody wears our school's gear, they wear the gear of other schools. The management here is piss. They screw up routinely. They don't help you with anything. Nobody from my school gets an internship or job.

It's not like I didn't get involved. I'm in research, I work on campus, I'm close with professors, have leadership positions, have won awards, etc.

My problem is that I can't transfer. This school is super cheap. I can't afford to pay $1 for college. If I transferred it'd have to be to one of those 100% full-need no loan colleges. Those schools are all elite and have 5% transfer acceptance rates.

I'm planning on grad school. I can't stand another two years here. Next semester I'm taking a full load online and just coming on campus for the things I need. I'm planning on taking most classes online until I graduate. I need 1-2 courses on campus with the professors I like so that I can get good LORs for grad school.

559,f0sters5,1523489981,/r/college/comments/8blqbt/trying_to_get_my_life_together_at_26_and_fear_i/,"Hey guys. This might be a long story so I apologize, and thank you, in advance.

Anyway starting in high school, neither of my parents ever went to school, and neither really believed in it. I was never pushed to do good in school, and never encouraged to pursue higher education. Just before I graduated, the two of them had a very long, drawn out and dramatic divorce. I had just gotten out of a relationship where I had been cheated on. I stopped caring about anything and lost myself in mindless things like video games.

I bounced around from pointless minimum wage job to the next, while also bouncing between parental households as they each kicked me out repeatedly, seeing me as a failure who would never amount to anything. I began to believe they were right.

Eventually I met another girlfriend, and got a decent paying job netting me about 20$ an hour. I was still unhappy, but things felt like they were starting to look up. Until I realized this was just another dead-end job in a warehouse that I was miserable breaking my back at everyday, and even that girlfriend ended up having cheated on me for over a year of our 2 year relationship. I went into a slight depression, stopped working hard at work, and lost that job because of it. Being a dumb 20 year old at the time making that sort of money, I got a credit card thinking it would help build my credit; and it did - until I lost that job and could never pay it back. Now I'm pretty sure my credit is abysmal and I'll never be able to buy a new car let alone a house.

After I lost that job, my mom kicked me out yet again, calling the cops and having them throw me out. I lived in my car in the freezing winter for almost 2 weeks before my dad let me come stay with him again - on the premise I enroll in school, which I did the next week. I was accepted soon thereafter, started working at my dad's business, and started going to school and doing well. I felt like my life was finally going somewhere.

Those first 2 semesters, I held a 3.8 GPA going for a business major. However there were still some things that were getting at me - I had little to no friends, my dad's new wife hated me and made me feel worthless all the time, and because of that my dad told me I was ruining his new marriage, and to top it off I didn't even know what I was going to school for outside of my parents telling me to so that I would simply have a place to live. I started skipping class, which was infectious and go to the point I would only go on test days. My GPA dropped but I was still passing my classes; until in the latter part of my second year, my dad's shop started to do really poorly - he couldn't afford to buy new supplies or things to sell, and he somehow blamed me for it. I was doing the best that I could. I still to this day don't know how he thinks it was my fault. He didn't even pay me to work for him. So thinking that it was my fault his shop closed down, he again kicked me out.

I used a bit of my financial aid loads to move into an apartment on the school campus. But again I became depressed, thinking my whole family hated me, I couldn't get a girlfriend that would ever love me and not cheat on me, that I would never have friends or a good job or even be able to get good grades. I started skipping to the point that I just stopped showing up to class altogether, and needless to say, failed most of them. My last semester there, I stopped going altogether and never went back. I ended with a sub 2.0 GPA and multiple failed classes. I now have about 25k$ in student loan debt without even having a degree to get a job good enough to pay it off with.

During the time I was at school and working for my dad, gave my mom a bit of time to realize I really was trying, and she began to become much more caring. She understood that I was really struggling and once more let me come stay with her. Thankfully she did, because while there I met my now fiance who went to a school nearby there.

Fast forward a few years, and me and her have decent stable jobs in a new town, in a new state. Along the way, I've found an all-encompassing passion for physics and astronomy, and feel for the first time actual drive to finish my schooling. It makes me regret everything I've done along the way besides meeting my fiance, and wish that I could do everything all over, but I can't. And now I sit here, wondering if its even possible to get a PhD in physics and astronomy with all the things I've done wrong compiled into my now life. Thinking that I might not ever to achieve that dream because of my many past failures makes me sometimes want to just end it all.

I don't even know where to begin to finish my studies - I know credible schools won't take me with the grades and attendance record I've gotten, and the community colleges around here either don't have the programs I'm looking for and even if they do, I don't know if they'll even add up to me getting a bachelor's from a reputable school since by next year I'll have 3 years worth of credits amounting to nothing; I have a sum of 2 years of business classes combined with extracurriculars, so would going to community college mean I'm starting all over? Let alone going on for a PhD somewhere even better. Why would anyone ever accept me with my record as a PhD candidate when as of now I'm pretty sure no one reputable would even consider me a BS candidate. Even if it was possible to line everything up perfectly, I wouldn't graduate with my PhD until I was almost 40. That in itself is discouraging enough.

So here I sit, lost, depressed, in debt with no degree and no foreseeable future that I can see lining up for myself because of my past mistakes and failures. I really need advice from anyone who can offer it. I finally found something in life I'm honestly 100% passionate about, and am so afraid its too late and that I've messed my life up beyond repair - please help me find how I can achieve my dream despite all the things I've done wrong in my life.",college,"Trying to get my life together at 26, and fear I might have messed it up too much already.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8blqbt/trying_to_get_my_life_together_at_26_and_fear_i/,1523507981.0

My parents are about the furthest thing from wealthy so I'm responsible for all of the cost. I want to major in software engineering. I've built computers since I was 11 and have always loved tinkering with them. My experience is mainly with hardware, but I have a strong desire to learn software. I've worked at an independent computer company, but I just built computers. I can't code or do anything useful to most companies out there. So I need to go back to school.

Can I get loans to support myself while I go to school? 

Is that even a viable option?

TL;DR - I tried to go to a 4 Year State College. 
First semester, 3.8 GPA. 
Second semester, &gt;2.5. 
Third semester, 1.3-- a letter stating that I am in terrible academic standing and that my FASFA has been revoked.

I've been out for almost a full semester and now I want to go back to a community/online college to get a nursing degree. What do I do? 


Long Version: 

I graduated high school in 2016. I was in the top 10% of my class, graduated with high honors, and an overall GPA of around 3.9. I went to college directly after high school and drowned myself in my degree, which was Music Education. 

At this college, it was recommended first-time freshmen take no more than 18 hours a semester for the first two years, and first-time first-generation freshman take no more than 16 hours a semester for the first two years (this was me). 

Due to being a musician, this was overridden for me and I was enrolled into 23 credit hours my first semester--not including 15 required hours of solo practice a week, 3 hours of practice with my instructor, and the 8 hours of marching practice a week that also accompanied a football game every Thursday and every second Saturday or so. The second semester, I was enrolled in 25 credit hours--marching practice now replaced with concert hours, which equaled out to about the same. Then there's the usual college things, such as homework from gen-ed's and attempting to have some sort of social life (my whole time there I made three friends because I just didn't have the emotional strength to add partying/hanging out). 

And I KNOW this may not seem like a lot to some people, but it killed me. I'm a perfectionist and I try to be the best I can be, and I wanted to live up to the standards that were expected of me as a musician. My first semester I was told I was the best freshman the college had seen in years. Then I lost my grip on what mattered, and I just stopped caring. Stopped going, stopped trying, stopped playing. Something in my brain just snapped. I still can't listen to classical music without feeling sick. I tried to switch majors to Gen Psych my third semester there, took all online courses so I could stay away and work at my own pace, but there was a bunch of external things happening at that time and college just wasn't in the books--so, I left halfway through the semester.  

However, this isn't the point. I want to change my life around now and start looking towards something that is better. I want to get my LPN licensure and eventually my RN. But, I'm afraid that I may have ruined my chances. I still have a $10,000 hold on my account at the previous college, plus about $10,000 in debt to the government. I never officially dropped out of my college, but they sent me an exit package just a couple days ago. 

What are my best options? What're my next steps? Do I have to pay off my debts first? Could I possibly write a letter to someone, somewhere, explaining what happened and provide them with my high school transcripts and maybe just have those semesters... removed?

I'm proud to be here, but I don't know if I'm happy to be here. I'm not sure if I'm unhappy with the university or if it's a mental health thing.

Long post, so here is the tl;dr:
**TL;DR: I'm not sure if my motivations and goals fit in with those of my school. I feel like I'm breaking my back and headed nowhere. It's like I'm headed in circles. I don't know if it is a personal issue, a personal issue that is being made worse by my school, or my school.

I’m just tired of culture, having to worry about beating the curve and studying all the time. Another thing about the school is that it is so “no days off”. You can take a day off, but you’ll have to work your ass off to get back. It’s like you have to pay to just take a Saturday off with friends. And I would like to spend every Saturday doing some volunteer thing. I can't even enjoy spring break because I feel like I'm wasting my time not studying. You can’t even take a day off to enjoy your hobbies. I’d like to go hiking and even camping in the state park but god knows I don’t have time for that. It’s like my life is on pause. I know college is about academics—I’m not saying that it shouldn’t be. It’s just I can’t with a good mind take a day off and relax. I dislike my school's atmosphere of competition, grades over everything (even well being), and a bad grade = you didn’t study / you aren’t intelligent. Other students agree that there is a stressful, highly academics-focused culture at the school.

 I like that my school has interesting classes and passionate students. I just can’t help but feel different from the students here. I feel like a dumbass here. I don’t know if my ideas are/motivation is appreciated. I want to be somewhere that I have time to volunteer and do extracurriculars and develop my hobbies and have a job or internship. I realize there are people at my school who are able to successfully juggle the academics and manage to have an internship and hobbies, but I don’t know if I’m one of those people. So far that would be impossible for me. I am so stress sensitive. I freeze up and I feel stupid and like I won’t amount to anything when I’m stressed. And it seems like this school and the students here run off of it. How much time and emotional energy I’m putting into a light workload (14 credits) of comparatively easy classes, I just don’t know if being very involved in volunteering and having a job or internship is possible for me at this school.

Internships and jobs are essential to future job prospects. My alright grades and the school's name won’t be enough to get me a job after graduation. They don’t show whether or not I am competent in the real world or a job environment.

I don’t want to be some big-name, famous, world-class whatever like many of the students here. That just doesn't motivate me. I feel disconnected from my peers in that way. I want to be a mom, be involved in my community and things I feel are meaningful, and be a teacher or a counselor or maybe a psychologist or something like that. I want to help people. I don’t care about notoriety or working for a Fortune 500 company or having my own Wikipedia page or making six figures. I wonder if I’m breaking my back working towards other people’s dreams and the dreams my parents have for me. I’m giving up things I enjoy, like improving and exploring my hobbies and interests and involving myself in causes that I find meaningful. I wonder if that’s even necessary. I want to do extracurriculars that let me work with kids, environmental things with the Bay or the state parks, clubs advocating for and interacting with people experiencing homelessness. I extract so much of my drive and internal sense of meaning from volunteering and involving myself in causes and I don’t have time for that. So far I've had no time for volunteering or anything of the sort because I've either been busy with work or trying to relax myself. I’m also not sure that my internal drive aligns with that of my school. 

In addition, this and last semester I have beens struggling with my mental health. Disassociation, stress, anxiety, racing thoughts, shaming myself as a lazy, useless buffoon who can't even get out of bed, do a calculus problem, or function like a normal person (In addition, people here tend to act like doing poorly in a class is because you're less intelligent). Some days I would be sitting at lunch with friends and almost break down into tears. Some days I wouldn't go to any of my classes but instead lay in bed, cry, and feel like I wasn't even a real person. Basically every week I have a day that this happens and I freak out about school. I'm very stress sensitive. In high school, I did not have perfect mental health but I am not sure if what I am experiencing now is related to the school or what. I want to do well and succeed. I don't want to breeze by and have everything given to me. I worry that people are chalking up my issues these past two semesters to laziness.

I’m not saying any of this just out of concern for my grades or my mentality, but everything as a whole. I know other freshman here who have struggles some but are doing beautifully. I don’t know why it isn’t clicking for me, but I don’t have four years to decide whether or not it is working. I should also explain that last semester I took one credit under the required amount. Because of this, this semester I am on academic probation. If my grades are not up to par, I will be removed from the university and have one semester to prove I deserve to be here. I am speaking to my advisor, friends, RA, etc. about this, I just want as much input as I can get. Thank you all so much.

As you can probably tell I am a college graduate. I have a degree in journalism, which I received in 2009 at the age of 22 (I'm 31 now). Unfortunately, this was around the same time the recession hit its peak, and job opportunities were few and far between (which any journalism or other media - related graduate will tell you today). After a year of searching,  I realized I was fighting a losing battle and gave up. Since college I have been steadily employed in the fast food industry (I've been at the same location for six years now where I'm currently a supervisor).  Call me lazy, call me an underachiever, call me whatever you want,  I'm likely inclined to agree with you. I lost my degree years ago in a housefire, but my dad has a copy hanging up in my room at his house. Every time I see it, I just wanna burn it too.

Now, in recent years, I've thought about going back to school after my loans are paid off (another two years tops). It seems natural, after all. However,  then I read about the job prospects for college graduates these days and have second thoughts. Students today have to do twice the amount of work that they did 15-20 years ago in order to find jobs (networking, volunteering, unpaid internships, etc). I've known people who have gone YEARS before they found work in their field. And even then there's no guarantee I'll get a job. Today I live across the road from the same college I attended. Every time I see students coming and going I wanna tell them to get out while they can and stop wasting their lives. 

Academic factors are another thing. I've always struggled with learning new things (I was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder at a young age).  Journalism was one of the few courses for which I had the prerequisites. A lot of the other stuff I might be interested in taking requires grades in stuff I never even took in high school (chemistry, biology, business math) and a lot of them are in the Grade 11-12 levels. If I go through upgrading with my learning difficulties, I have no idea if I could ever wrap my head around that stuff. It all seems so much.

Finally, there's the cost. It's taken me ten years to pay off my current loans, and it's been absolutely mind numbing (hence my usename). If I found a job in my field it might be easier, but even then there's no guarantee. I can't handle watching the past repeat itself.

I feel as though I won't be able to get a good job and that I wasted time and money as I initially did not get into my first choice major and instead pursuing a degree that while I am interested in, is not practical/technical (poli sci).

I understand that there is a lot of time ahead and that advancements can be made, but I feel like I made my life more difficult by not choosing something like accounting or STEM. I also understand that I am going through a sense of entitlement as I am graduating from a top state school, but will likely be working with people who graduated from a lower tier school for similar pay. This is not to say that they are worse, often they are better than me, this is more along the lines of ""why did I choose to go to a top school for a 'bad' major, when I could've gone to a worse school but get accepted into a 'useful' major.""

I've done various internships and had several office jobs but they have been quite general and in my experience it has been difficult to get specific experiences such as through business internship as they may require you to be a business major. So basically, the scenario boils down to: I know how to do a little bit of this and a little bit of that, but I can't say I can tell you the ins and outs of a certain issue.

She has had kind of a rough past and her family's house was evicted back a few years ago and they didn't have a place to stay and have no good family connections, her father never made it though high school and currently works side jobs/ handyman projects to try to make an income and her mother has a drug addiction and has been to rehab and is currently in prison on drug charges again but the father and the rest of the family are not involved in any drug relations. So back to the story they got evicted and ended up moving into a family friends place and the family friend has some mental issues and started verbally and physically abusing them and they had to leave due to that, then they started living in a RV on her step mom's property (forgot to mention it's just her, her father, and her two brothers living together (Freshman and Sophomore I believe)) and they were always doing their part to help pay for staying there and the electricity and water bills and all that stuff and obviously she's still in school so she can only work part time and her father can only get side jobs here and there so there is a small about of income but enough currently for bills and living expenses and her father has bad credit history so she managed to get her family a place of their own to stay under a program that helps family's with low income and stuff like that but she pay's for most of the bills and gets the groceries for the family and helps take care of her brothers and preparing meals since her dad is usually away at side jobs. But once she graduates the program that helped they get the house won't allow her to be living at the house or something about jacking up the prices or whatever since she would be counted as another adult once she graduates so money wise she can't live there after graduation and have her family afford to live there with her so she's basically forced to leave but still wants/needs to make sure her family is okay but at the same time she doesn't have like barely any money saved due to these situations, she needs to find a place to live of her own, she's still in school, she has like no credit history, has no friends who know how to help with all of these circumstances, the school isn't being any help, she's wanting to go to college to try to better herself and try to be able to make it in life but can't afford not to take at least a break year but then her scholarship apparently won't work if she takes a break year. She's just really scared and stressed out and I'm trying to be here for her and help her figure things out but like with all of these circumstances it's hard to figure out what the best thing(s) to do is.

572,_RE_TARDIS,1520210933,/r/college/comments/8222mf/i_would_like_to_warn_you_about_the_possibility_of/,"If you grew up anything like me, a large focus from age 5-18 was the prospect of going to college. Teachers at school would often talk about it. Parents would start to ask you around age 14 which college you'd like to attend. Your parents' friends ask you if you've made your decision and what your major will be. You make your decision. You leave your crying mother in the car as she drives away after dropping you off freshman year. You change your major. You change it again. You revert back to what it was originally. Graduation day comes, you did it! You passed with flying colors, barely scraped by, or did somewhere in the middle. Selfies with your friends group abound at graduation, all of you swearing you'll remain bestest friends for forever until the end of time, no matter what. Now, you're 5 months post-graduation working your 9-5 and it hits you. ""Man, this *sucks*"". What happened?

While it's impossible to nail down specific causes of this phenomenon for everybody, what I can nail down are some near-universal truths that I've came to realize in the 5 years since I have graduated. 

* Number 1: The lifestyle change can be very jarring. 

I can't remember where I saw it, but somebody said ""College is a weird time in your life because you're effectively an unemployed alcoholic but your parents are still proud of you"". I went from not worrying about having to pay for bills, being surrounded by friends, going to one three hour lecture every other day (rest of my classes were online), and partying every weekend to busting my ass at a ""grown up"" job in a new city with very few people that I knew. Post-college can be extra hard if you move to a new city where you don't know many people or if you go to a familiar city but your friends have all moved away. College is something that is so built up for so many people that once it has came and went, the smile quickly fades as you ask yourself ""So I have worked my whole life up to this point for this moment and now that it's over, what do I do?""

* Number 2: Maintaining friendships after college is much more difficult 

When you're in college, all you have time to do is study and hang out with your friends. You have thousands of people around your age that you have something in common with. A surefire way to introduce yourself is to ask somebody what their name and major are. Easy, right? You don't necessarily have this luxury post-college. 

When you graduate from college and move away from your friends, life tends to get in the way. People get boyfriends and girlfriends. People have babies. People get busy with their careers. People find other groups of friends in their town to hang out with. In college, you may have hardly had a choice *but* to make friends. However, afterwards, maintaining friendships can take *a lot* of work. If you're not careful, you can slowly fade away from people who you thought were going to be your life long friends and that can leave you feeling destitute. 

* Number 3: You change A LOT in your 20's (most of the time)

Most people will go to college starting around 18 and graduate when they are 22-25. Zach Braff, who played John Dorian on the TV show ""Scrubs"" has a very profound quote that I agree with whole heartedly. He said ""‎""I have this theory that your body goes through puberty in its teens, and the mind goes through puberty in your twenties."" In my experience, that is SO true. You'll be constantly changing and evolving as you progress through your twenties, your mind catching up with your body. They say that your brain isn't fully developed until you're in your mid-twenties, and I for one can attest to that. As a 26 year old, I am NOT the same person that I was when I graduated a few years ago. I have evolved mentally, physically, and emotionally into a man that any parent would be proud of. However, that comes with a lot of perspective changing and lifestyle-alterations. 

* Number 4: You might realize that the field you selected to study is not the one for you. 

I spent years trying to make law-enforcement type jobs work for me, as a Criminal Justice major (hint; DO NOT STUDY CRIMINAL JUSTICE. Minor in it if you must, but major in something that will give you hard skills such as computer science or accounting). Corrections Officer. Private Investigator. Loss Prevention Detective. I jumped from one position to the next before I came to the conclusion that this field was NOT for me. This depressed the shit out of me because I felt like I was stuck. I did not have any hard skills to show and I was desperate to get out of the field. I remember flying home to visit my parents about 2 years after I graduated. We went out to a Mexican restaurant and I cried at the table because I was so hopelessly destitute about my job situation at that time. Now, through careful maneuvering and by going back to school, I have successfully transitioned into IT and I love it. If you do not like where you are career-wise, change it. It sucks having to start all over again from the bottom, but I am a hell of a lot happier than I was making 3x what I'm making now. 

As I said in the title, this is a story of the *possibility* of post-college depression. I do realize that many people will not experience this, but many people who I have spoken to about the matter have, including myself. 

The very very TL;DR of this post is that life after college is depressing and takes some adjusting to, friendships are something that you have to work at to maintain, and if you find out your major isn't for you, take steps to get out of that field.

My two roommates were randomly matched to me, and we each have our own room. One of my roommates is fine. The other one (who I'll call X), however, is not so fine.

X decided in the first week of school to let his boyfriend (I'll call this one Y) permanently move into our apartment, rent free. X and Y are both extremely loud and obnoxious. They completely trash the kitchen and leave it so dirty that it's almost unusable for days before cleaning it. If I sweep and Swiffer the floors, they manage to get them sticky and dirty again within hours. They don't wear shoes and they leave the shower floor disgusting because of their gross feet that they don't wash. They often shit in the toilet and don't flush it. 

They've somehow even managed to drop used condoms in the hallway.

They're also just quite rude to my girlfriend and I on a regular basis. All this was bad enough, but I'm pretty sure Y has a bad home life and I don't want to be a dick and send him back somewhere unsafe for him so I haven't reported them to the apartment complex.

However, for the past few weeks Y has been loudly snoring every night and I can't sleep because of it. I don't want to wear ear plugs because I get up pretty early most days for classes and I can't risk not hearing my alarm go off.

I've talked to them about these issues several times and it never gets resolved. What should I do?

Note: I eventually started forcing them to each pay a part of the bills, so now it's split into quarters instead of thirds.

Edit: also, long story short, I think they may have secretly brought a pet snake into their room after we said no ",college,"My roommates are becoming unbearable, and I'm just about ready to lose my shit on them.

574,Lowkey_HatingThis,1519879107,/r/college/comments/812o6a/changing_majors_and_havent_been_going_to_class/,"Okay so this might be a long one, so let me start.

Im currently a student at RIT, in the physics major curriculum. I chose physics as far back as 8th grade, through a combination of reading ""a brief history of space and time"" and religiously watching ""through the worm hole "" I really really was interested in astrophysics. This interest wained over time, and eventually when my high school counselors said ""so are you still interested in astrophysics"" I'd just say yes to get done with the meeting. When I got to high school physics, I hated it. It was boring, uninteresting, and all around just awful. This should have been a warning, but I just thought ""oh this is basic stuff I'll get done with in a year and go to what I really want to do"".

Fast forward to this semester and I'm failing UP 1. I don't go to the class, I hate everything about it. I hate the topics, I hate the people, I hate the atmosphere of the classroom, I hate physics. The other math and science classes (such as chem and calc) I deal with and get and can enjoy sometimes, but physics I just can't stand. I haven't gone to a class in 3 weeks. My academic advisor told me to give career services a call, which I will tomorrow. I'm seriously considering changing majors.

The problem? There are three

1.) I have no idea what I want to do in life. I want to enjoy my career to the point where I never want to retire, but I also want to make decent money (nothing extravagant like a million dollars or something, I don't want to be wickedly rich, if I can get 6 figures, I'd be happy). I cannot think of anything, I've never really had a passion for anything. I was fairly smart in school and really had a passion for learning new things. I was good at the sciences and maths, but I really think I excelled I'm history, it was very enjoyable to me and I was able to pass the APUSH test with a 5 without really studying (I'm not bragging, I did awful on the Calc and Chem AP test, and got a 4 on the English).

2. I don't want to leave my school. I love the area, I'm starting to make friends, I have really nice scholarships and grants, and I am considering rushing a fraternity next year. I commute so the price also reduces from their, and this leads me into my third point

3. Emotionally abusive father. My father, to anyone looking at what he's done for me, would call him a saint. He's paid for my two semesters of college (about $18k so far) and is letting me live with him rent free. He's a very seasoned project manager so he makes about $110k a year, so it's not crippling him financially, but I was raised by my mom and we were dirt poor my early life so that amount of money boggles me and I appreciate it dearly. The downside? He treats me like he's a loan shark rather than a father, and he is an extreme alcoholic of 30 years, destroying his mental state. A typical day, hes drunk by 4 pm to the point where he can barely stand and he shouts everything he says. If I forgot to do something (put dishes in dishwasher, put clothes away, etc) he shouts at me, saying I'm a fuck up or even calling me the n- word (I am 100% white). Whenever i say something to him while he's drunk, he immeadiatly forgets, and when he has to tell me something, he forgets he told me and tells me again 10 minutes later, by 8 pm he's asked me the same question about 6 times, getting angrier each time he ask. He accuses me of lying and being lazy, he accused me of taking his pain meds one time, and I thought he was going to hit me because I swore I didn't take them (I literally said ""I've never taken your pills, why would I take your fucking pain meds""). He's 50 and I honestly think he's showing signs of early dimentia I'm 18 close to 19, an adult who works and goes to college, and it's all very demeaning. If I bring up anything about college (say he asks me about a class, and I say ""it's difficult, I think I'm having problems with it"") he will over exageratingly slam his head into his hands, shake his head back and forth, and Huff very loudly, like I'm 5 years old. He will them ask ""you have any idea how much fucking money I'm spending on this? You better"" and then brings up how I better have a paid internship by my third year because he isn't helping past that point. His attitude and abuse stresses me out to the point where I lie about how I'm doing, and will stay on campus or in my room to avoid him. I can't live on campus (don't have the money, especially if he doesn't pay). I came close to vomiting the other day when I saw my failing grade because I worried what he would say (got all A's last semester except for one D in another physics class and he was very mad, saying I was wasting money). If I change majors, especially to something he might not like, not only would I possibly lose his financial support, but a place to live, a mode of transportation (he let's me drive his car, but I pay for the gas and upkeep) and I might be forced to go to a smaller college back home, which would honestly make me just not want to go to college. 

Adding to this, when I was 10 my mom met my future step dad. He and my father are alike in many ways, he would provide me with cash and things like a good parent would if I earned it or was good. However, he was very emotionally abusive, leading to a weird relationship between us 8 years later. A day would not go by where we wouldn't argue, he would always been my ass about something, and never would geniuenly just talk to me. It got better as I got older, but it's really left me with no real male figure I've been able to look up to in my life. Everyone we've ever been around would say ""he treats that kid like shit"" and even my mother acknowledge that she feels sick to her stomach for letting him treat me the way he did. This leads me to believe I'm not being over dramatic about my biological father 


This whole thing is stressing me out, I hate my major and feel trapped. I don't know what I want to do, and I feel like the only person who would really support me is my mother, but she's not financially well off right now and can only provide moral support. Please help

577,the3ieis,1518184050,/r/college/comments/7wdiu3/nervous_about_potential_commuter_life/,"Thank you for reading in advance. I've been nervous about applying to college in New York state for numerous reasons, and most recently after looking into colleges with a higher chance of accepting me, I forgot one obvious thing. Due to my financial situation and my parents not helping with college(and trying to stay as far away from my parents as possible), I'm probably going to have to be a commuter with my own apartment. From what I've heard being a commuter entails having a much harder time making friends than those who actually live on campus, not to mention CUNY schools(meaning schools in nyc specifically) have virtually no social life due to everyone most likely living less than an hour away from the school. I think there is an unspoken understanding or misunderstanding that everyone at CUNYs have friends outside of school, not sure. The few CUNYs that do have residence halls I don't have high enough grades for(2.2-2.3 gpa so college of staten island is a stretch through SEEK, although I haven't looked into SEEK a whole lot).

In regards to SUNYs, I was thinking Plattsburgh, but again due to financial reasons I may need an apartment off campus and again, I'm afraid this complicates things as someone who literally has no friends atm and has struggled to make friends his entire life due to insecurity and other mental health issues. I can't afford to have an even HARDER time making friends and I probably can't afford living on campus unless I had a job, but then I'd have to juggle school, working and socializing and I'm not sure how possible that is.

I have seen some suggestions about making friends as a commuter, including getting a job on campus but im not sure how guaranteed that is, or if it would pay as much as a regular job, and I'd need all the money I can get. I would appreciate any advice or suggestions as to how to tackle this to actually make friends AND do good in school.

I'm currently in my second year of college, at a community college before I transfer over to a University this coming Fall Term. I just moved to a new city a few months ago and live with my girlfriend. I got a job shortly after I moved here at a big corporate restaurant as a server. 

My job in my old town previously was a much smaller, higher class restaurant that I worked at. I really liked my job there. Everyone was motivated, ambitious and had other endeavors going on in their life. My new job isn't like that at all. I can't stand it and I'm not sure if it's the job itself or just having to work and go to school. I'm taking 5 courses which is equivalent to about 20 credits so you can imagine I'm pretty swamped. 

I've gone this far not having to take out loans because I've been working through college and my tuition has been paid with grants. However, once I transfer to the University I will have to take loans and not be able to work since I'll have to do internships during those years, considering it's crucial in order to get a job out of college. 

So, currently I have no debt whatsoever. My question is, should I take out loans during college or work for living expenses? I'm constantly stressed about working enough in order to pay for my bills, but I know that school is priority number one. I'm not enjoying life one bit currently since I'm always stressed out. Once I'm out of college, my degree/career is a very high stressed environment with a lot of hours so I'll be stressed then. 

I guess the ultimate question: Should I take out loans to enjoy life a little bit now? Or should I continue to work through college in order to stay debt-free for as long as possible?

There are three parts to my situation and I'll leave a TL;DR below.

Part 1:
I'm an aviation student in my sophomore year and I came to my school to earn a BS Professional Pilot degree. Because of extenuating circumstances, in my almost two years here I haven't flown with the school one bit and I decided to say fuck it and fly off campus. I only have two gen eds left after this quarter and I'm really doubting what I actually want to do in my life. My motivation and confidence have gone down tons over the summer and that didn't help since I might have depression but I've never been diagnosed for it, so now I've gone from what in my terms was a horrendous 2.89 GPA freshman year for me to now having a 1.9 GPA this quarter.

Part 2:
I'm currently enrolled in an 18 credit quarter about halfway through. I have a morning gen ed class that isn't for my major that uses this program called Top Hat where I was late on getting the materials set up for because their activation card doesn't pay for the whole thing and forced me to go out of pocket. I missed a few assignments and I knew there was no late work accepted and that already brought my max quarter grade to a C-. Well I went in and shot the professor an email on how to access assignments and he never responded. I'm in an auditorium class for this one at 10 AM and I found out that I was being locked out of assignments on the program so I couldn't see due dates.

Part 3: The rest of my family will be moving to New Mexico in June and I'll be an 18 hour drive from the new home from where I'm at now. I want to transfer, but my cumulative GPA is only 2.45 through 4 quarters, and I don't think anyone will take anyone in my current motivational shape.

I believe I'm on my way towards getting kicked out of school but at the same time I've become nihilistic about everything. *Today I slept through my alarms and didn't wake up until 3 PM after I was supposed to present in my afternoon class.* Tying back into the first part of this post, I stopped going to the morning class altogether and I finally have been able to access my grade through the Top Hat program and it shows a 0%. I don't know what to do, but I know I need help. 

TL;DR and questions:

1. Should I drop the morning general education class I can't seem to figure out and pay the fee to drop or will it count my grade being halfway through the quarter and continue with a fail grade and not be able to transfer?
2. Since I only have the two general education classes left and I don't know what I want to do, would it be wise to take a quarter off and rethink what I want to do with my life against my parents wishes?
3. Should I see a school counselor about my my issues regarding motivation and confidence? Could you give me advice on how I should get motivation? Getting a job has been hard for me but is that the route I should take?

I live in the state of Indiana and chose not to apply to any out-of-state colleges since I want to stay in the same state as my family and friends do (less struggle to go home when visiting)...money is also not an issue for me whatsoever. 

Currently, as of right now:

* IUS (Indiana University Southeast)
* IUPUI (Indiana University-Purdue University- Indianapolis) 
* BSU (Ball State University)

have all accepted me. However, I'm still waiting for a decision from IUB (Indiana University-Bloomington). Which side note is my #1 choice and will go there if they do accept me.

I really want to attend an Indiana University branch school, so BSU is kind of off the list...but not totally excluded. Just because I've had family members go to all of the Indiana University branch schools I've listed above and have a good idea of what my time at each school will be like.

I would love to go into computer science and possibly minor or double major in astronomy. I've also really thought about special education since I peer tutor for special needs students at my school, however, I feel if it would be a really good fall back option if I decided somehow that CS (and astronomy) wasn't right for me. All subjects I know I am interested in and would reach a great GPA, which nowadays matters more than the major itself. 

What I'm struggling to figure out is which school will best suit me and what I want to go for.

* I do want to move away from my area, which is why IUPUI, BSU, and IUB are favorable. If I attend IUS, since my family lives practically outside of the campus...it would be really dumb to pay for a dorm or apartment for myself.
* If I go to IUS, I will transfer to IUB after my freshman year 100%.
* If I attend IUPUI or BSU, I discussed with my parents that I will stay there until I graduate. I thought about heading to IUPUI then transferring to IUB, but my parents opposed to the idea of it.
* Clearly, IUPUI and IUB favor with my desired major(s). However, I've heard that IUPUI's CS program is superior to IUB's...but I've heard the same opinion vice versa. This would be my only reason I wouldn't go to IUB if I was accepted.
* I would be kind of disappointed if I went to BSU instead of any Indiana University branch school. I just can't see myself going there. The only reason I could see myself going there is for special education.

I hope someone who reads this who knows more than I do can help me with my decision making. Be even better if you know or have attended or do attend any of the schools I mentioned!

P.S: All that really matters to me is the quality of education and social life I get from my college career. So whichever choice I make should favor both.

But the short version is I get $800 a month to be a ""full-time student"" (not dependent on grades)and my tuition is payed for by the school. This being said, I don't want to go to school. I have absolutely no drive to be there. I don't think I've been in class for the past 2 weeks. The only reason I'm still enrolled and haven't dropped classes is because I can't find a job. I'm living off that $800 a month (bills, rent, food, etc.) I'm failing 3/4 of the classes I'm enrolled in and will be failing the 3rd if I don't get homework done by the weekend and start showing up to class (participation based)... But I really don't care. I'm focused on finding a job and living life... 
So what do I do? Do I grow up and start focusing on classes I couldn't care less about and try desperately to save my failing grades? Or keep looking for a job so I can hopefully drop them eventually?

583,NewContemporary,1517324899,/r/college/comments/7u1m93/mental_health_or_intership/,"Hello Reddit,

  I am a junior in college . I am an anthropology major and so far have had two paid internships in the field. The first was close to my house and I made my schedule in a certain way where it wasn't an issue and I was only allowed 10/15 hours a week. 
.
Now, I have this other internship in the city closer to my campus and have had it for about a year now. It's a job researching and writing and I'm an assistant to my boss who gives me these assignments where I'm unfamiliar with the subject matter and I have to research and after that, write. I can do it it's just now I have taken my class load down from five classes to three this semester to balance everything more. Also last semester when I was taking five classes I barely made it by and simply just strived to pass my classes. However my mental health was out of whack and I was constantly depressed and then would have anxiety and used heavy drinking on the weekends to cope with everything . ...
.
This semester I'm trying to be nicer to myself and not push myself to the edge of giving up on school altogether as I have already come this far. So like I said , I am taking three classes. 
. 
However , these classes are now heavily discussion based and require me to actually do the reading to get points in the class. And the readings are pretty heavy and not always digestible . Not to mention, I actually want to understand what the fuck I am learning in class and remember it to a certain extent. I think honestly my profs were nice to me and passed me to a certain extent because I kept in communication with them about everything but last semester a ton of my assignments were late or I was given an extension. 
.
I don't drive right now as school is plenty expensive on its own without a car And I only get loans . So I take the bus and I have to be there with the way my schedule is this semester at 6 am to get there by seven then take the bus from work at 11 to get to school by 12. However, I have no classes on Fridays so I can actually work a full shift, as I do on breaks then. 
.
I'm seriously losing my shit right now cause although that works in theory in real life that's too much because of just having time to work out / sleep/ eat/ read / do homework takes a bit of time. I'm trying to take better care of myself this semester and the semester has just started and I'm already feeling myself get into this space that I really don't like. .
.
I just emailed my boss and asked if I can work remotely at school at my breaks between classes , and after school, then come into the office on Fridays to present my work and also to work one full shift then . This is really feasible because there's no real reason for me to have to be at work other than her seeing my physical body working. But with writing you have to be in a good headspace to write and when I have to commute in the early morning and fill like shit from reading and sleep deprived I can't wrote as is so my productivity is low. 
.
I work best around the afternoon when the gears have already been turning for a bit . And I am in a space where I can write....... Being in an office where people are gossiping and things or answering calls, etc. Is a hard environment for me to work in. 
.
If my boss doesn't take my proposal I'm not sure what to do . I like the job and it's a good job I'm not willing to just like lose my shit though to keep it. I live at home still and my parents support me for the greater extent of my needs except for when I have the money to help out ( books/ I buy my own food/ buss pass/ phone bill/ help with groceries for them / pay people I carpool with, etc) oorrr last semester I spent a lot of money on alcohol but now as I have been working out more and using that and yoga as an outlet and also lightening my load of classes ; I have lessened the drinking and now hardly do it at all unless it's a social thing and I find myself there . ( It's hard to get in shape when you drink) .

I just don't want to get in that dark space again.... ",college,Mental health or Intership,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7u1m93/mental_health_or_intership/,1517342899.0
584,StabilizedDarkkyo,1516679448,/r/college/comments/7sbp4z/is_there_still_hope_for_me_to_attend_college_long/,"I have attended three semesters of college as a degree-seeking student. I didn't fuss about it, but near the end of the semester, my family got an eviction notice that freaked me out like crazy, as my step-dad wasn't paying rent and was misusing our money. I was already struggling as these last few years of my life have been insane, but we were able to survive. Around that time my Mom and step-dad started their separation/divorce. It left me frazzled at the end of the semester, and I ended up getting an A, C, and D. Not terrible, but I got an academic warning. I told myself it was just me being lazy, and that the next semester I would do better.

Then, spring semester of 2017 came and life got insane again, even more so this time. My grandfather committed suicide by shooting himself in the face during spring break, my step-father attempted suicide multiple times from the beginning to end of the semester, my brother got put into inpatient treatment for suicidal activity, and we realized how screwed over we were financially from my stepdad's misuse of our money. Things became tight financially, so I continued my student job I started the first semester of school, but I noticed my performance had dropped significantly from the previous semester, both in school and work. I got an academic probation, seeing that my GPA dropped under a 2.0 to a 1.66. But I was able to get an airline ticket as a prize in a lottery at work, so I thought I'd be able to relax by seeing my father and his side of the family down in Michigan. Heck, the next semester would be great if I came back relaxed! So I booked a trip right before the fall semester started.

During summer, my stepfather overdosed on Ambien twice, strangled himself with a belt to passing out and tried suffocating himself with a bag. Finally, he was told to move out after he was hospitalized. This constant calling of 911 and being afraid there would be a dead body in our house kept everybody in the house on edge. Everybody was stressed, anxious, and terrified. Thankfully I was able to stay at another house for a couple days here and there when I needed to, but the stress still got to me. Then, during the trip to see my father, it turned out that he wasn't what we thought he was. I had brought my brother with me, and two days before we left, my father started verbally assaulting my brother over how he'd die if he were ever to be robbed, how my mother raised him wrong, how he would have raised us to be good christian children, how he wanted to take my little brother and force him to stay there. My father mocked him for having an online girlfriend, telling him he should be screwing every girl possible, told him that he was a pussy that needed to learn how to kill, and so forth. I hid in a room trying to stay away from the fight, but my stepmom dragged me out and started screaming at me at how i had told my mom that she was abusing my little brother, how I was totally conspiring against her when I was only 11. We later went to go on a boat ride, but on the way my step father screamed at us for being non-religious, that he was ashamed of us bieng his blood, that I was a pussy-footing failure, that neither of us woudl get anywhere in life, and finally that we better not tell our mother, as telling our mother would get him pissed off, and he told us that everybody that pisses him off would no longer exist on earth. So basically he threatened to kill us. So on the boat, my little brother called my mom while I kept a look out, and the next day our relatives in the town kept us away from our father as much as they could without raising suspicion. Then, past security at the airport we met up with my mother, where our father couldn't see, and went home. We were scarred from that, and we went to school full of stress and fright. I went to the counseling center at the university after breaking down when trying to tell my teacher what was wrong with me, but they said I was a bit too extreme to me and referred me to the psychological counseling center, who didn't accept me as I wasn't suicidal. So, I went to my former childhood therapist. My brother ended up dropping out. I got academically disqualified. 

I for some odd reason thought there was still hope that I could go to school this semester, but I wasn't able to. Turned out they removed me from the degree program, so I tried as a non-degree seeking student. Turns out that as a non-degree seeking student, I had no access to any of the loans or student aid I heavily relied upon, as my family has been spending pretty much every cent on the financial mess we were left in. I called the financial aid center and tried to see what I could do, and they said my only option was to go to class and pay out of pocket or go get a SAP appeal done. So, I emailed my academic counselor about it. This morning I got an email saying that I was pretty much removed from the university. The SAP appeal was only allowed for degree-seeking students, but seeing as how I became non-degree seeking a few days prior, I was disqualified from that. 

I have no financial way to go to college without begging for money from my father or getting a job, which would interfere with university especially since I can't even drive yet. So, I'll have to take the next semester or two off to raise up money to go to college, but my loans only give me a grace period of six months, so I am afraid I won't have enough money to go to classes before that is up. Is there anything I can do to still go to college, or do I have to just drop out for the semester and work until I can afford it again?

So far I've been there for a year (I transferred in) and I'm considered to be a senior on campus. Last semester (Fall 2017) I was discouraged from taking out the Sallie Mae loan by my father (since its a high interest loan) and told to apply for a federal loan from Canada and that I could pay off the rest of the money in installments since the Canadian loan would only cover half my tuition. I had explained this to my advisor who said that that would be fine. So I go through the semester applying for my federal loan and trying to contact my advisor for when it would be the best time to enroll in a payment plan and I can't reach her all semester. Near the end (like a week before the semester ends) she tells me I can't enroll in a payment plan because I'm an international student and by their policy I'm not allowed to pay in installments. She literally demanded that I pay the remaining tuition around 7K in full. Neither my parents, husband, nor myself have that kind of money laying around. She also told me that she could have worked out a payment plan for me if I had come earlier in the semester (which I had tried doing, I was completely upfront with her about my situation) I was forced to apply for the Sallie Mae loan and my advisor told me that once it was approved I would be re-instated for classes for the upcoming Winter semester (since they were dropped due to the fact that I had a 7k balance). 

However after the loan was approved my advisor was MIA again and the classes were not re-instated. I caught up with her after New Years on Jan 3rd and she basically told me she couldn't put me into new classes unless if I signed up for a payment plan or paid Winter semester's tuition in full. I asked her how to apply for the payment plan and then she got all weird and wen't ""how much can you afford for a down payment"". It was all super sketchy and there was no paper trail of any kind regarding this ""payment plan"". I walked out of her office and applied for Sallie Mae again for the Winter semester. The next day my advisor was MIA again so I had to contact her manager who removed the tuition hold off of my account but said it was too late in the semester to register for classes by myself and that my advisor had to do it. 

 I told the manager which classes I required and she said she forwarded the information to my advisor and that she would get it done. I emailed the advisor for confirmation and received an automated message that she was gone. Her manager then told me that she would be working on my issue from home. 3 days have passed and my classes have not been re-instated. I emailed the manager like 50 times and all I got was ""she is working on it"" or ""she can get you scheduled"". No body is telling me where my advisor is in the scheduling process. No body is telling me when or if these classes can get scheduled. It's Saturday night right now and school starts on Monday. I have no idea what to do.

588,GeometrysockS,1515186845,/r/college/comments/7oed6j/applied_to_local_cc_without_moms_knowledge_how_do/,"Hey there,

I'm transferring to my local community college for the spring semester. I was planning to go to my state's flagship university, but that's not happening anymore. Let me tell you why. :/

Turns out my mom has no money to help me with my education. Money was tight when I applied to transfer from my former university; I must have spent about $500 just to apply to three schools. When I got into my top choice, I was so excited. My mom said she'd do anything to make it work. I was willing to get multiple jobs to fund my education.

This is where I shouldn't have listened to her. My mom has a chronic spending problem; she buys things she doesn't need, and then we end up struggling to pay rent and bills. This is how we lost our house back in the day, and now it's affecting my education. She owes my aunt $100k; I told her my situation and now she's livid. Blindly, I let my mom take all of the money I had earned from working, scholarships, etc. She would make me feel guilty for refusing to hand it over, said I was ""dumb and selfish"" for insisting I save. I fear this will affect my brother, as well, who will be starting college this fall.

Don't get me wrong; my mom is not a bad person. I know she cares for my siblings and I very much. She just lost her husband, and we lost our dad, in December 2016. I think her spending problem gotten worse because of grief. She's apologized to me for blowing through the money, but I just can't trust her with finances anymore. Not after this mess.

This will be the fourth institution I'm planning on attending. It's been a god-damn train wreck. Started with Penn State, then my former school for a semester, then the university upstate, and now CC. I'm done with the games, the constant headache, the embarrassment; I'm taking matters into my own hands now.

Yesterday, I secretly applied to my local community college. I've discussed attending it with my mom several times. She insists I'm ""too smart"" for CC, and that I'd be ""wasting my time"" by going. I already owe my former school $4000, which I'm probably going to pay off with a private loan in my name. Otherwise, we'll be stuck paying them for the next two years, and they won't release my transcript. She promised I could attend the university upstate in the fall, but I don't believe her. She had no problem telling me I couldn't go upstate ten days before I was supposed to leave. I'm tired of her telling me, ""sorry, you can't do this anymore.""

I'm probably going to end up paying for my own education. Going to CC will be a great start for me. If I work my ass off, I could end up paying little to nothing after CC. I just need to tell her, but I don't know how to do so without having her fly off the handle. It's ironic, considering she, my dad, and my aunt all went to CC.

Am I overreacting? Anyone else ever been in a situation like mine? How did you handle it?

I got a 3.2 GPA, not terrible but not outstanding, just average. Didn't do any extracurricular or sports. I recently decided I would like to go to college, however, there are a few things I have yet to figure out, one being whether to stay in the US or go somewhere in EU. I don't expect to get into anything prestigious like Oxford or Cambridge, but I am fascinated with foreign cultures and would love to immerse myself and learn new languages.  
  
I have always wanted to travel and after graduating my plan was to backpack Europe and parts of Asia, but I am still in the process of saving for that. I have been struggling to decide what I like to do but I think I figured out that I would really like to do something physics-based or astronomy. However, those don't have much application to a wide range of careers that would pay well and I don't have much money. I'm not exactly after money but I would at least like to be able to afford to pay off debts and live comfortably afterwards. Two other options that would probably be better for making more money would be finances or engineering which I don't think I'd mind doing.

I was told when I first met with financial aid that my first year would be about $25,000 but after my first year I could expect to pay about $16k if I applied for in state residency and tuition.

Well now into my sophomore year I was foolish and just took out the loans I needed without really paying attention. While looking more in depth at it going into spring semester, I am still paying $26,000 a year even though I have become an RA which takes $10,000 out of my cost per year (which I did instead of applying for in state since it is a difficult process). This is because my tuition has gone up $6,000 a year to upperclassmen tuition (because of AP credits making it seem like I am an upperclassmen credit hour wise even though I still have 2.5 years left of school) and the school no longer giving me a $4,000 scholarship due to the school deciding to give out less money this year. Both of these things were not things I knew about in advanced.

So even though I took action to take off the $10,000 a year to make school affordable for me, the school has made changes setting me back to the $26,000 a year. 

I feel like I can't keep going to school and accepting the debt that caused me not to go to my dream school. I am not sure what to do.

Started college at the start of being 19 (I was born late and parents forgot to enroll me in school for a year), and got out by my mid to late 20 with an Associates in Software Development (finished fast because I took more classes and never failed once). Learned a lot more in that University then I probably would in other Universities that would force you to take General Ed classes. The Problem? MY FUCKING SCHOOL HAD DIFFERENT ACCREDITATION (and the accredited institution is shutting down). And I can't afford to pay for the Bachelors (its ridiculously expensive and without accredidation I can't get a federal loan). Worse still, I am already 10k in debt. The only benefit I see is that I indeed learn quite alot about Software Development and have a good prospect of job offerings (Uni has connections with companies).

Yet, now none of my credits will transfer to any other public school of my choosing and now I have to start from scratch. Now I am going to Community at age 21 and won't probably finish until I am 25 (that is if I manage to not repeat ANY classes). I feel so miserable right now that most people are one or two years ahead of me, even those that are younger than me! Some have even finished their bachelors and are only a year older then me!!

I never did anything that would jeopardize my future (drinking, drug addiction, police arrest) but this one was perhaps the greatest blow to me personally as i felt I was doing everything right but instead wasted almost two years of my already accelerating young adult life...Whats perhaps worse is that I perhaps missed out on the most exciting part of College life (dorms, state college, school events, friends) because of me not being assertive enough to choose the college of my choosing.

I worked a part time job while going to school for the past year and a half. I am finishing a semester early in community college because I took 5-6 classes a semester and summer classes. I was working towards my business administration degree so I could transfer early to university. Well, I am doing just that. Have a 3.8 gpa so far but I have big problems. I never got any financial aid because my dad makes about 69K a year. The bad thing is that when I put home much income he gets in total, he is already getting money apparently from his 401k for retirement. So basucally the income hes makes but double that is how much he apparently gets all because of retirement. He hasn't retired yet but apparently he is already getting that money, since hes very old. I get no aid whatsoever and to go to the college and live in a decent dorm (the dorms are very expensive because the public uni is a big school) it would be about 15k. I am getting a loan for about 12.5k but I can't pay off 4 times that amount for the next 4 semesters. I had like my first nervous breakdown slash panic attack yesterday because my mom was getting mad at me in the car for getting a loan with her as a cosigner but she obviously has no idea how it is almost impossible it is to not get a loan since i get no financial aid. My dad was also diagnosed with stage 1 cancer about 5 weeks ago. I want to know what I can do to get money for school. I had plans to pay for college by joining the Navy after i graduated senior year of high school but decided i would work hard and just do community college but the loans would probably be hard to pay off after school. Yesterday my mom did feel bad and said I deserved the loan the most out of my 2 sisters since I have worked hard, have no car, work part time but some weeks full time and finished a semester early but I said I was going to not go and probably join the navy reserves or active duty. I don't know why but a part of me is scared to do it. I think you only get the g.i. if you commit to 6 yrs in reserves or 4 yrs. Active duty. I am debating between the 2 options for military ir what other options there may be. I kind of don't want to join but at the same time i think the exciting thing is that I can travel wherever I am assigned and have experience i otherwise wouldn't get but the commitment in the military makes me feel like it would be demanding.

    Painting the picture..

Single male, 30 years old. Living in central Arkansas. No kids. **No debt**. I went to college when I was 18 years old after being in the top echelon &amp; AP classes in all of my junior through high school years and went to college for 2 years, but only got credit for 1 year of classes cause I withdrew or failed the others. I was always the shy kid growing up and had only a couple of friends. Never went to a party, never dated, nothing. College gets here and I have my first drink. I move in with now 4 friends in a 2 bedroom apartment on campus. I GM a chain of video game stores and rack up a good 50 hours a week, while taking 12 hours of classes. Long story short, something had to break and I never had a direction in school. I was going to do Film, but the school didn't offer that program yet. Admittedly, I just went to college cause I was a dumb 18 year old and we are all sent to college with the idea of ""Figure It Out"". Thankfully, instead of spending more thousands of dollars on a degree that I'm not quite sure would have financially got me anywhere, I dropped out. But, that was after passing all of my classes the last semester to get myself out of academic probation. So, left in good standing.

-
Spent the next few years going from job to job after the owner of the video game franchise fucked up his personal finances with his 8 businesses and had to declare bankruptcy. I paid off the $15,000 I owed the university for my fucking shit up. Found a fantastic bartending position at 24 years old. Started making around $40k a year. Which is a ton for a single, bachelor guy without any responsibilities and in a very low cost of living state. So, kind of partied for the rest of my 20's and went on vacations. Saw a ton of shows, went to Bonnaroo 11 times (couple of times as a teenager), traveled, did cool shit. Had a good time.

    Now..

I'm 30. Don't want to bartend the rest of my life FOR SURE. Hate working until 3AM. I hate most of the 21 year olds that come in the bar. There's no career path with this job, I've been at the glass ceiling for 5 years now and I DEFINITELY don't want to manage. And one day I want to start a family. Also, I'm overrrr the party life. I hardly touch drinking. I went almost a year without drinking recently (damn 30th birthdays). I'm just ready to be..... a 30 year old, I suppose.

* Time to get shit done, son.

So, I enrolled back at my old university. Pretty big school. They accepted me back immediately. I was looking at Computer Science initially after a frustrating 6 month span of redditing and talking to people and pulling all of my hair out. I was enjoying some courses on Team Treehouse. But, I ended up talking to some very like minded friends who urged me to do MIS (Management Information Systems) instead. Same job path, same career trajectory, same pay (perhaps a little lower ceiling on pay, but I don't need to make $200k a year), but wayyy more people skills involved (which I excel at) and business classes instead of advanced math classes in the course. Still learn programming. My buddy's company literally just hired 2 guys for the same job. One was CS. One was MIS. Same job. Same pay.
-
MIS &amp; CS opportunities are growing substantially in Arkansas. If you're not from Arkansas, you probably think this place is redneck and backwoods. But, if you grew up here, you know it's an amazing place with an awesomeeee low cost of living. I love the place. Also, looks like it is very likely an Amazon warehouse will be moving in just 25 minutes away from me in the next few years. Which could line RIGHT up with me finishing up my degree. Could be perfect. 
-
Now, I'm not going to lie. A big reason why I chose MIS, outside of the confidence of succeeding in the field, is the pay. You don't walk off that stage making less than $60k a year. That's almost twice what I'm doing now and that's just starting pay. 
-
I'm going to the University of Central Arkansas. Which has an excellent program for MIS. 
-
    Now, the financial stuff..
My first semester back, I'm taking just 3 classes to get back in the groove. Microeconomics to get it out of the way cause it's required for MIS, Biology for a gen ed, and Nutrition for another gen ed that's easy to pad the GPA stats. I signed up for the best professors &amp; classes literally 2 minutes after the 5 AM window opened for picking classes. I'm not fucking this shit up like my dumb ass 18 year old self.
-
I'm still at my bartending job. Despite wanting to move on with my life, I thankfully work with some of my best friends and I make good money. Also, most importantly, because of my seniority, they can work with my class schedule. So, this is what I have devised:
-
    Class Day Schedule:
    - 9:30AM-10:40AM
    - 12:15PM-1:30PM
    - 2:40PM-3:55PM

    MON: Off
    TUE: Class Day Schedule
    WED: 3PM-5PM Lab
    THU: Class Day Schedule &amp; Work @ 9PM-3AM
    FRI: Work either Double or 8PM-3AM
    SAT: Work either Double or 8PM-3AM
    SUN: Work 8PM-3AM

- I wanted to make sure I wasn't getting off at 3 AM the night of having to get to class at 9:45AM.
- Thursdays are gonna suck, it's possible I can occasionally work those. But, Scott Steiner math suggests I Don't Be A Pussy and just red bull it up and work that Thursday anyways.
-
    Work Info:
    With those 4 days of working, I should be able to pull $600-$700 a week.
    Knock off one night and move it to 3 days of working, $500-$600 a week.

    Utilities
My rent is around **$550** a month after utilities splitting a 1,500 square foot home with 2 roommates. Being older and having experience with having up to 7 roommates at the same time, I just can't do more than 2. Preferably, I'd be by myself, but the world is not perfect. Oh, and I'm a 5 minute drive away from campus.

* ***Food cost is around $400ish*** as I also do some bodybuilding and the occasional dates with the lady.

* The rest of my bills between health insurance, phone bill, gym, netflix, Adobe Suite (sidework), etc is about **$430 a month**. Sooooo..

* Bills + Rent/Utilities + Food = **roughly $1,400 a month**

* Working 4 days with stacking one work night a week on class schedule, I should be able to roughly expect **$2,400 a month.**

**Leaves $1,000 aside** for anything in the world that could happen. Life shit. I also have a girlfriend. She is very supportive and awesome and is more frugally minded anyways. So, we can have just as good of a time hanging out at home vs. going out often.

    But Student Loans Now...my main inquiry..
I'm expecting to be able to get grants and possibly scholarships next semester in the fall after I get my GPA up and I have this time of the year to apply.

* I can get 2 loans with my university. Subsidized which will cover my tuition this semester ($3,100). Along with an unsubsidized loan for $5,300. I obviously need the subsidized loan so I can have my tuition covered. The unsub I'm wrestling around with.
* In all honesty, I'm not too concerned about getting into debt with student loans, because I will be increasing my earnings from **$40k a year** full time before college *(which, the timeline left on that job is probably only 2 years max and I do not want to continue that line of work)* to starting at **$60k a year**. Possibly up to **$80k a year** and then with some years of working, I could get up to over **$100k** easily.

So, $40k-$50k in student loan debt seems more of a Spend Money to Make Money situation to me.

* If I took both the sub &amp; unsub loans. That would also allow me to not worry about work. Be able to give shifts up when I need to for extra studying/project time. As, it has been 10 years since I've been in school. Now, I'm serious about it and want to be at the top of my class in every class. This is my future in my hands.

* Taking the $5,300 unsub loan would give an extra $1,000+ a month during school that could be used to cover all of my living expenses.

Then, the money I make at work? I save.

* Obviously, I'm taking on debt. So, I'm not exactly saving. But, I save that money until I graduate, then I can put an immediate HUGE dent into my student loans. And, I also have the money for anything that comes up, such as moving into a new place. Car breaking down. Etc, etc. Which brings me toooooo...

*      Should I buy a house?**

I currently live in a rent house. It's $1,150 a month before utilities that I split with 2 other roommates. I've already lived in the same city for 10 years. And with school, I'm locked in for another 3 years. 

* My credit score is 717.

Of course, that's before the loans. That's right now. After rent and utlities (I pay more for the bigger room with its own bathroom), I'm averaging $550 a month. Sometimes a little lower, sometimes a little higher. I could see me and my girlfriend eventually wanting to move in together. 

* My lease is up in May and then it moves to month to month. 

My current situation is fine. But, staying here for school the next 3 years, rent minus utilities....just rent, is gonna cost me **$15,000+.**

* Perhaps I should buy a house instead? I could get something decent for around $110k-$140k. That's 1,200-1,500 square foot, 3 beds &amp; 2 bathrooms usually. I could still have a roommate/my girlfriend pay me rent so I'm not eating the whole thing.

If I need to move after graduating, I could just make it a rent house.

I recently moved closer to campus paying for my first ever apartment while juggling full time schooling and a part time job(3 days a week)

For over the past year, I've been seriously struggling with finishing my assignment on time and producing quality work because of a few things- suffering from major depressive episodes, anxiety(recently medicated/diagnosed), having to commute 1.5 hours to class every day prior to moving, financial issues, and a major shot to the self esteem because I haven't been proud of any of my work. I almost took a medical leave last year because I was falling behind so much, and I was also threatened with academic probation from the school.

This year, I lessened my course load a bit and it's helped, and living closer has also helped, but I'm still falling behind. I recently had to quit my previous job unexpectedly because it was one of the major factors cutting into my assignment, I had to commute 40 minutes to get there and they weren't great about working around my school schedule so I didn't even have a day just to dedicate to homework. On top of that I'd be exhausted from standing for 8 hours. This was a bad move on my part, but I was positive that i'd be able to find something much closer in a short period of time. I was able to find another job within a week, but I had to get background checks/drug tests, and it took a couple weeks for everything to come back so with bills coming in I depleted all of my funds. Currently my bank account sits -$300+ and I've just been feeding my paychecks to my balance with no way to pay for food or gas. 

which puts me in my next issue- I have to have a major assignment printed and put together by tomorrow morning and I've been just waiting for my new credit card to come in the mail so I can pay for it somehow but it has yet to come in. (It's been about a week- I had to get a new card because it got compromised) So here I am, last minute, freaking out because Its the night before and I have nothing printed. For me to print everything would be about $20 roughly and I can't even afford that. I'd ask for help but if my family sent me the money it would just get eaten by my gaping bank account balance. 

I've already confided in this professor a couple weeks ago about the issues I've been having but I was certain by now I would've had everything figured out. I should've emailed her earlier this week but I was positive I'd have money by now. I've been behind on this assignment pretty much from the beginning and I feel really bad because I don't want it to seem like I'm purposefully putting off the assignment. I'm having a pretty bad panic attack thinking about having to do a presentation tomorrow and literally not having anything to show for the second time on the same assignment. 

I want to email her tonight even though she most likely won't see it before class tomorrow- what should I say?

603,katparry,1508795503,/r/college/comments/78b680/existential_crisis_in_progress_messy/,"Hello /r/college, I've been a lurker on here for quite some time. I'm about to dump a lot of stuff on you:


&amp;nbsp;

Background:

&amp;nbsp;

Longer story shorter, I'm 28 and in CC. I worked for 10 wonderful years in project management at a Fortune 50 company (making very good money with no degree), and was doing very well in my beloved career, but alas my husband got a job in D.C. and thus we moved. Instead of going back into the workforce I decided it was time to get my degree, something that I've wanted since I was young. Its something that I personally want to do to prove to myself that I can do because I tried to go to college once before and it was a massive failure (tl;dr really chaotic homelife, poor af, and stress made it really hard. Also I was not ready) so I went into the workforce instead. I was encouraged by a professor (that I took philosophy classes from while I was working full time) to continue to pursue academia... and he was right...I love school, I love learning, I'm a sponge, and I'm doing super well here. I'm very happy in school, and I dont ultimately regret my decision, but i is at the same time ruining my life because of the lack of ""knowns"".

&amp;nbsp;

Issue 1: Picking a Major

&amp;nbsp;

I can't seem to pick a major between Anthropology, Sociology, and .....Photography (photojournalism to be precise). In regards am not looking to get a ""job"" out of my degree because I am purely going to school to learn. I am a firm believer that the process of getting the liberal arts degree has great value, not to mention I have learned more in the three semesters of CC than I did during all of my other school years combined. I can only imagine what its going to be like to get deep into a major program and learn more.

&amp;nbsp;

I love photography because it takes me to new places and I'm good at it. It gives me satisfaction (when I like my own work), and It challenges me to always change my perspective. I love cultural anthropology because I love learning about a culture, food, the rituals, relationships, the politics, language. I love traveling and getting people's stories on their lives, their families, and so I usually pair my photography with a photo essay when I go. This is something that I've been doing since I was very little.  I love sociology because it involves systems and theory, which is where my mind loves to play. I also love philosophy and political science for the same reasons. It is a pure joy for my mind when I'm in these classes, I feel like I'm lifted out a deep dark hole of my depression and awestruck by the amazingness (or awfulness) of the human race whenever I get back from a good lecture. 

&amp;nbsp;

The issue I'm having is how do you discern between ""beloved hobby/subject"" and buckle down to ""undergrad major"". 

&amp;nbsp;


Issue 2: Picking a Transfer Institution

&amp;nbsp;

Its transfer season, so all of this seems to be weighing so heavily on my mind. I'll have three semesters under my belt, and four by the time I get into whatever institution I do get in to. My issue is that I have family members that are telling me that I shouldn't go to universities like Georgetown or GWU if I get in because its going to cost a lot of money...I'm really pining to go to those schools because of the curriculum and the teachers. I've been to the campus, Ive sat in on the classes. They are amazing schools. The family members I'm staying with think that me going to school without the solid idea of ""getting a job"" out of it is inconceivable. These are people who went straight from HS to Ivy League schools and had the money to pay for it. They had ideas that they wanted to be lawyers and teachers and whatnot since they were young, an apparently no one in this group has ever struggled with the ultimate life question ""what should I do with my time"". For the first time in my life I'm regretting being unconventional. I feel like a newborn baby deer learning to walk. Going to work after highschool was easy. I tried to avoid all this by giving up college, and this time I want to see it through.

&amp;nbsp;


So its getting to me. I feel strongly that it shoudln't matter that I don't *know* what I want to do on the job front because I'm going to get a job after. I'm highly employable. What the job is, where it is, I do not know, but I already feel that my time in college is opening me up to so many more possibilities. Values are very important to me, and the job that I have later after school will absolutely reflect my values and leverage the skillsets that I have built from my previous employment. I would not give a moment of my precious life-time to something that doesn't matter to me. I'm not worried about the future job prospects, I know I'm going to make it work.... but I am worried about the debt that school is going to pile on top of me. And if I'm going to be in debt, I want to make sure that I got a damn good education. So if I can ditch these feelings, and try and grow a thicker skin to shield myself from family members, I feel like I can largely ignore #2 and just worry about picking a major and picking how much debt I want. 

&amp;nbsp;


I currently have a 4.0 GPA and in a greek thing that opens up opportunities for me....also another honors program at my school that is AMAZING. (I've learned so much from honors classes!)  I've been getting good scholarships based on my merit at CC already, so I'm hoping that I would continue to get scholarships at whatever institution I get to attend. But I won't know what these financial aid packages look like until I get them. So I'll just have to wait for that. 

&amp;nbsp;


Conclusion: 
So I guess I'm just half-venting, half-asking if I'm nuts. Should I just bail on school and go back into the workforce, the thing that I'm good at? Am I ruining my life? What should I pick as a major? Does it really even matter for undergrad? Is it so bad that I just want to go to school to get a well-rounded liberal arts education? Should I just ignore these people or does my idealism need to be crushed with an iron fist?

I completely failed the first test like this is straight up guessing scores (below a 40), my advisors said I wouldn't get on academic probation even if I got a 0.0 in the class. But it's an added stress that I'm basically taking a class I know I'm going to fail and I know won't really matter. Im probably not the first or last person to be in this situation so I'm sure someone can guide me through this or help me feel better. I can't afford the 2,000 dollars. I can't but I want to. There's nothing I can do to pay it off. I fucking wish I could just drop the class, every fiber in my being wants to. But I know I just can't afford that (no loans, it won't just ""role over"" so I can pay it off later. Pay it all off at once or get kicked out of the university. I called my dad and he can't afford it either)


2,000 dollars is A LOT, compared to my classes being free but that 0.0 stays on my transcript forever (even when the grade is replaced) and that will fuck me up 100x more than any amount of money. So I either intentionally fail that class while doing good in others and owe 0 dollars. Or I drop the class, pay for it, and be stress free a little more because I won't feel that overwhelming guilt of ""I'm taking this class just so I can fucking fail it"" I just don't know how I'm going to pay for it.

I have encountered a few issues while searching for schools, they are as follows:

* Must be 100% online, (I can't afford to move out of state, and although **Ringling College of Art and Design** is minutes away from me, all their classes are on campus and about 8 hours long EACH! I struggle with the 1.5 hour classes at my community college, due to some physical limitations)

* Needs to be affordable. Ringling for example is 40k a year, and there's no way I would ever be able to afford going there regardless. **Savannah college of Art and Design** has an amazing eLearning program, but again it's around 30k a year :(

* Found some promising online schools, **Full Sail University** and the likes, but it seems that everyone recommends NOT going there because you won't get a job. Ugh.


There are a few schools which I feel like would be the best choice, but I don't know enough about them and if they are worth it. Can anyone give me advice on:

* **West Texas A&amp;M University** (Only has B.F.A in computer design, but it's like 7k a year! OMG!!!)
* **New England Institute of Technology** (has game program, but I can't find price, or if it's online)
* **Oregon State University** (has no game design, but B.S in Computer science, and IS online but no price)

Any other ideas? I'm really at a loss here. I don't want to waste several years getting a degree that won't help me get a job, but at the same time I can't afford to move out of state or pay 40k a year :(

609,biteszadusto9,1506302074,/r/college/comments/72992t/transferring_in_the_fall_after_freshman_year_im/,"I feel like I have made a terrible mistake in picking this college, I only went because it was cheap, and couldn't afford to go to UIUC, which was my best safety school. My tuition would have been free this semester, if not for the freshman living on campus rule. The school I am attending is very small, with only a few thousand people, and there's not a lot of activities or stuff to do on campus. Despite this, it couldn't be that bad, could it?


 Believe me, I tried to keep a positive atittude and was really excited about starting college and trying to make friends. However, I have autism, and it's a crucial part of my identity and my lifestyle, so I got in contract with my school's disability office to talk about accomadations for this school year. Big mistake. They argued with me about living off campus or having a single room, and told me the school needs money, so freshman have to live on campus. I have a math learning disability as well, and am in the process of more comprehensive testing to really ""prove it"" , but it was established that I really struggle in the subject. The only accomadation I got was more test time, and so far, I haven't even gotten that in my class. I was told that my school loves diversity, but it seems like they view me and my disorder as a hassle more than anything. 



I also had to fight them for a parking pass to go to my doctor's appointments, and they're making me park in a lot 2 miles off campus because I can't park where the upperclassman are, which is bullshit and has made me late so many times, because I can't scheduele my doctors appointments at an earlier/later time. I refuse to miss class. So far I've gotten multiple parking tickets, most of them for not knowing where to park because I was never told where the lot was and its not on the map, and they told me it was my fault. I've been told to just deal with living in the dorms  by everyone with the exception of the school doctor and councelor, who have put me on anxiety medication and are making me go to therapy every week to try and cope with being here. I tried living in my dorm and couldn't handle it cause of people and noise, so they switched my room to a suite that I share with other people, who completely ignore me and make me feel even more unwelcome there. I just quit staying in my dorm and am staying off campus in the place I share with my friend for free, in exchange for driving her to the bus so we can go to class.


Also, since I had to pay for a meal plan, I eat in the cafeteria most of the time and I saw someone who had no meals left, and swiped my card for them. The lunch lady at the register pulled me aside and told me I was never to do that again, or they would confiscate my card. I nearly cried. This school makes me incredibly nervous and rigid, and I haven't made any friends here at all. All of the clubs I would be interested in meet late at night, like video game and anime clubs, so I never have the energy to go. I've tried to form a club for autistic people but can't get it approved, and have tried everyday to sit in the disability center in the library to meet more people I can relate to, but with no luck. I'm trying sports, but I'm very uncooridinated and bad at talking, so I tend to ramble or make comments every two seconds, and I don't fit it at all on my incredibly small, tight knit club team. I don't fit in at this school in general either. Most of the campus is vegan and I get lectured my strangers about how eating meat is animal abuse. Like really, what the fuck? People write things like ""Violence is the answer. Violence is a necessity"" all over the sidewalks and that is allowed and often encouraged. One girl was pitching a fit on the bus about misgendering animals and how that's important, and as a trans person, I wanted to deck her for saying something like that. But no one at my school is interested in anything but politics, that's all most of the clubs or events are about, and a lot of the dicussions in my classes are about political stuff 90% of the time. You have to adapt the exact views of everyone else or you will not be accepted, or get bad grades for it. (Multiple people have told me this)


I am almost failing my Calculus class, failing both the first quiz and test. I've been going to tutoring at school and I'm going to get help outside of school, studying constantly, and meeting with my professor, but because my algebra skills are so poor, I can barely catch up. Yet, my professor thinks I shouldn't go back to precalc because I took it last year. I've been in tears so many times because I feel like a failure, and despite making As in my other classes, I can't have that low grade affecting my GPA. I need to get out of here. My family and partner are telling me to just be strong and get through it, that I'm acting like a child and will adjust if I force myself to, but I've tried, and I can't stand it here. I want to transfer to clemson, a school closer to home, where I can live off campus and make more connections. (I know people in the area and have support, whereas I only have one person at my current school) I'm working on the application, but I really don't know about the process besides that, and who i need to contact to send paperwork and transcripts over. Can someone who has transferred before offer advice in this trying time?

Starting September of that year I began attending a community college because my grades in high school were terrible as I never tried and had no aspirations at the time or any idea of what I wanted to truly do. I chose some bullshit major and for my first semester at the college &amp; I only took about 3 classes. I then was taking about 4 classes the next semster which began in January 2016. This was when I first changed my major and thus since I was performing bad in the classes that I chose to major in I knew I wouldn't get through it and decided to stop those classes and thus only finished with 2.

I then took a long time that summer of 2016 deciding what the hell I wanted to do and what my interests were so I chose Business Administration with the hopes of transferring to a real university and hoping to major and attain a Bachelor's degree in Marketing. It's what I truly want to do and am aspiring to get. Fast forward a year later and it's September 2016 and I have my business classes picked and do well in pretty much all of them. university. January 2017 rolls up which means new semester and I can't take the rest of my business classes because I have to complete the rest of my remedial math classes so I could only take 4 classes that semester.

Now is September 2017 and the new semester started. Im taking my last remedial math class, my GPA is a 3.16 and I am taking 17 credits (5 classes). I feel miserable and fed up with this shit. The remedial classes have held me back and so has me changing my major. I have 36 credits completed out of the 60 I need. Since im taking 17 credits now I'll have only 7 left if all goes well and I complete this semester. That means I'll only have 1 semester left.

Currently I am a first semester freshman at a Penn State branch campus studying IST (Information Science and Technology). Originally, I was planning on staying here all 4 years but after being here for a few weeks I'm not so certain. It's really hard to make friends here as it's a commuter school, and the IST major isn't exactly what I want. IST is the only major at this campus I'm at all interested in, but I'm more into more in depth stuff (computer science) but I couldn't place high enough in math for that. 

I recently found out that my school has a BS of Computational Data Science which sounds right up my alley and the entrance to major requirements are attainable, unlike pure CS. The problem here is cost. The major is only offered at the main campus, which would be quite a bit more expensive. Tuition here is around 13k for lower level classes, and 15k for upper level (my family and I are already struggling to pay even this, fucking religious private school tuition. Maxed out federal loans aren't enough). Main campus on the other hand, is around 20k, and that's not including room and other fees. Only way I'd be able to afford main campus would be lots of private loans, as my parents are refusing to take out parent loans and they really can't help at all with payment, due to the aforementioned private schools. I'm not going to hedge my bets on scholarships as they are a crapshoot but I'll sure as hell apply. 

TLDR: Do I stay at my current branch campus and do a major I'm not completely interested in, or do I swap majors to Data Science and go to main campus but have to take out substantial private loans for increased tuition and board?

While I've gotten some financial aid, I have had to take out a few loans that I've been paying off steadily. Recently my grandmother decided to assign the 529 plan that was originally intended for my brother to me, as he would not be attending college. Because the loans have already been dispersed, I was told that I could not reject them or use my 529 plan to pay them off; however, I think I found a loophole.

I realized that when there is an excess in the amount of aid or payment provided to the school, they will refund it to my personal checking account. In the past this has occurred when my financial aid was about $100 or so over the cost of attendance, so I used the extra money to pay for books. If I were to make a payment using the 529 plan, though, the amount of money would be refunded to my checking account. In turn, I could use this money from my personal account to pay off some of my loans. 

Before I do this, however, I do need to know if this is legal. I don't want to break any laws or rules that could prevent me from getting aid in the future. Is this a legitimate loophole I can use or could it get me in trouble? Does the transferring of money from the school bursar to my account change its status from 529 funds to personal funds? I'd appreciate any advice on this subject.

Tl;dr: I can't use my 529 plan to pay off loans, but if I submit it to the bursar it will be refused to my personal account.

And I know the ""smart"" thing would be to just let them do it and not worry about student loans, but I can't do this anymore. And I'd really rather not drop out and work full-time right now because I have a really good job at school, plus I just really enjoy being at school. 

So, if anyone has any advice, I am all ears, because I'm going into this blind. I don't have a ton of money saved up, but I am a resident of the state my school is in (UCSC), and I'm hoping that I can get some aid as an independent. Would it be too late, though? Would I have to refile a FAFSA? Again, any advice is awesome, because I am lost as hell haha.

My friend and I have roomed together before and have had no issues, and our third roommate is totally cool with stopping her smoking if it bothers us, but the fourth roommate is big into pot.

Now, even though this is against the lease policy as it's a school-affiliated apartment, we have no problem with her smoking it in general. The issue is that despite her doing it in her room, closing the door, and opening the window, it manages to waft out into the entire apartment. My roommate with severe asthma was gone this past weekend so she hasn't been around it yet, but I have and I'M coughing and having chest pain, so I KNOW my asthmatic roommate is going to have big health issues with it.

I brought it up to the pot roommate tonight, but I'm not sure if she's going to be willing to stop. I'm planning on bringing it up again tomorrow to get a 100% certain answer, but if worst comes to worst (and she DOESN'T stop in the coming week) I guess we'll just have to threaten to tell our RA??? She could very easily get kicked out if this were the case, but we don't wanna do that to her. We aren't normally snitches or anything, but it's making me feel crappy and for my asthmatic roommate it'll be WAY worse.

Has anyone else had a similar situation? What would you do? I'd like to stay on good terms with this girl, but I'll flush that potential friendship down the toilet if that's what it takes to get her to stop.

And before anyone asks: it's illegal to smoke pot in our housing area, we could get in trouble if authority finds out. All four of us moved in at the same time and pay equal ""rent"", so no one ""got here first"". And lastly, we were assigned roommates randomly, so there was no contacting beforehand to check the asthmatic/weed-smoker statuses. Any opinions or advice would be appreciated.

TLDR: How to confront a pot-smoking roommate when my other (severely asthmatic) roommate and I are both irritated by the smoke?

UPDATE: I talked to my roommate and told her we can't have pot-smoking in the apartment, and she seemed disappointed but somewhat agreeable. She said that she won't smoke in the apartment anymore, so now I guess we just have to wait and see if she sticks to her word.

618,queen_quills,1503126554,/r/college/comments/6unpun/lost_my_fullride_considering_taking_a_gap_year_as/,"Hello redditors, let me just start by saying that these last few months have been super stressful for me. In June I got an email from out of the blue that basically said, ""SURPRISE, you're no longer eligible for the four years of full tuition we promised you!1!!!1!1!"".  Because of my good grades in high school, I was offered a full-ride tuition scholarship at my college. Of course I said yes, and so I went through my freshman year with only one loan taken out, which was for my housing. 

I've been trying since June to figure out why my scholarship was taken away, and I only just now got the answer after months of my school's financial aid office jerking me around. The school says that my parents make too much money to receive financial aid. In order for me to receive my scholarship, there is a stipulation that says I must also receive the federal Pell grant, which I do not qualify for. They said that I shouldn't have qualified for it at all last year as well, and it was a ""fluke"" that I did. 

I worked hard all of last year to ensure that I could continue my education as smoothly as possible in the fall term of 2017. I got an apartment set up all the way back in November that I am set to move into in September. I already have two job interviews in place on-campus. My classes are all picked out and I've been set to start this fall term since the last term ended. HOWEVER, the only option I have right now is to take out a 25k+ loan to pay for both my tuition and housing. I'm not sure what I should do. The 25k loan will pay for everything, but money will be very tight and I might not have enough for food/electric bill/and the new laptop I desperately need. The first month's rent is due on September 1st, and I have the money for it, but if I decide not to go to school I won't move to my apartment and I honestly don't think they would give me that money back. So I have to make this decision by September 1st at the latest. 

The other option I have is to completely withdraw from school for a year or two, stay at my summer job and finally buy myself a car, and slowly pay off the loan I have. I plan to be a doctor, and I know school will always be there, and being a young doctor is more of a curse than a blessing really, so I guess I could live with taking a year or two off. I just feel terrible because my roommate is my best friend and I was SO excited to get my first apartment with her. I have no idea what to do. My parents say they will try to see if they can get approved for the 25k loan, but I feel guilty for having them do that. 

Should I take a gap year? Emotionally, it will hurt, A LOT, but financially speaking, it's the smarter thing to do, I believe. Going back to school and living in my first apartment that I've been planning for months to live in with my friend is what I truly want to do, but that loan amount scares the shit out of me. I know that being a doctor means that I will have +100k in student loan debt by the time I'm done, but I don't know... I would feel bad asking my parents to co-sign on a loan that much. Do you guys have any advice? I feel so lost and I feel like my life has completely slipped out of control. Bailing on my best friend right before we are supposed to move in together feels awful too. 

Note: I know community college is always an option, but the one where I live is TINY and does not offer the classes that I need to satisfy my pre-reqs, (i.e. labs and other pre-med classes).

TL:DR: I lost my full-ride and I know for a fact that I will not be getting it back for at least the next two years, if at all. I can't decide between taking out loans or staying with my parents for another year or two and earning money at my current job. Have to decide this all by September 1st.

I have a few national Math, English and other extracurricular activities also. I was the leader of my school guitar club and participate in many events as their technician.

My family can pay around 15000 - 20000 a year for my education and I don't mind working hard myself.

So I really want to study Computer Science, it's been my passion since I was a kid and is still my passion today. So here are some of my questions that I hope you guys can help me with since even after a few months of research I still can't quite make up my mind.

1. Which would be a good school for me based on my ? ( I'm eyeing MIT at my dream school as most of you have already guesses but around 5 more school should be nice to include in the list )

2. Which state would be suitable for my financial situation ?

3. I've already got my recommendation letters from my teachers, do I need one more from someone else ? I keep hearing different opinions on this.

4. What else should I do to make my application looks better ? Extracurricular activities ? Grades or any other tests I should take ?

5. Can anyone share some experience studying CE in the US with me ?

My first few years of college left me with nothing more than tens (and tens) of thousands of dollars in debt. My parents don't have the ability to contribute much at all, and gone are the days of taking out loans to pay for my apartment. I'm transferring schools and living back at home with my parents while I finish school over the next 3 to 4 years. The nearest good school, the one I am transferring to, is roughly an hour commute each way. On top of this, I will be working roughly 20 hours a week to help offset some of the costs. Going into additional debt is going to happen, I just want to lessen that as much as possible. I do have a lot of credits coming in, so my average semester shouldn't be anymore than 12 hours. Still, even now, I'm getting a bit overwhelmed at spending 2 hours a day in a car and 4 to 5 hours at work with a (mostly) full time load. I'd love to find an apartment in the city closer to school, but that would require a significant increase in pay so that I could afford it completely on part-time hours.

Good news: said job, if I can continue to keep it the next several years, will reimburse up to $5,250 a year in tuition. I really don't want to give this up. The only scenarios in which I would are if I truly can't handle the load, or if I find part time work related to the field I'm going to school for (software development).

 In high school, I was pretty good at everything, at Foreign Languages, Literature, Mathematics and Physics. I worked harder for the last two, so I'm going to study Electrical Engineering (a little bit different from the American one, here it's only about electrical systems and power), but that's where my problem begin.

 How do I know if I will like it? I mean, how does anyone who didn't go to college yet know for sure if they like the major they picked? What if I fail all my classes? And if I don't like it, what am I going to do? I don't like anything like it's the passion of my life, but I can get pretty good at anything I work on. I'm really, really scared, I can't even read anything, including texts from my friends without freaking out. And I know they worry about their majors just like me, but I can't help it. My heart beats so fast all time and I can't even breathe normally sometimes. I'm in an awful shape and I'm scared that won't go away. 

 And I can't stay a year at home. I live in a rural area in Eastern Europe. After a year of staying here, I will be as clueless and anxious as I am now, because there is no one I can talk to. People from here didn't go to college. So that's not an option. 

 Also, debt isn't a problem. College is free here; I think I would go plain crazy if it wasn't. But moving in the biggest town in my country after living peacefully in a village scares the hell out of me. And switching majors isn’t that easy, because then you have to pay for your new major. 

 What can I do to easy at least a little bit my soul? I can't do this anymore; it just eats out my life day by day.

My parents and I pay for my tuition. We've never paid for it on time and have sometimes had to take out loans to pay for it. In the fall/winter 2016/2017 we experienced a major setback, so much so that mom put her studies on hold. I had to take out a loan to pay for the majority of my own tuition. 


Family and I decided that I was going to transfer to the local university which has my program and would be a fine fit. Then proceeded to change our minds when I became more involved with my school by going Greek (Family and I made the decision to transfer literally the day after I invested non-refundable money to join, so at that point, I had to follow through). Just one issue: I decided to not apply when I was on-campus (which is given priority) so now I will have to apply through general housing. This is a huge gamble where housing is not guaranteed. Housing is the biggest portion of my tuition (over half) and the hardest to pay off. I don't want to continue having financial issues. 


Which is why, regardless of whether I get a space before the year starts, I'm considering staying home and commuting round trip (2-3 hours one way) twice a week.


**Pros:**

*Can work in my hometown, so I can make more money

*Would have my own space, instead of maybe (not likely) getting a single on campus or a double with a complete stranger

*Everything would be more accessible to me because I'd have a car at home

*Saving money ($4-6k)

*Would use study spaces of local and community colleges

*Mom could finish her degree because of the saved money


**Cons:** 

*Farther from my greek org which will definitely need me (only 2 other people) 

*Would most likely be tired from the commute

*Social life would indeed tank

*Losing independence by living with my family


You can definitely see that I'm pro-staying home. Please let me know what you think! Especially if you have cons I didn't list here.


TL;DR: Room &amp; Board is like $6k a semester. I'm cheap. I can't see that being worthwhile at all knowing that we would definitely be struggling financially with it. I had a issue with signing up for priority housing so now it's a gamble that I would even get a space on campus at this point. Am considering taking the train which is 2-3 hrs one way twice a week for school at least for the fall to save some money. I know I'll miss out socially but I'm a senior so that's not a huge issue anymore. I'd be saving $4k a semester. Refer to above pros and cons. Are there huge issues I'm overlooking? Help?!

I am a 17 year old girl who's current plan is to go to college out of state. I am moving to the state where my college is and living with my mother who is already there (however I will not be receiving in state tuition, that's besides the point). The price is hefty (39,000 a year for tuition + room and board + personal expenses) and my both of my parents don't qualify for a Parent Plus Loan. The most money my family will get to pay for college is $5000. I've applied for scholarships and despite being a minority women going into the STEM field and being a first generation college student I did not win any of the scholarships I applied to lol. Anyways my point being is that paying for college is a problem for my family that we don't have a solution for.

I've already talked to my family about potentially not going to college this fall. It's not for sure since we're still looking at options as to how we're going to pay and potentially getting another family member to cosign the loan. Anyways I'm really considering taking a gap year and just working and volunteering. I would also like to do some tutoring too.

I want to make myself more productive and get more experiences. Also I'm young, very young for a graduating senior and freshmen in college. I'm not even an adult yet (and I won't be until this September) and I'm not sure I'm ready for the commitment of college. I've been struggling with depression and mostly very severe anxiety this past year also and I really want to do something with my life that will make me happy now that I'm done with high school and I have the freedom to do so.

However the cons of a gap year are what's preventing me from going through with this. While my plan is to work, volunteer, and be productive I know myself, and I know that I am lazy person. I can see myself falling behind and not keeping up with my own education. I am afraid that I will miss out on an education and this gap year will turn into 2 years and I just won't end up going to school. I was also thinking about taking a semester off or so after my first two years of college, which I read was beneficial to some. I really do not want to go to a CC because I really want the freshmen experience at a college and I don't want to transfer in as a junior anywhere. I feel like if I took a gap year it'd be alright because I would be the age of most of the kids coming in.

Anyways thanks for reading that and as you can see I'm really conflicted. This has been a subject of stress but I know things are going to work out for me. I would just like other opinions.

Most engineering pathways pay really well (90k-130k a year) but can't really decide what exact major I should decide on. Due to my excellent performance in science and average skills in math, I ideally wanted to work in a mostly science dedicated field. Chemical engineering was a major I would really like to do but the fact that it has a high percentage of people who move away from this major (most likely due to intense workload) has kinda scared me away from this major. Petroleum engineering has also caught my interest due to a very high salary but new innovations moving away from petroleum could mean it would be a declining field.

I do get some financial aid, however it only supports 1/3 of my full college tuition, not counting books and supplies. I currently commute to school because I simply cannot afford to live on campus. I had originally saved up $10k from my menial part-time minimum wage jobs over the last three years of my high school (from sophomore+).

I set aside this money specifically for college because my parents are in financial debt themselves. They're irresponsible with money, so I knew they wouldn't be able to help me pay down the tuition (even though they make a lot of money together which disqualifies me for financial aid).

As of this next financial aid year, as frustrating as it is, I have lost my all financial aid that I was originally receiving. Thus, I'm going to have to pay $1,500 more dollars on average per semester than I already have been.

My ending goal is to come out with no debt. So, I'm curious, does anyone have a similar situation to me? And, if so, how do you handle it?

My parents don't make jack squat in money (aka below poverty line) and I don't make very much either (also below poverty line) so why the hell do they think my parents are able to contribute anything towards my education?  
  
Okay time to be rational. So if I can't get a ton of aid then I have to take out loans. Okay did that for the first 3 years of CC while working towards a two year degree and going to school only part time and work full time so I can financially support myself the whole time and pay for my own rent, groceries, blah blah blah. Well year four arrives and I'm on track to graduate but I'm told that I'm no longer eligible to take out any loans because I've been working on the same degree for too long. Crap okay time to pay out of pocket this year. Fine.   
  
Now that degree is done but I'm transferring to university for my four year degree but if it takes me four additional years I will run out of loans again and I cannot pay out of pocket for university tuition, it just isn't a reality.   
  
So now what? Drop out until I'm 25? Get pregnant? Get married? The whole thing makes zero freaking sense. I hate it and  overly emotional rn and ughhhh. Just needed to vent I guess.

My whole life I have dreamed of working in film. It is one of the few dreams that has been consistent throughout the years, and I can confidently say that I am unable to see myself thriving academically and enjoying any other major. I have my heart set on film and there is nothing else I want to pursue. My senior year of high school, I opted to commit to a liberal arts school that did not offer my major, in order to save money and later transfer to my dream school. I was thrilled to be accepted into Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California for fall of 2016. It has everything that I looked for in a college:
-Thriving film school, with an abundance of opportunities due to their 
 connections
-Prime film student location (LA)
-Large university
-Ethically diverse (I'm half Asian so this was important to me)
-Thriving varsity sports teams
-a minor in dance
-a dance team/club that I could participate in
-study abroad in the majorly unoffered country I was looking for

After attending a small liberal arts school out in Pennsylvania, that did not offer any of these qualifications, I can say that I was quite miserable that year. Even though the school worked out financially (no loans, my parents could pay out of pocket for it), I can't see myself ever going back. In addition to not offering my major or minor, which would cause me to have to change my entire career path, I did not enjoy the small campus, small student body, lack of college sports and clubs, and pretty much everything else that a small school in the middle of nowhere offers. I'm looking for the stereotypical college experience (large campus, loads of people of all ages, sports, loads of clubs, etc). The professors I encountered were great at my previous institution, but I can't see myself getting good opportunity from a virtually unknown school that can't take me in the career path I am seeking.

Because of these reasons, being accepted into LMU, that offered everything I dreamed of, thrilled me. However, it was financially horrible. The financial aid they offered was so low, I would of had to take out private loans in addition to the loans offered, and if I was able to take out private loans (which I can't because my parents cannot cosign or take on any debt due to their financial situation), I would have graduated with a minimum debt of $50,000, and that would be if I was lucky. Since I could not afford it for fall of 2016, I willing took the year and worked. I reapplied for fall of 2017, was accepted, and now I have the exact same financial issue that made my parents say no the first time.

Since I am already a year behind, and really do not want to waste another year, my parents said they were willing to let me go to LMU, but due to the financial reasons I mentioned, they said that they cannot guarantee that I could finish my degree there. They are willing to let me go for my sophomore year, but when junior year comes around, they can't promise that they will have money left to afford it - which would also mean we are out of money for me to transfer to what would be my third college to get a degree.

I've been looking around at colleges that still accept applications at this time, and I found a few that I might be able to see myself being content at, even though they don't offer everything I looked for like LMU did.

Baylor University: Large university, thriving division 1 sports (esp football), lots of clubs, well known university, offers my major and minor, and has a dance team that I can perform and compete with. The only downside is that it is in the middle of nowhere in Texas, which I think might make me a bit depressed, and I also don't think it would provide the best connections for a film job since it's in Texas)

The New School: spectacular location for film students (New York City), has my major and minor, closer to home so travel is cheaper, but it lacks the sports scene, isn't a well known school, not a lot of clubs, doesn't really offer your typical college experience, and what really sucks for me is that they don't have any sort of dance team/club that I could participate in throughout my years, which I really want to do (esp competitively). However, they offer a jazz dance class as an extracurricular, and could potentially provide good opportunity to a film student so the location is prime. Also, I've done some modeling work, and unlike the other schools I'm mentioning, I could probably continue to do it at this school because its in NYC.

American University: decent location (Washington D.C), large university, thriving athletics, has my major and minor, but there is no dance team that I could participate in, which I'm really looking for, and I probably wouldn't get in if I applied.

I've considered also trying for Syracuse, but I'm still thinking about it. I should note that I have not applied to these 3 schools I just mentioned, I've been considering if I should spent the money to do so since I think I might have to say no to LMU, but I really don't know what to do and what path to take. Also, I don't even know if these school will financially work out for me if I was accepted (I assumed they be better than LMU since LMU is ranked as being one of the stingiest school with financial aid). I want with all my heart to go to LMU, but the finances are clearly not in my favor, and I do not want to take another year off and get even more behind in my career and studies.

I'm so lost, confused, and tired at this point. I'd appreciate any advice.

I just finished my sophomore year of college at my local university. All of my classes have gone to three different majors, none of which have been ""right"" for me. I never had the motivation to do well throughout my entire educational career before college, and I still have no motivation or direction.              
                
I started doing an art degree but quickly decided to switch because of the bad job market for that. Changed to CS but switched from that because, despite my love of computers, I really hated even the entry classes. I then made a rash and not well thought out decision to start Electrical Engineering, despite struggling very hard with math and science throughout high school. I thought I could just ""struggle"" through it with hard work and dedication replacing actual aptitude. Went pretty terribly. I literally can't force myself to pay attention/concentrate even when my future depends on it. I get so easily distracted by anything.                 
                
At this point I don't know what to do. I feel like I've squandered these two years of time and tuition. I'm looking at a couple options but these still might be terrible, but what else do I do?                 
              
- *English major*            
    I've always been skilled at writing/reading, english classes have been the only ones I've done well in through high school and college. I'd like to maybe get a job writing in some capacity, or even go on to grad school and become a professor/teacher. *However* almost everything I read online is about how English degrees are a terrible idea and that everyone should go STEM. What are your thoughts on this? What if I'm too dumb for STEM?              
                 
- *Programming associates degree at local CC*             
     I'm wary of doing this because I've never been skilled at picking up programming, despite my interest in it. This would purely be to at least have *some* sort of degree that I could get a job with, instead of nothing.          
                
             
Thanks for reading, I'd very much like to hear your advice on what I should do. I feel lost, I feel like a failure, and I'm very worried about my future especially because I should be two years from graduating, and at this point I'm still basically 4 years away.            
             
**Tl;dr:** Wasted two years in college on 3 different majors, failed at all of them. Lost, don't know what do to. English major is probably something I could actually be successful at, but might be a worthless degree? Another option would be a programming associates just to have the piece of paper, possibility of doing poorly in that too.

637,Devin2019,1496156928,/r/college/comments/6e7wo8/i_havent_been_doing_so_well_in_college_i_feel/,"Hello everyone,

I just need to vent my feelings. I just feel so hopeless. I would really appreciate it if you take the time to read this. I'm going into my third year of college, and so far I haven't been doing very well. I am majoring in Biology with intentions of becoming a Physician Assistant. I have been doing poorly in pretty much all my science classes. So far I have received two C's in my Biology courses, two C's in my math courses, and a D in General Chemistry. So far, I will definitely have to retake two of my sciences since they are the prerequisites for PA school, and most schools require that you have a B or higher in the prerequisite courses. I just don't how I'm going to make it to PA school or even get through it if I am having such a hard time in my undergraduate science courses. I feel like my biggest problems are procrastination and time management. For example, if I know that I have an exam coming up in the next two or three weeks I tell myself ""Oh I have enough time"". Then I wait until about five days before the exam to start studying. I cram so much of the material in such a short amount of time that I hardly remember everything, and then I end up not doing so well on the exam. Then I tell myself, ""Oh I'll do better on the next exam"". Then I end up doing the same thing I did for the last exam. I keep falling into this trap of procrastination and not using my time wisely. I know I should be studying for my classes or an exam for a few hours each day from day one instead of waiting until the last minute, but it's just hard for me to get the motivation to study. Another bad habit I do is, I'll tell myself ""Okay I need to start studying for my upcoming Biology exam"". I'll go on my laptop to start going through the power point slides my professor went through for the day and relistening to the lecture that the professor posts online. I'll do that for like 30 minutes then I decide to surf the net for hours on end. I know I shouldn't be doing this, but it's hard to break this habit.

I get so jealous when my fellow classmates or friends do well on an exam and I do poorly. I also get upset when I score below average on an exam. I get jealous because they are are getting the results that I want and are on a better path towards grad school. I also get upset because I know that I'm capable of doing better. My assigned lab partner and I for my Microbiology lab this past Fall 2016 semester decided to exchange numbers to help each other out with lab stuff. I kind of struggled in lab, but he helped me out so much and was very patient with me which I am very grateful for. Biology labs at my university are intertwined with lecture. A few days after our third lecture exam, my lab partner and I were working in a group with a few other students for an experiment and he asks, ""What did you guys think of the third exam?"" We were all talking about it, and then he brings up the second exam which many people thought was very hard and since the raw average was low, the professor had to give a huge curve for that exam. He said, ""Everyone thought the second exam was hard, but I didn't think it was that hard. And with the huge curve the professor gave I did phenomenal"". After he said that I was curious to know how he did on the first and third exam. He said he got a B- on the third and I believe he said he also got a B on the first exam. He didn't say what his score was on the second exam, but if he said he did phenomenal I'm guessing he probably got like a 97 or 98. I just got irritated because he scored well above average on the exam that many people thought was hard and did pretty solid on the other exams and I was doing poorly. He was also doing well in lab. After the final grades were posted for the class, he texted me to ask me how did I do in the class? I got a C+ but lied and told him I got a B because I was discouraged to tell him I got a C because I assumed he got a good grade in the class, which he did. He told me ""I actually did wind up getting an A. I studied 6-8 hours a day for a week for the final so I scored quite well."" I told him good job, but deep down inside I was frustrated because I wanted an A in the class. I know I shouldn't be jealous of how he did because he worked so hard and I didn't and he helped me out so much in lab and was a nice guy, and is a pre-med student so he has to get good grades, but I can't overcome my jealousy. He ended up making the Dean's list for the first time in Fall 2016 and once again this past Winter 2017.

So far my overall GPA is a 3.0. My science GPA is a 2.5. I already know I'm going to lose my scholarship again. I say again because it was pulled from me after my first year for not meeting the GPA requirement of 3.3 after only having a 3.0. I appealed it and luckily the Financial Aid Office gave it back to me to give me a second chance. They made it very clear in their email that this was a one-time exception. Once again I didn't make the GPA requirement and now my scholarship is going to be taken away for good which it should. They gave me a second chance to raise my GPA, and I still haven't done that. They're not going to give me any more chances because the scholarship could've been given to someone who was going to take it more seriously. And they're going to think I'm full of it because I stated in my appeal letter a plan to improve my grades, and they're going to think I haven't followed through with that plan. Now I have to solely rely on financial aid and student loans to pay for my tuition. It's discouraging because I did so well in high school. I maintained a 3.9 GPA in high school and was number seven in my class of 120 students. Once I got to college, everything went downhill. College is definitely harder than high school. Especially being a science major. I asked myself ""Is the medical field the path I really want to go towards?"". I can't see myself doing anything else, I would love to save people's lives and help those in need. I know I shouldn't be jealous of anyone doing well in college because the only person I can blame is myself. It's not their fault that I'm doing poorly it's my fault. They're obviously putting in the effort and trying their hardest and I'm not. And I know I shouldn't compare myself to other people, but it's hard not to because they're doing things I want. I just feel so discouraged and am developing low self-confidence. I feel like I'm wasting time, money, and my life by not doing well in college. Sorry I made you read all this, but I just needed to pour my feelings out. This is how I feel and this is what I went through. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Basically, I'm returning to school in the Fall of 2017 and during the FALL ONLY, I plan on working full time (35-40 hours a week) to help pay for school. My schedule at work is complicated, but I'll explain it the best I can.

I work 5 p.m. - 3:30 a.m

(Week 1) Work Tu-W-Th-F, Saturday off

(Week 2) Work Su-M, Tu-W off, Work Th-F, Saturday off

(Week 3) Work S-M-Tu-W, Then I'm off 5 day in a row and go back to week one, thereby starting the cycle over again. 

Work is approximately 1 hour from school and I plan on taking only 12 credits during my fall semester. This will allow me to save up more than enough money to paid for my first year expenses not covered by my rather disappointing financial aid package. Also, I plan on taking classes on either MWF or TTh giving me ""free days"" to sleep and do homework in addition to having every Saturday off as well. 

I know this may seem like a lot, but at this point I have no other option really. My parents can give me money for renting textbooks, but they have bills of their own and I can't and won't give them the burden of supporting me more than that. They've done enough for me. 

This plan is only for one semester. I know by doing this I can reap the benefits in the spring by being able to live off my savings.

I was always undecisive as a kid and still am, and I always go through different phases of liking things, so I never really knew what to study in college. I also didn't know much about college (being the first child of immigrants), so I wasn't mentally prepared when I decided to go to community college right after high school, because back then it just felt like the right thing to do. 

I studied IT for a year and changed my major to English because I was always praised by my English teachers and professors and was decent at writing, and graduated with an associate's. When the time came to transfer, I decided to switch back to studying IT in a University because I wanted to make money. After about 3 years of IT, I couldn't pass this one mandatory Java class that everyone seemed to fail at least once, and I took it 3 times. They changed how it worked every semester and the way it was taught was ridiculous, but that's another story. 

I was forced to change my major, so last year, out of nowhere, I switched to Film and Media studies because I've always wanted to be a filmmaker but wanted to do it alongside getting a good degree, but I was desperate at this point, so I went along with it. I'm about halfway done with it now, but I have no motivation to keep going with it. 

I've gone through three part-time jobs that I've hated alongside going to school, have to drive 40 mins to campus everyday, all the students look 10 years younger than me now, and my loan debt is rising every day (I don't get much financial aid because my parents make a decent amount but have tons of bills). Then there's the stress of everyone in my family and my friends always asking me when I'm graduating and all that. Honestly, I'm just tired of school -exams, studying, lectures, and all that. Especially when it comes to film; I feel like I'm wasting my time on most days -which is really the point of my post: I feel like I'm wasting my life. I feel like I could be spending that time doing something else like making music at home (another hobby of mine) or working on writing a script. 

I really don't know what to do. Time seems to be flying by real fast and I can't believe I've been in college for more than 6 years. I wanna get started on life and hate being stuck with my parents. I don't know what I'm gonna do with my B.A. in Film, and I need something good to pay off all my loans.

I'm finally starting to feel that pressure of having to decide essentially the rest of my life right now. I'll be 18 in a few months and will have 46 credits by then, and I should be graduating from community college with my 2-year in December. This is when I need to actually figure out what I'm doing, where I'm going, how everything is going to work, and I am absolutely losing my mind.

I think I want to be an actuary, but I'm not entirely sure. It sounds like something that would suit me but I got the idea from a reddit post so who knows. If I don't put a name on something I would want to be I feel completely directionless and purposeless and pointless.

I can't decide if I should transfer to USF or UCF, and that decision needs to be made soon if I intend to transfer in Spring 2018. USF is closer to home, and I've been there before for various events. UCF has a program for me to minor into Actuarial Science, but it's farther from home (but closer to my boyfriends school.) I can always do what he does and come home on the weekends, but that's a super long drive.

I also have zero idea on how my Florida prepaid works. My great grandfather bought it lump sum in 2001, so it's not even my money I'm wasting if I mess up my life path entirely. Due to dual enrollment and having to pay out of pocket this summer, I should be getting back 49 credits worth of tuition and fees. I'm pretty sure I'm going to be getting back the 2001 equivalent, though, not the 2017 equivalent. I honestly have no idea - the website is less than helpful because I'm not 18 yet, so it's not in my name technically. 

Additionally, the plan only includes 4 semesters of dorm, so I'd either have to pay out of pocket for summer or just not go to school, which is the part that worries me. I could in theory use one semester for a summer semester, but I'm not confident taking 15 credit hours in a summer semester is a good idea. 

Not to mention that I would have to take 15 hours a semester to not have to pay out of pocket. With my mental state being how it is, I wouldn't be able to work and go to school at that many hours, but I'd have to pay for books somehow. If the money I get back from above is 2017 money, I should be ok, but if it's 2001 money, I'm not going to have enough for the whole 2.5 years worth of school left. 

I guess the point of all this is that I should have my shit together but I don't and I don't know how to get there. 

I have worries about the dorm as well. I'll be transferring in in the Spring rather than Fall, and I'll be coming in as a junior I guess. I don't feel like I'm going to make friends easily, and I don't even know what kind of dorm my plan covers. I've seen the inside of my boyfriends dorm (where he shares his sleeping room with another person) and I don't think I'll be able to do that. I could share a flat with someone, yes, but not a bedroom. At least his roommate is a longtime friend of his (and mine) so it's not like he's sharing with a stranger.

I guess I just need some reassurance type thing, I don't know. I feel like I'm doing this on my own, as the only other person I know in college is at a uni and not a community college, and even though we both finished our first year I think at the moment I'm farther ahead than he is.

I'm 18, have two years of college done.
I could go to college about 2 hours away from home, or I could go to a branch campus about 15 minutes away from home. I want to go to the campus away from home because 
-they offer more degrees (not sure what I want to study yet)
-I've lived in my hometown forever and I want to experience being away from home
-I've always wanted to go to this school, and frankly I'm feeling pretty trapped in my hometown and I feel like it would be best for me to be away for a while.
Now here's my predicament: it costs about $10,000 more to go to the college away from home due to dorm costs. I did get a 4,000 scholarship and my dad is going to help me get through college but ultimately I will be taking out loans and paying them off after graduation. 
So, I could either:
A-go to my local college for a year and pay for an apartment instead of a dorm next year (about the same cost)
B- take a gap year and work to save up so I can attend the college away from town or,
C- go to the college away from town and graduate with debt.
So what should I do? I can't really get unbiased opinions here so I would appreciate any feedback! Thanks!

I have 100 credits, covering pretty much any general education requirement and consisting mainly of political science, history, and English classes since I was originally pursuing a degree in International Studies. I dropped out after going a little crazy my last semester and basically locking myself in my apartment and avoiding everything (which resulted in more problems than just dropping out of school, unfortunately). Two years later, I'm seeing a therapist and (relatively) mentally stable, I have a full-time job that pays well even if I find it sort of soul-crushing, have some money in savings, and I'm ready to finish that degree! I took two classes at a community college this spring while working, and managed to get A's in both, a success for me since I desperately need to raise my GPA at this point.

However, I'm not sure what to do next. According to the career/academic counselors at the community college, there isn't anything else I can really do there, so they recommend transferring to a four-year university. I can't receive an associate's degree from them even though I've met all of the class requirements because I don't meet the residency requirement (would need to take 6 more classes there, and that seems like a waste of money). However, my GPA is too low to transfer to the nearby state university. Even if I did transfer, the admissions counselor there suggested that it would be impossible to complete my International Studies degree there without quitting my job since they don't have online or evening courses. Changing my major wouldn't fare much better, and would require me to pay more and be in school for longer. Both counselors suggested looking into transferring into an online degree program to finish efficiently and have the flexibility to keep working, but they didn't offer any specific recommendations for schools. There aren't any in-state schools here that offer online programs for a Bachelor's degree.

So I'm looking for any advice or guidance on next steps at this point. I feel pretty lost, even after extensive googling. I really want to keep my job because it pays well enough and I need the money, and coming from a low-income family I've been completely supporting myself for the last several years. I'd also like to transfer to a school that would accept as many of the credits that I have as possible. Which online degree programs through reputable schools would accept financial aid (or at least not be oppressively expensive), have a flexible transfer credit policy, and accept admissions on a rolling basis? I know that even with 100 credits, I still likely have another year or two to complete my degree, but I'm looking to finish it in the most efficient way possible while hopefully offsetting the cost by working.

Now, my mom makes a very good amount of money (RIP FAFSA), but her credit is abysmal (years of running from bills will get ya), so I don't get aid and she can't co-sign a loan. It's similar for all of my co-signing candidates, not being able to co-sign for bad credit or not wanting to co-sign for multiple people (my siblings and cousins are all in school), but I think a lot of it boils down to them not trusting me to finish the degree and pay the loans back. Based on my grades in high school, I don't really blame them. I digress.

Effectively, this puts me in a spot where I'm weighing whether or not I can even attend school this semester. This is complicated further because I owe my old school $2,200 before I can transfer to my university, so, ideally, I'd like a student loan that can disburse before the year starts.

653,LittleBitSpooky,1491700121,/r/college/comments/64ak00/im_a_professor_this_is_what_i_tell_my_family/,"I know it is college season and many of you are picking a school or looking to switch schools. I see your questions and your comments on the front page of /r/college. Some of you have parents that went to college and some of you don't. Some of you are traditional and some are nontraditional with respect to age. Some of you are veterans and some have never had a job. I want to give you a piece of advice I give to my family members. You can take it or leave it, but don't discount what I say because you don't like it; I'm tenured, I've been doing this a very long time. I've spent nearly two decades now within the walls of a college in some capacity. 

**1. The top students in any field will get a job in their field, but the % considered ""top"" varies by discipline.** Jobs in editing are less plentiful than in engineering. Majoring in either does not ASSURE you a job, but if you are in the top percent out there, you will likely be hired. For English, that may be the top 5% and for engineering it is probably the top 60%. Just like anything else, it is supply and demand. If you aren't competitive within your major with your classmates then you likely aren't going to be competitive in the jobs designed for that major (unless you already have an ""in"" somewhere). That said, it doesn't mean you will be unemployed, as many jobs in retail still want a bachelor's degree. 

**2. College is expensive and many of you will waste money.**  If you are on this sub (or conscious) you know college is expensive. The average student loan debt in the US right now is around $30K for a bachelor's. This is about a $300/month loan payment for 10 years. In general, you can expect $100/month repayment for every $10K you take out. I see a LOT of students who are ROYALLY screwing themselves over here. Look at a few scenarios: you go to an expensive liberal arts school that costs you $100,000 over 4 years. You are literally owing more than most mortgage payments when you get out. Some of my students take out the maximum aid dollars and then go out to eat, pay for an expensive phone, new computers every year, and shopping trips. Some people say, ""yes, but I'll be a ____ and have plenty of money when I'm out."" Will you? Do you know how many students change their majors? Flunk out of classes/their major? Aren't the top whatever percent in (1) above that won't be competitive for those jobs? It's a LOT of people. Google tells me that 80% of students change their major at least once and 44% drop out (70% drop out of a 2-year college). The average job with a bachelor's earns about $50K/year (+/- $15K depending on the field). Your take-home pay after taxes will be around $35K-$50K depending on your location and tax bracket. Do you want a solid 1/4 of your income to go to student loans for the next decade? If not, read the following points.

**3. Don't waste money.** Unless you are in the top 1-2% getting very powerful, high ranking jobs with a bachelor's degree, the college you choose is largely irrelevant (think Harvard business school, and you have family connections on Wall Street). Regional public universities offer the most affordable education, and many are within a driving distance from home. You may want freedom from mom so you go away and live in a dorm for 4 years, but when you are 22, living back with mom because you have too much student loan debt, you'll wish you took my advice. Most of you will lose nothing by going the affordable route. You will still be a teacher, or an engineer, or a chemist, or a writer. Just be the top %. An exception obviously is if the local school does not offer the program you need. 

**4. Don't retake classes. Ever.** This means you have to take college seriously. Don't ever fail classes. Don't retake them. When you do, they still show up on your transcripts but the GPA is ignored by your school from the first time. A med school will see 3 hours of F in organic, followed by 3 hours of A, and average to 6 hours of C. You can't escape poor decisions. So be studious. Be serious. Don't ever fail a class. They are expensive. I see students wasting thousands of dollars in their classes by retaking them. It delays your graduation, it costs you money, and if you are on student loans, you'll literally be paying for classes you failed for a decade. This brings me to my next point.

**5. Know when to change your major.** Nobody, and I do mean NOBODY, wants a physician that has to do everything twice to get it right. I have a ton of students every semester that struggle in every class in their major (I'm in chemistry). They MUST be doctors though. So they keep taking the same classes over and over and over and... it is never going to happen. As I said, nobody wants the doctor that has to do everything twice to get it right. Pick a major that you are good at. It will help you do well in school, which will save you money in the long run. Develop reasonable career goals that fit your strongest attributes, not ones that will showcase your weakest. 

**6. Don't go to college if you don't want to.** I have a lot of students who waste a lot of money going to college because their parents wanted them to. Let me share a story. I'm 3 years older than my brother. He had a ton of learning issues and decided to pursue a trade (auto mechanic) while I spent a decade in college. My salary at 30 was the same as his salary at 30, but his lifetime earnings are more than mine since I took out 10 years of full time work to pursue studies while he was working full time. There are plenty of ways to be successful without a degree. 

 TL;DR Don't spend more money than absolutely necessary in college. Be smart and don't fail classes. Don't go to expensive schools. Don't fall into the ""real college experience"" bullshit that will keep many of you in poverty until you are well into your 30's.

She does not want to continue onto a bachelor's. Could she have somehow just kept signing up for classes and going? I told her to pickup the sleeve and call or stop at the admin office to see if she can ask if she got her associates but she is scared to bring light to her situation and they might somehow void it I guess. To me it sounds like a bunch of bs, she has the singed degree (sent in triplicate.) It's clear that it says as of this date (June 2016) they award etc. etc. Would they have sent it that far in advance just anticipating all was good? I can't imagine they would.

A bit of background she does not pay for school and never sees bills from School outside of books or misc fees, the state (WA, USA) pays for it somehow as she is physically and very slightly mentally disabled (cerebral palsy.)

656,blahhhhh90,1490074798,/r/college/comments/60lvn1/freaking_out_not_enough_time_to_study/,"Okay, so I'm a full time student. I take 6 full courses, all major required and intensive. (i'm a junior, 18 credits) and I work 3 part-time jobs. I can't quit the jobs because i need the money to pay for tuition and living expenses. I can't study part-time (too late, semester is already started anyways, but just mentioning it because it's not an option for the future) or take a semester off because i'm an international student (part-time isn't an option in my uni, and taking a semester off = losing my visa and to start again i would have to completely reapply to school all over again gotta love immigration policies) 

I have no social life like AT ALL, and the only thing that I spend time on for myself is working out in the morning or playing soccer with my uni's women's rec team 2x a week. these days only once a week because practice times interfere with my work schedule. 

I also have Lupus, which sometimes comes with it days at a time of pain and fatigue and brain fogginess that is unlike any other. Immense stress makes me really vulnerable to infections. While exercising is also stress on my body, since i started it's actually helped me so much. But making the time to exercise reduces not only my time available to sleep but also to study or even just sit and get my brain organized. 

I'm struggling with making the time to study, get adequate sleep, and take care of my health and eat and stuff too. I'm constantly walking into shit, forgetting and losing things, and forgetting what day it is or where i'm supposed to be. I'm usually a super clean and organized person too who's notorious for always having her shit together, so it's also stressful for me that i don't quite feel like myself.

I would quit soccer, but it's the only social interaction I get and the only thing that makes me happy and like...lets me get outdoors because every waking moment that I spend is in school, in the library, or at work. 

I've already barely passed 2 quizzes this semester, and that means that my chance at getting an A in those classes is already lost. I HAVE to get A's though...because I plan on going to grad school, and I need to raise my GPA to get a scholarship (scholarship = less necessity to work 3 part time jobs so....) 

so i'm writing here now because i'm desperate. I catch up on readings for classes when i'm standing in the sardine-packed subway going to and from work, and in between classes. I eat like once a day because i don't have time to cook anything decent or money to spare eating out. My weekends consist of me locked up in the library CATCHING UP on stuff i couldn't do during the week or the previous weekend...and i'm going insane trying to get back on track and be more adequately prepared for more surprise-quizzes. I already have 2 exam soon and i'm not even close to prepared nor do I know when i'll be able to spend time preparing without having to do it all at once last minute! 

[this is my timetable] (http://imgur.com/a/5r7qk)

it's spaced out in intervals of 15 minutes, and obviously doesn't include time spent eating, using the bathroom, having a conversation with someone that wasn't planned, running errands and cleaning and stuff that's not consistent. And the only reason I would choose to not go to the gym in the morning is because i need to sleep an extra hour longer. Otherwise, everything in there is fixed and I can't do much about it. When I get even 15 minutes off of my schedule i freak out because, like I said, my time is limited and precious. I can't even date anybody because i'm just too freaking busy to meet people. 

I care a lot about my grades, and I want to be perfect and be the best and smartest and create excellent opportunities for me to get into good grad schools...but I don't want to be tired and sore from sitting in a chair all day with poor posture and a weak body, or get fat and ugly from lack of exercise and self-care (which would also make dating in the future when i get more free time a hopeless endeavor) 

there MUST be a way, somehow, to balance this out without putting my health even more at risk or losing my mind. please help, I don't know what to do. I wish I could just win the lottery or get a big scholarship so I don't have to struggle like this. I can't even attend school colloquiums and special lectures because of work! I'm miserable but I can't quit now that I'm almost finished...all that money and blood,sweat and tears would be wasted. ",college,Freaking out.

Meanwhile, I got deferred from FSU, and got accepted to UF PACE (an online program from UF). My dad was REALLY upset about the fact that I couldn't get into the UF campus itself. He told me he wanted to call the school to try and change the admissions, because he said I couldn't do anything. But I told him that could really affect my chances of trying to make the school as a transfer from UCF to UF.

Then, he discussed on how UCF is really such a terrible school, and that I'm nothing but a ""Joe-blow person"" and how I'm not a scholar kid. I tried to assure him that I would make it to UF, but he gives me a whole spiel on how ""I'm going to ruin myself"" and how ""He was so much better than me going to his college"" before transferring to the military. Anyways, we had an argument, I was stating that I'm just only going to UCF to get my AA, but my dad wants me to go to UF. He states this due to the amount of college credits I should have, in which I have enough to become a sophomore in college. However, I only made it to UF PACE, and my father was really upset about that. Either way, I will (hopefully) transfer to UF from UCF at the as soon as I get my AA. But later on, my father tells me on how bad UCF is, and how I shouldn't go to a ""terrible school"" to transfer from, and questions why I am getting an AA from a university and transfer over. Then my father criticizes me on my timeliness for turning in my applications last minute, saying that colleges don't like last minute applications.

My father and I then argued on the cost, in which I just stated I will try to pay for college, but my father said that I can't handle both a job and college. He argued that as soon as he pays for college, he wants to see EVERYTHING I am doing (from grades and classes, to extra-curriculum) at school. At the end result, I want to transfer to either Northwestern or Chicago for medical school as soon as I get my Bachelor's, but my father doubts that I would ever make it there, and calls me the ""Joe-blow"" for it. He then later recorded me making a promise to make it to IVY league schools, in which would add a lot of pressure onto me, and wants me to hold on to that promise. I really am trying my hardest, and I have fell behind sometimes, but I am planning to try and make it ahead as well, but my father doesn't see it. My father argued that I will end up on the streets, and I just feel really annoyed as I try to focus my reasoning that I will try harder, but he doesn't believe so.

What am I going to do, this is too much pressure from my father, and I feel like I should just leave him and go to college without him. At the same time, I also will have to pay a heavy amount of debt when I have to go to med school, especially in the more prestigious colleges. But my father just doubts me ever so much. What do you guys think about this predicament that I'm in.

658,goodusernamesstolen,1489682878,/r/college/comments/5zrpsn/taking_a_leave_of_absence_because_of_finances/,"Hi!

So recently I've been informed that the college money situation in my family is worse than I thought. There are two of us attending college at once next year, and I assumed we would balance the total out via loans, scholarships, and whatever our parents contribute.

However, my parents recently reminded me that my brother is 17 and can't sign for loans himself. My parents refuse to cosign, so more of the college savings are going to him. Since I don't have a lot of scholarships, this means taking out more loans on my part. And try as I might, I can't justify taking out much more in loans than I already am, especially considering my field of choice (library science). I was trying to think of a way out of my conundrum when a solution hit me: I could take a leave of absence, take on a second job, and save up for a year.

Of course, this solution isn't perfect. My parents flipped out at the idea of me taking a gap year before I started school, so I can't imagine this would go over any better. Also, there's always the threat of not being able to go back, and I'd have to pay back some of the loans I've taken out. But it also has its benefits: I think a gap year would rejuvenate the love I once had for my university (which I lost after having a less-than-glowing first semester), and provide time for rejuvenation, etc.

Before I do anything sudden, I wanted to hear other opinions on this (that aren't my family's immediately negative ones). Is this an irrational decision? A good one? Thoughts?

ETA: I probably won't go the whole year without working on my degree. I'd definitely study for/take some CLEP exams while I'm out.",college,Taking a leave of absence because of finances?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5zrpsn/taking_a_leave_of_absence_because_of_finances/,1489700878.0

I go to State Technical College of Missouri and because it's a tech school I'm only here for 2 years. The thing is, I don't think it's right for me. I take welding and I enjoy it but I can't keep my grades up in my other classes. It's not that I don't pay attention, because I do, but it just seems like they're trying to teach us the things our high school teachers couldn't. I can't comprehend lessons (especially math) in my classes. I've tried getting tutoring but they just get annoyed with trying to teach me these things and eventually just start doing the assignments for me. That's why I stopped my tutoring. There's no point in me going just to pass each paper if I'm going to bomb each test. I don't have a rich family and now I'm thousands of dollars in debt. I want out but would need a job where I could actually start paying off my student loans and pay for the essentials like a place to live and food to eat. I can barely pay for that shit with my student loan money! I'll go days without eating because I just can't afford it. I've lived in Missouri for my entire life and only traveled out of the state a couple times (two times to be exact) I'm tired of the same damn corn fields and cow shit stench air. I want to be able to travel and that's why I picked welding as a career choice, but with my poor grades and not having any college staff or officials that will even try and help me on their own without pointing me in the direction of a different office it's impossible to figure out wtf this college shit really is. As far as I'm concerned, college is a trap to get your money and spit ya out just as dumb as you came in. I'm currently taking 16 credit hours this semester but was originally scheduled for 22 but dropped two classes because the college said I had to, then found out I was supposed to have one of those classes transferred and the other one was never even supposed to be dropped. That's what my councilor says anyway, but he even still pointed me into another office to talk to someone that knows just as much as I do. So if by any chance anyone is still reading this I have one basic question. What the actual fuck should I do? Should I keep paying this college and hope I find enough help to actually get through my classes or drop out? Dropping out seems like the smarter move for me but I have no job because my first class starts at 10am and my last class ends at 8:30pm.

660,BadMeetsEvil24,1489137039,/r/college/comments/5yl4rp/cost_of_attendance_limit_for_student_loans/,"Let me preface by saying this is a premature question as I have yet to meet with a finaid counselor since they're going over my paperwork.

I'm a transfer student and I quit my full-time job to go to my state uni. I funded these last two school semesters off student loans alone, no grant money.

Welp, turns out I'm going to run out of loan money by May. I always figured I'd be able to apply for more loan money but I was told that I reached my financial aid limit due to the cost of attendance.

I submitted a financial aid appeal (due to my quitting my job last year) and I was told it was approved, they're just making corrections to my previous FAFSA at this point. I was also told my EFC changed by a decent amount, meaning I may be eligible for the Pell Grant. So I'm waiting on that first.

However, I was told that since I took out loans already to cover the cost of attendance, any grant money I receive will be disbursed to my loans to pay them off and not directly to me.

Long-term that's a good thing I suppose, but I need money to cover May-August. My question is (and I will ask the counselor once we meet) if they award me say a $4000 Pell Grant, and then pay off $4000 of my student loan, can I then apply for $4000 since that reduced my cap? Or am I thinking about this the wrong way?

This is... dumb. You're basically encouraged during the orientation to *not* work as that will interfere with school, which it did, so I quit. But now I don't have enough money to cover the last few months because I didn't work. And there is a ""cap"" for loans so I can't get more. I might have to drop out to work full-time so I don't get kicked out on the streets. (For reference I am an independent student with decent credit and no parental support).

Now I am on the edge of transferring to a four year university and I planned to switch to a biomedical science program with a cell/molecular biology concentration. While looking the type of courses I am taking, I decide to also look to see opinions on whether the degree was worth it or not. 

Now I always planned to go post graduate and I knew I wanted to go into the biotech industry but I'm seeing a lot of comments of people saying that the degree that I am pursing is literally a waste of time unless I plan to go to medical school. I wasn't planning on going to medical school and I feel like I have wasted 2+ years in college.

This spring semester, I am taking 19 credit hours: Chinese II, Calculus II, Physics w/ Calculus I, American Government, and Principles of Biology w/ lab for biology majors. I have three more classes to take this summer to complete my AA degree. I am looking to transfer to University of Florida or Florida State's online computer science program Fall 17. Of course with a BS degree, you are required to take a science major class, hence why I am taking Principles of Biology. The first test I made a 61. Definitely not proud of it, but it happened. Test 2 material and class was going well, until all hell broke loose. First I was sick (to be known, I am the type of person who will go to work or school sick or not). Secondly, I needed to be available to talk with my husband (he is deployed and this was a very important stressful conversation). Finally, what is going on now, my father-in-law is in the hospital and because he recently moved here to be with us but my husband is deployed, I am the only one to take care of him. Again, situations, he is there because his heart condition is worsening, now to classify it as severe heart failure. My husband and I feel that this isn't something to bat an eye at. He can't be here for his dad, so of course I will be there. School is very important to me, so I sent out an email to all my professors letting them know what is going on. We had a test this week and I sent out an additional email to my biology professor asking to reschedule. I can write a paper in place of that test (totally fine), but he finally sent a response saying ""Your other concern is how your home life is going to impact your performance in school the rest of the semester.  That we need to discuss.""

This has been going through my mind on repeat with all of my classes. I can bite the nail, suck it up, and do the best I can with all that is going on. However, I am scared as to how my home life will impact school. To me, family always comes first. So far, I have missed three classes in biology. I am keeping up with the material, but I feel my lack of attendance no matter what the reason will end dire. If I stick with biology, I know if I live and breathe biology, I  could do ok, receiving a C or B. Even then with an unforseen future of family events, it would be a high risk to stay. If I withdraw, I could have a more maneagble schedule, to include potential emergencies. I am using Tuition Assistance through Air Force to help pay school and I am not clear on the repercussions a Withdraw would have. Not to mention how a W would look on my transcript. Right now my GPA is 4.0 and I am not worried about my other classes. Should I withdraw from biology or grin and bear it, potentially ending in low grade?

I've been pressured by my mom to stay in Korea but my dad wants me to go to America. I'd be going to community college then transferring as soon as possible. 

The reason why I'm struggling to decide is because the Korean education system and work environments?? I guess.. are not very good. I honestly do not think I will be happy if I stay here.. My friend that teaches English here mentioned that she has students that are in their late 20's, still unemployed and living with their parents. They're learning English to raise their specs and appeal for workplaces. 

I know I want to go back to America but until recently I've sort of just accepted my fate(which is having to stay in Korea due to financial problems). I don't know how to go about looking into financial aid and student loans..

I want to help out other disadvantaged students, but I don't know what people need. Since textbooks and lab gear are so expensive, and my university doesn't really have the resources for students to borrow them (i.e. there's only one of each textbook in the library and they're not online; too bad if 200 students need to borrow it at once), so I was thinking that I could buy some and donate it to the departments to borrow from.

I am pretty involved (helped found a new athletics supporters' club last semester, and I get special dibs to conference tournament and March Madness games) and have enjoyed that. I love the chill/laid-back atmosphere, the student culture/body (62% female at a coastal university), the strength of the Cameron School of Business, most of the people I've met, the sports teams, virtually everything.

However, recently one of my big plans (pledging a fraternity) fell apart prematurely and it's caused me to reconsider my place here. Despite being an incredibly extroverted person, I've struggled with social anxiety since my early teens, and the anxiety especially flares up with women. As many friends and acquaintances as I have here, I also apparently have a bit of a ""reputation"". A rep that almost cost me my bid from the fraternity in the first place (though I was eventually dropped for a very different reason) because of what a few girls might've said about me. I can't stand when women think of me negatively and I normally try to do whatever I can to at least prevent disapproval/dislike. I also have just heard rumors that I was ""banned"" from two other fraternities and that some sorority girl had a restraining order against me (which is weird, because if those *were* true then I would've known first). I'm just really questioning a lot of things right now. I've taken the step of getting counseling/therapy for my issues, which I do think will help. I also feel that my parents dropping their silly GPA requirement would help me finally TRULY enjoy being a college student here as well (especially after the frat issue), though I'd still have to discuss that with them.

Definitely beginning to open up to the idea of transferring. I wouldn't go back to my home state (bc fuck New Jersey honestly), but I am interested in Temple and UBuffalo. Going to school in Philly would be an interesting adventure for sure and I know that Temple's Fox School of Business is better, or at least higher-ranked, than Cameron. Currently have a 3.15 GPA as a second semester sophomore (which is far better than my high school GPA) and am close to officially declaring my major. My family has had financial issues for a while that has made it harder to really pay for school, but federal loans (mixed in with a couple of school-specific loans) have helped a lot. A move back to NJ, in addition to seeing many old scars resurface from high school, also would not solve any affordability issues (most NJ publics are almost as expensive as my current school despite not being as good academically, therefore they have a poor ROI value). While it would definitely suck to leave my current university and all my friends/connections behind, I do want to at least float those couple of apps around just to see what would happen. I know that if I do end up leaving, I would much rather have it be on my own terms as opposed to because my parents didn't like that I got a 3.2 as opposed to a 3.5. In the meantime, I will focus on my current class schedule (16 hours of GenEds/electives), my on-campus job in the university library, applying for summer internships, reapplying to be a freshman peer mentor for next semester (had to drop it at the start of last semester), and most importantly using therapy to help solve my problems. I just completed and sent in my school scholarship application last night, hoping to get some money from the general university and/or Cameron.

TL;DR: I love my school, but recent events/rumors have caused self-doubt and social anxiety to set in within the last week and I now am actually considering transferring.

After school I went to work in aerospace under my uncle's wing. It's been cool and its a secure job with a really great benefits but I want to go out and go to college, away from home. I live in Tacoma but I want to go up to Bellingham and attend whatcom then transfer to Western. 
As of lately ive been living with my dad and if I want to save up the money to get started there I need to move in with my mom and save more money (he makes me pay the gas, electric, utilities and cable bills). Sure I make good money for my age but also I'm 19.. I want to go out and hang out with my friends. I realize that moving away there would mean serious budgeting but that is okay because I need to go. My parents are horrible with money and don't make much and I think that's becuase they didn't go to college. My dad makes $60k a year and said that after he pays bills he has less than I do (he doesn't pay for anything truthfully, family says he always been bad with money). My mom says that I'll be able to get enough money with financial aid to support myself sparingly but I do still plan on getting a part time job!
I told my dad I'm moving out and he's pretty upset. The only thing that should be a huge problem is the car loan he took out in his name to get me a new car. It's about $2600 and we got it in November. If I moved to my mom's I'll able to put more money down on it each month, twice a month!!! But he wants me to go out and get a loan to take it off his hands. He tried to guilt trip me and say that if I didn't he would be displaced and all of this stupid stuff. That's not my problem, I want to go to school, I need to go to school. I see my grandfather giving my dad thousands of dollars to pay off his credit cards and then he goes back out to spend it all up all over again... I don't want to end up like my parents, I am certain that if the event were to arise in the future that I would NOT be able to depend on them financially.. I really think I could be able to do this and I want to do this so badly. My dad would most likely work with me on the loan, I don't think I could get a loan my credit isnt too nice (only because hed have me buy other things I also pay for my own car insurance and everything). No matter what, if I pay it on time or early (the bills) he just isn't happy with it and won't be. He'd get in my face and violent about money and bills anyways. My mom isn't too much better but in a different way, she's just crazy; I moved out of there because she would verbally abuse me. But just 4 months of putting up with it all I could pay off that car loan, save up $2000-$3000 and then go to school and create a future of financial independence! I need to do this!! My family on my dads side is dissapointed in my decisions and keep telling me to think it over so I said I would.. I can't ever make any of them happy and this is about me this time!!! My dad's upset because he has to be responsible or lose a house, my grandparents upset because I don't want to take care of my dad and because I already have a really great job and my uncle just doesn't want me to fall into debt. I have to do all of this myself because my family just can't support me financially but I know that I will succeed and when I have my own kids I'll be able to put them through college. The first in my family to go to college and they're all fighting me... What should I do?

672,Davidrlz,1486626173,/r/college/comments/5syozo/i_dont_even_know_if_i_can_pursue_being_a_doctor/,"Let me start off by saying, I love college, I really do, but I've been feeling down in the dumps and I don't know where else to post this, let's start at the beginning. I went to a state university in NYC with a Biology Major and hoped to be a M.D. I had a part time job as a busboy/expeditor and found success early on, I was able to shift into college mindset pretty quickly, the only real problem was when I got hit by a car walking out of campus (broken humerus, dislocation, and tears in my ligaments), Thankfully, my broken arm didn't deter my studies and I received a 3.5 GPA. I was ecstatic, I applied myself and got a GPA I wanted and my general shit confidence was able to go up a bit. My second semester was identical to the first(replace job with physical therapy for aforementioned wound), It was my first ""challenge"", I took Bio I, Calc I, and Chem II as my main courses(I believe I had 2 others, but they were ultimately insignificant), I got a 3.5 GPA again, and even started working in a research lab as a freshman where I worked under an amazing graduate student who taught me many neuroscience techniques, I loved it so much that the Summer between Freshman Year and Sophomore year I went 8 hours a day(typical work schedule) during weekdays to work. By the time I reached Sophomore Year, I had my first taste of Upper level classes, I ended up taking only 3 sciences(It was really the only thing I could take, it was Physics I,Orgo I, and Gen Bio II), and had my research formally added as a class for elective credits. I managed, yet again, a 3.5 GPA(A in Bio, C+ in orgo, and B+ in physics I), my orgo grade disappointed me but I believed I could apply myself even more-so, I had many connections and friends in my old university, and carefully planned out my next 5 semesters into(hopefully) Medical School. Then it all came crashing down. My parents got interested in a house in North Jersey, it was nice, bigger than our old one, but it is obviously a big commitment and came with a lot of problems, and mortgage was higher. Without going into detail, we worked with a family friend so my dad would change jobs, and help him with owning restaurants, and we found out about the move in November of my first sophomore semester (the orgo semester), It was too late to transfer to another college, so I told myself I would take a semester off, it would be easy I thought, I can study orgo, study for the MCAT earlier, and be productive, nothing happened. Being away from all my friends, not doing any work at all drove me insane. This house of mine became a prison(didn't help I couldn't find a job from Jan-Mar), I eventually got a job at Dunkin' Donuts(it was miserable there too, it also negatively affected my back, more on that below), I eventually applied to a university nearby my house and got in with a transfer scholarship, I was very happy, I finally felt like my life was back on track after so long, I was thirsty for knowledge and ready to tackle the obstacles ahead of me, I went ahead and registered for Orgo II, Cell Biology, Japanese I(needed a language a this college, and I always liked the language), and a History class. I started off strong in my classes, and even though i stumbled from being rusty, and unfamiliar with concepts, and I had my overall worst semester(this is fall of last year), I got a B in Cell Biology, a C in Orgo II, an A- in history, and an A in Japanese, It made me sad, for two reasons, 1) It's not good enough for Medical School, and 2) A professor I wanted to work(also my advisor) said that it'd be in my best interests not to start research again until my GPA is a 3.5 or higher(which makes sense), so it hit me hard, especially my self-esteem, which was already pretty low from my depression after moving. I told myself I was ready for next semester, I re-evaluated my study habits over winter, took only 1 Science class, and filled the rest with my gen-ed requirements. My current semester is now Japanese II, Genetics, Mathematical Models, Understanding Japanese Popular Culture, and another history class, it was supposed to be a ""rise of the ashes of sorts"", but I didn't pay attention to my familial situation. My father ended up getting a restaurant of his own in October of last year, I was oblivious to what was happening since I assumed he was fine, he watched how to do the job for about half a year after all, but the restaurant was not taken care of by the old owner, my father has been trying hard to bring it back, but his hopes are too high at the moment. He isn't happy, and he takes it out on others, condescending comments are always thrown my way(from my mother too), he asks me to work on less than 24 hour notice after college(ruining my plans for studying, etc.) and making me fall behind on my coursework, and since I now have chronic back pain(which work makes worse) I can't work out and I've been gaining weight, lowering my self-esteem(and receiving more condescending comments from parents), so basically, I am now working way too much(this week alone is going to be over 40), have crippling physical health issues(I don't even have time to schedule an appointment for my back), and bad mental health(from my shattered confidence, self-loathing, and not being able to succeed in college), and from all these effecting my schoolwork( the only thing I was ever good at), I now have nothing, I just want to vent, I just want advice, I want to know how to cope with having your dreams shattered in front of your eyes over circumstances you can't control, ultimately, I just want to be myself again.",college,I don't even know if I can pursue being a Doctor anymore.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5syozo/i_dont_even_know_if_i_can_pursue_being_a_doctor/,1486644173.0

I took a year off after high school to work full time to pay for my gender transition, to save some more money for school and also because I was not 100% sure of what I wanted to do and I'm honestly still not 100% sure but I have a better idea now than I did. So my year off came to an end and my parents started pressuring me about school. They suggested I go into a certain program they thought I'd be good at that so I said sure. I ended up going to the only school in my city that offered the program, actually it's one of only a few in the Canada that offer it so my choices weren't abundant from the start but supposedly this school is known for it, not really sure if that's true or not. I went because it was convenientt, cheaper than going away, I was still unsure of what I wanted to do and I was still paying for my transition so I still needed money and the place I work at offered part time hours and it payed more than minimum wage and jobs aren't always for trans people to get so I was scared of leaving it (I got the job pre-transition). I was also scared of leaving my friends because they're awesome and have always been 100% supportive.

Anyways so I go and I live in residence for my first year to get the university experience. Both of my parents lived in residence when they went to college so they were both very much advocates for the university experience so I stayed on residence even though I lived close by

Residence was boring. I met some great people but it was such a let down. There were no party's at all and nobody really let loose. All I've heard about college from my parents and from society was that it's a blast and I'm so disappointed because it's been anyhing but. It sucks because my brother just went off to university this year and he loves his school and he parties and is just enjoying the typical college experience.

As I mentioned before, I hate the school. I never wanted to go here in the first place. I don't necessarily hate my program but I'm not in love with it either. However my marks have only gone downhill since first year and I don't know my exact GPA but it's not good. I'm not really sure what to do, I don't think I can go back to my school in September but I don't think my marks are good enough to transfer to a school I'd actually want to go to. When I think back to highschool I was set on going to school in Ontario or BC. My marks were all in the high 80s and 90s so I could have gone and probably to a higher ranked school than I'm at now and I'm kicking myself for not because if I apply somewhere else now, I can't really use those marks because I'm already in university. Honestly if I wasn't transgender and in the midst of transitioning after high school, I wouldn't have taken a year off and I would've have gone to the school I wanted and maybe had the college experience I dreamed of and I wouldn't have felt the need to stay in the same city even after my year off. I've done 3 semesters but with the dropped classes and couple of F's it's basically two semesters. Basically my questions are:

1. Does anyone else feel like they made the wrong choice for school or feel disappointed by their experience? How did you deal with it?

2. Is it too late for me to go somewhere I actually want to go to and have the ""college experience""? What would be the best way to do so with my marks being less than stellar?",college,I hate my school,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5rym3t/i_hate_my_school/,1486198187.0

I pretty much have to take Calculus I in the summer. I could take Calculus II in a different summer session, but I'm not confident in my math skills, I know Calc II is apparently the hardest. On top of that I still have 3 science classes I need to take. 

My options:

* 1: Take Calc I in Summer I, a science in Summer II (which happens during I and summer III), Calc II during summer III. 2 science classes for the fall semester, maybe Calc 3. 

* 2: Take Calc I in Summer I and just take 2 sciences for the other sessions. Calc II and 1 science in fall.

Should I even take Calc III? I know, you can't go wrong with more math in CS, in fact, the field I want to go in (AI) pretty much requires a lot of advanced math...but I really don't want to cram my classes during University. I was thinking I could guide myself using MIT OpenCourseware, Paul's online math notes, YouTube, reading textbooks etc. Is that even realistic?

I will most likely take additional math classes of course, but I value time for clubs and gym, focusing on my classes, maybe taking extra electives. Don't have a social life so that isn't a problem. I'll be taking an unrelated minor which needs 7 classes, (not changing my mind on that) and 3 other required math classes that aren't offered at my CC, so yeah, I'm afraid of pushing myself too hard.

I think a minor, 3 extra math classes on top of that wouldn't be too bad to achieve, but I heard double majoring is better than 2 minors. But the double major is 7 classes. If I graduate in 5 years, that's 18+ credits each semester. 

TDLR; Is it possible to self-teach advanced math through online resources instead of actual classes?

So I'm currently a freshmen in my second semester going to the University Of Akron. I come from a town about an hour away called Youngstown. Because of this, I live on campus. I chose this school because it was a nice school and  had a pretty good program for my major. At the time we didn't realize how expensive it was, (We mis-read and thought the price of one year was all four years). My dad left when I was like 2 so I'v never had one, but my mother does well. She makes a good amount of money so we live comfortably. We are not wealthy by any means, we have enough though, but because of this, even know she is a single parent with  2 kids we barely get anything from the FAFSA which is a bit ridiculous IMO. Anyways, she is constantly saying things like it's too expensive and stuff to like everybody and even to me, then re illiterates saying but, go there, I'm not going to make you come back ( and go to the local college, Youngstown State University) if you really don't want too, but it just sucks knowing how expensive school is and stuff. So I have a few questions.





First off, I don't mind going back to YSU at all, it's not that big of a deal to me, so my questions are.




If I go back, how hard is the transfer process, like how difficult would it be switching ( for the fall semester).






If I go back home that cuts the cost by a lot, as I'll be living at home, but in the end, how much student debt is the difference between them? Akron with room &amp; board: (	$11,064 ) + Tution (10,260), versus YSU Tuition ($8,087.28). This stuff confuses me a little, so I'm not sure exactly how it works, but I believe ATM I pay about 8k a semester. So how much difference of debt would this end up being?




How are would it be to get back on track? I'm assuming they don't offer the exact same classes, so are all the classes I'v already taken useless? 




And lastly; What is the difference between schools for future employers? I'v heard state schools are better, but I'm fairly certain Akron is a better school, would the difference between these schools be a big factor? Like would a possible employer look the other way because I attended YSU?

I did my research, saw the salary, job security, etc. I started my freshman year last fall and the new semester just started. Unfortunately for me, I had to take semester C which was a 6 week semester because my financial aid would never process due to personal reasons. It finally went through, but I could only choose between some basic classes. I took Understanding Visual Arts, English 1, Western Civ 1, and Economics. Econ was terrible and I know it would help with my major. So this semester I finally got into an accounting class. I am taking Accounting 1, English 2, Environmental Science, and Religions of the World. I dread my accounting class. The professor is wonderful though, so I know it isn't her. I am 18 right now and have an office job, but I realized it sucks my soul away. I can't do this forever. Let me tell you my original plan.

I was going to get my Associates degree in Accounting, take a job as a bookkeeper, and then save so I can afford a university and get my Bachelors degree.


Then I would take a job at a firm and make decent money. I don't want to work a desk job forever though because I think I would be a good professor. I came up with the idea of getting my PhD in Accounting. The starting salary is amazing and there is not enough people getting this degree. It is needed. The issue is that I would be in school until I'm nearly 30 if I went this route. I would spend so much money making myself unhappy. I also realized the only reason I chose accounting is because it makes great money. I literally based my major on the pay scale.



I can't make myself unhappy forever doing something I hate. I want to get a degree that lets me get a job where I can contribute. All I want to do is help people, my family, and myself. I don't want to live in a world where I work the corporate 9 to 5 routine. I crave to contribute to a world, planet, and society that is slowly getting worse. I wanted to be a teacher so bad, but not in accounting. I hate math. I love history, reading, writing, helping, traveling, creating, using my imagination, exploring, business, space, the environment, art, and just enjoying the moment. I know I can't get a useless degree. I feel like I might even dislike teaching. I used to want to be a business major because my dream is to own my own business, my creation. I can pick my schedule and work from home sometimes based on what I do. I know there is no easy way out, but I'm at rock bottom. I feel so sad and college is just making things worse.

I suffered from severe depression and just lost myself these past few years, I was nothing but a shell. Stayed with a mentally abusive girlfriend for almost 2 of those years and just forgot who I was. I technically dropped out after spring semester of 2014. I'm majoring in Biology traditional track at a County College and hopefully going for my bachelor's after that. I left school because there was simply too much going on for me to deal with, family fighting all the time when I got home, money problems to pay rent constantly, my ex-gf and I also fighting and I just gained a boatload of weight and felt like I had nothing to live for.

 The part I'm kicking myself the most about is that that spring semester was one of my best, I only had maybe 3 more classes left after that but I got a D in one class(Chemistry 2 Lecture) and just gave up. I originally was a pretty bad student, after my first year I got a 2.0 and was having trouble keeping up but then I said ""Fuck it, what do I have to lose if I try my hardest and fake it till I make it"" and eventually my grades started to go back up and ended up with a 3.0 my spring semester. That spring semester I was part of the executive staff for the student gov, part of college council, head chair for al clubs in my school and everyone came to me for questions, I felt like I was on top of the world. I was on a scholarship and getting that meant that I would be on academic probation. Then fall semester came around, I started to focus more on my gf at the time because she had mental health issues(abused, problems with physcially abusive mom/ex bf) that she had to deal with and just got scared to apply for fall semester then since I saw all of my friends transferring and I just felt like the biggest failure out of anyone I know. 

    Then spring 15 came around and I still didn't apply again... I stopped emailing my scholarship guy even though he emailed me, I never checked my emails out of fear and severe anxiety didn't bother keeping in touch with him since I was afraid of knowing whether or not I'd lose my scholarship over it. I'm usually that big guy with a big smile always on his face who likes to joke around with his friends and is always ready to help, I didn't want anyone to feel bad for me so I pretty much faked that smile for 2.5 years. I love motivating people and getting them to feel better about themselves, it's one of the few things that truly make me happy. I just couldn't motivate myself to get past that anxiety and depression though, I was stuck.

Fall 15 comes and goes by, then spring 16(finally broke up with my ex) and then finally Fall 16, I think about it and the days for registering comes so I finally gather up the courage to go register for classes on the first day of school but apparently after the first day of classes happen you can't pick them up anymore and you can only drop them( previous policy allowed to pick up classes up to 10 days after classes start) I just had a panic attack and left. I was depressed and anxious for a week, my life was in shambles. 

By this time I'm dating another girl who's 22 extremely supportive, intelligent and very happy and is almost done with her psych degree from a very difficult school. We're both from the east coast and she's going to school in the west, she inspired me so much when she let me visit her at her school and I just got a little spark under my ass. I can't wait around any longer, I want a life with her and I want a life for myself. I need to be successful, I need to be the old me, but the best version of me again. I want to have a family, have a career in medicine and buy my mom a house where she can retire to, take care of my older brother if he ever loses a job or is going through something tough. I feel like a failure right now, at my rock bottom but I needed to get my ass up and go apply for spring 17, I got in contact with my scholarship guy( extremely hesitant to speak to me again) but eventually met with me. I told him everything that was going on and has been nothing but a positive influence to me this whole time and I'm extremely grateful for that. 

My gf is working hard and motivates me to do better too, I decided to finally give it a try again and found out that I'm only 3-4 FUCKING CLASSES AWAY FROM GRADUATING WITH MY ASSOCIATES IN BIO. I was ecstatic, I couldn't believe it so I finally applied. I work full-time so decided to go and take 2 classes(technically 3 with lab) only since I'm moving out this may and needed money still. I finally went back to class this morning for the first time and got destroyed with all of this new information. I have to take genetics and genetics lab as well as chem 2 lecture and it's so much information, I used to be great at bio and remember some stuff but we had to take a quiz to see where we're at and I'm sure I got a 20 on it today. I felt miserable after, disgusted with myself and now I don't know what to do. The professors are awesome but I feel bad bothering them for help, I don't have a car so it's difficult coming to their hours as well. I just needed to share this with someone since I'm terrible at sharing my problems with people out of fear of disappointment and people just leaving me.

Where do I start? I used to be awesome at studying but this is truly scaring me. It's a whole lot of information until my next monday class... Thanks for reading if you managed to get this far.

So i've always been a good student, ive taken 10 AP classes, all A's/a few high Bs, but my class rank is only around top 20% because I go to a very competitive school.

I applied to around 9 colleges and got into all of them except 1, University of Texas(but I wasn't planning on getting in anyway) I planned to go to UNT and study communications.

My parents aren't going to help me pay for college, so I was planning on relying on FAFSA and loans. However, we got back the FAFSA papers and i'm not eligble to take out the loans because of money issues my parents had a few years ago. So I have a very small amount of money for college, and would basically have to take out all private loans.

My parents think I should go to the local community college and try and transfer to University of Texas, and live at home to try and save money, but I guess I just feel like I would be missing out. I know this probably seems obvious, but should I do that or try and go to a 4 year university and take out loans?

I just want to know if anyone has gone through the same thing. I can't help but feel jealous when all my friends are going to 4 year universities and prestigious colleges with their tuition payed for by their parents when I can't even go to a small college because of money issues that happened when I was a small child. I feel bad for being jealous.

682,Lemon_pop,1484120738,/r/college/comments/5nax1d/is_it_possible_to_go_from_lazy_undisciplined/,"I am honestly a bad student. Somewhere in junior high I stopped putting so much effort into school. This was around the time I got my first gameboy and game cube. I started procrastinating homework and school. By the time I hit high school, video games was just about all I did.

Almost any assignment that required some kind of work I blew off. By taking easy courses I barely managed to graduate with a 3.0 GPA. 

For a year I did nothing but work and game/ browse reddit/jerk off. Then I quit my job to go on a trip overseas and blew a bunch of money that was supposed to be for school. After several months of doing nothing, my parents said I had to get a job, go to school, or pay rent.

So I start school at a local community college that conveniently is completely paid for by financial aid. I tell myself this time will be different, I'll do better now. But every time I have a choice between school work and reddit/video games, the fun stuff wins. And before long, I'm spending 20 hours a week browsing reddit inside classrooms.

Of course my grades drop. Somewhere around this time I decide go to university. When I fail out of community college, that's fine, I'll do better at *university*.

Now here I am at university. First year I get nothing but F's. Doing things outside class is too hard, then doing things at class is too hard, then showing up to class is hard.

So now I'm on probation. One more bad semester and I'm gone. So I tell myself, OK now's the time things get better. I start counseling and medication for depression. I retake the classes i failed and this finish the semester with an A a B and 2 C's.

What was the difference this time? I was able to make myself go to class, and 70%of school work could be done in minutes by googling the questions. So with those two I was able to survive. 

Which brings us to now, my 4th semester of university. 3 of my classes should be easy. The other 2 are reading and writing heavy, known for difficulty. Already I have several hundred pages to read, and papers coming up soon. But every time I sit down to do these assignments, I just can't. After only s couple minutes I alt tab to reddit or fire up the ps4.

I guess I've never really acquired the discipline to be a good student, never figured out how to push myself through unpleasant things. So now I don't know what to do. I've been in a rut for so long.

And man, all that is only a part of problems. Aside from the ever present depression, the social anxiety, poor self esteem, never having had a girlfriend or sex, extreme discomfort with how out of shape I am, and a sneaking suspicion I might have aspergers

I'm a Biology major with a minor in mathematics at a private school in upstate New York, but I started my educational path at a community college as a nursing major. That year that I spent as a nursing student meant that when I switched, none of the science classes counted towards my new major, so I've been taking above 20 credits and working 30-40 hours a week for the past 3 years. It has been hard.

My mental health has suffered, my relationships to my friends and my boyfriend of 4 years has suffered but I always knew it would be worth it if I could avoid taking an extra year of school (and all the debt that comes with it). I've been saving for years and I'll be able to pay off all my debt when I graduate. It's a gift I always wanted to give myself.

Now my problem is that my last semester is going to be more than 20 credits as well, not including my job as a mathematical modeling consultant to a private firm, and my two research internships with the County Medical Examiner, and a private mentor respectively. The courses I'll be taking are no joke either, because I'm soo out of sync with the rotation of classes, I'll be taking Organic II, Molecular Biology, Physics II, Evolution (not hard, but jerk professor) and an ethics class. The crux of this is that I took organic chem I at a community college TWO YEARS AGO, but they physically wouldn't let me into the class before now and it's only because I went back to the old professor and got a letter.

The orgo II class at this private school is supposed to be insane, and the tests/finals are cumulative from the orgo I class that I didn't take here. So I've been looking over the notes from the orgo 1 class and using khan academy to review, but I really don't know any of this. The professor sent out a homework assignment due the first day of class, and if it were a test, I would get a zero. I wouldn't even be able to guess. 

I have looked into taking it at another school this semester but it's impossible as every time it's offered conflicts with my schedule. My other option is to graduate with the 4 credits missing, and take it next fall or spring at my community college and transfer it in. My main issue with doing this is I'm not sure if anyone would hire me knowing that I still need to take a class, or if that would make a future schedule even more crazy rather than just biting the bullet and praying to pass. I have a 3.6 gpa from my private school and a 3.998 from the community college where I got my associates, I just feel a bit overwhelmed and would love to hear from people who may have some experience.



TL:DR: Organic II class at private school is cumulative from orgo I, I took orgo I two years ago at a different school and the material focused on was different. Can't decide whether I should muscle through it and take the hit to my GPA, praying I pass, or graduate with the credits missing and take it at my old school.

A little bit of back story in case anyone can help/has experienced this before. It's kind of long but bear with me. I'm still a little frustrated and confused but I want to figure this whole thing out. 

So I was previously attending an online university, and had a few issues come up with my FAFSA eligibility, etc. I am 23 and although legally I am independent and I am independent as according to the actual written rules of the FA thing, after filling it out, it puts me in the dependent category. I am unable to ask for or receive any help or financial information from my parents. So that makes things a little more difficult when verifying dependence or whatever. But I contacted my school financial department as soon as I found out to start fixing the problem. 

(I noticed there was no award letter coming up, and even though I asked multiple times if something was wrong, the school said everything was fine!) 

Turned out it was due to an IRS audit supposedly and I had to do a bunch of verification worksheets. I turned these into the school four different times and each time got no response or information upon calling or emailing. Everyone just told me ""looks like everything is fine, just wait"" or ""we aren't exactly sure, you could try submitting it again!"" 

The whole deal was that I submit the paperwork and within three to five days, my Financial Aid is updated and the term I was enrolled in would be paid for. Repeatedly, I asked to make sure this was true as I couldn't pay a few thousand out of pocket just because they took forever. Again I was reassured and then not contacted or responded to again until the day before the term ended when I got an email that said ""something doesn't look right with your paperwork so we need another form done"". 

The school basically waited until the very last minute: when the term was over, to continue looking into my paperwork even though I had sent it in multiple times and been in contact with several point persons to ask what else they needed or if everything was going well. They and I NOW know at this point, there is no way to pay for that term with financial aid or tuition assistance. 

Of course I was contacted by the credit department a week later claiming that I needed to pay the whole balance immediately. I had been thinking of switching schools for a while, as everything at this one seems to be a run-around no matter what... but now they're not allowing me to request official transcripts and won't answer when I ask questions like this. One dept refers me to another and back, so on and so forth. 

I just kind of feel like they intentionally screwed me over or took advantage of the fact that I put trust (which I think a student should be able to have in their school) in them to do this right. They knew my financial situation because almost every term there's been some slip up where I've had to warn them that I wouldn't be able to pay for things out of pocket. 

I have been applying to other colleges but I can't submit transcripts so it's like I'm at a standstill and their neglect is affecting my ability to continue my education. 

I don't mean to complain so much or sound whiney but it's been a long frustrating ride! If anyone else has experienced something like this or gone to the same school (SNHU) I'd really appreciate some help or advice. If not, anyone that knows what legal action or advice can be taken would be just as useful. I have emails documenting most of this, but not the phone call recordings of course.

I'm in my first year at community college majoring in English and I have a 4.0 GPA so far, but I hope that when I transfer I really want to double major in mathematics, and I've tried taking math classes now just to prep. I actually didn't pay attention in math in high school but now that I've been doing it I realize it's something I really love lol. I know it's really early to tell since I plan to transfer as a sophomore but I was wondering if I could have help just ... generally laying out a goal for transfer. I went to a pretty good public high school, but my grades were pretty bad freshman and sophomore year because something bad happened freshman year that sort of wrecked me emotionally; by junior year I had learned to cope and I graduated with 3.9 weighted GPA. I didn't apply to a lot of schools because to be frank, I really didn't know where to start - my parents weren't born in the US and didn't really complete a lot of college, only as much as they could while they were also supporting their families, and so they can't really give me advice. My college counselors would try to help, but they also had to deal with a lot of other kids, so I didn't feel like I got the help I needed, so I just ended up applying to UCLA, UCSD, UCSB, NYU, and Sarah Lawrence. I got into all of them except UCLA, but even with aid I just couldn't afford the tuition, and I ended up going to community college.

I feel really stupid because I really don't know where to start researching colleges to transfer to at all. I can't really ask my family because of what I said already, and besides them, I don't know who else to really turn to. I've been considering applying to privates but I feel sort of hopeless, since everyone says there's no real point if you're coming from community college, and if anyone could offer input on that, it'd be really cool of you. Financial aid-wise, I've been working a bunch and I've saved up enough to at least make a dent in my tuition, but I'd still need financial aid, since I can't really rely on my family too much. I'm a little intimidated by loans but I'm willing to go for them this time. If anyone could offer suggestions on what to do from here too, I'm all ears.

Sorry if this is wordy ... because I'm still a freshman in college, I tried to include background about high school to give more info, but idk if it's even that relevant. Thanks so much!

I ended up going to my backup school, the University of Kansas, when every single other college I applied to denied or waitlisted me. This was humbling to say the least as a lot of my self-worth came from my academic performance and perceived superior intellect.

I still had hope when I first started at KU. Then, the more classes I took, the more majors I explored, the less motivated I became.

So I'm 20 years old. Should be a Junior at my university, but still classified as a Sophomore because of some failed courses. Freshman year, I didn't really know what I wanted to do. I didn't exactly have a passion for anything, and wasn't sure where I wanted to go in life. I did however, love using my computer, and when I researched Computer Science, the idea of being able to code and create things from nothing using a computer grabbed my attention. Plus, the pay in the field was something I felt my parents would be proud of, so I decided at the end of Freshman year that I'd major in Computer Science. 

Come Sophomore year, I started taking some of the required MATH and GEEN courses for the major, and while the information I learned from the GEEN courses interested me enough to look into it, I hated MATH. I've always hated math, whether because I never got a proper understanding of it while I was younger, or I'm just not a mathy type of person, I struggle with it. I failed Calculus I at the end of Sophomore year, and retook it again this semester (what should be me first semester as a Junior) but failed it again. I also failed GEEN 165 for the second time, the second required course for CS. 

A few things happened between Sophomore year that threw me into a depression that didn't involve school, but ultimately made me reevaluate my life and where I wanted to be. I knew I wasn't happy with the person I was, and I wanted to improve and grow. I came out with the dream goal that I've always had since I was little, wanting to understand people. How they think, why they behave the way they do, and help/heal them in order to allow them to understand and find themselves. Turns out, this is the blueprint of Psychology. Over the summer of Sophomore year, I really delved into the study of Psychology and turns out I fucking love it. I finally felt like I understand a little of what I want to be, and had the first step to developing my life plan. 

My third year came, and as I said, I failed Calculus I and GEEN 165 for the second time, but by that time, I had concluded that CS was not for me, and I wanted to look into changing my major to Psychology. I talked it over with my parents, and at first they were surprisingly supportive. My advisor tried to recommend maybe I try IT since I wasn't too good with math, and not abandon the Technology field all together, but was also ultimately supportive. However, over the past few weeks, my parents have been pressuring me more and more to just finish up with CS, or something else Technology based in order to get my degree on time. Suggesting that I could go back to school and get my Psychology degree later. 

This sudden change in heart hurt me, as in the beginning, they were supportive of my change. It wasn't easy for me to come to them and say I wanted to change direction so close to my fourth and final year of school, and they made me feel so much better about my choice when they were there to lend a hand. Now it feels like the pressure got to them, and they're backing out. 

The catch with this situation I'm in, is I'm in school under my mothers GI Bill, so my four years of school are paid for by the military. On my mothers side, she says she doesn't want me to have to amass debt and deal with that stress. Whereas my father states that my mother is paying for her school out of pocket while using her GI on me, and changing majors all of a sudden and possibly not graduating on time would be a like a slap to the face towards her. 

I'm aware that while I've found what makes me happy, changing majors so late would keep me in school at LEAST an extra year that we'd have to pay for. I understand that getting my degree is ultimately what they want, but I can't help but know that I love isn't in technology. It's an interest at the most, but not something I'd dedicate my life to, and I'm afraid that the lack of passion would only drive me lower in terms of grades as I'm majoring in something I don't like. My Advisor suggests IT, my parents suggest Management Information Systems as it isn't as taxing on math, yet all I can think about is doing Psychology. 

What should I do?

School is paid for, for four years under mother's GI Bill, and parents want me to graduate on time with a degree in order to avoid having to take out loans and pay debt.

Cost of gas and even some significant repairs along the way, if necessary, would still be a lot cheaper than living on my own. 

Time is a huge concern. That's 3 hours of time each day gone on driving. I would try to stack my classes for as few days as possible during the week, but there's no guarantee that I could limit myself to two or three days a week. Hopefully it would be no more than 4 days a week. I would be going for computer science, and I've already done a bunch of prereqs  at CC so this would hopefully only be 4 semesters of commuting. 

Another concern is my car. It's kind of a piece of crap. If it breaks down I'll be screwed. If I can't get to the school I'll fail all my courses. I have very little money. I can pay for repairs that cost a few hundred bucks, but if something really costly came up it would be game over. So that worries me. 

Any advice is appreciated.

692,MightBeDementia,1483045359,/r/college/comments/5kz8hv/little_brother_wants_to_go_to_college_for_music/,"Hey guys, I've been pretty torn thinking about this. My brother wants to go to the same school as me which is a public state school in NJ. He wants to go for Music Composition....but he'd be looking at the same amount of debt that I would (which is about $70,000).

The difference is, I'm majoring in Computer Science and am going to be making enough money out the gate that I can pay my loans back within 3 years. There is no guarantee he even gets a job with that major, and if he gets one it won't pay much. He's a great musician though, and writes great music and he plays many instruments and he is a hard worker.

But I'm not sure if college is for him. If you're gonna succeed as a musician, you don't need college for that. But I don't want to be the one to interject and tell him this and then he stays in our hometown working a shitty part time job and because of my influence he lives in a world of mediocrity with no skills besides his music. That would kill me.

But what's worse? That or the debt? What if the debt ends up being worth it because he meets the greatest friends of his life, or makes music connections at school he wouldn't have otherwise and succeeds in his field? Why can't he just major in something else and pursue music as a minor?

There's so many variables and I don't want to be the pioneer of them....I'm just torn on what to do here.

693,BlkWhiteSupremecist,1482804040,/r/college/comments/5kh5mc/22_years_old_will_be_23_in_fall_2017_transferring/,"Did a year at a university right out of high school with no clue what I actually wanted to do. Paid ~$9,500 out of pocket for that year. Took a gap year and worked ~60 hours a week. Moved states, when I got here I went to a CC (my 3rd year, 2nd in this program) and I finally feel confident in what I'm doing. I'm transferring to a 4 year school in fall 2017 to get a bachelor's in finance. I'm in a connected degree program and I'm fulfilling the 4 year school's requirements. I'm also getting my applications out of the way now (they just opened like last week) so I have a good chance at getting accepted according to my CC adviser.

I'm weighing whether I want to commute (45 miles each way) or stay on campus. Since I've never stayed on a campus before, I want to try to broaden my perspective. Right now, I'm leaning heavily towards at least staying on campus my first semester.

The two biggest enticements to staying on campus are: 1. networking, increased time and desire to participate in extra-curricular activities that'll help in my career aka clubs, study groups, etc, and 2. obviously social life. I want to taste the college experience. 

Another significant pro to consider is the 2 hours per day that I have class I'll be saving. If I stayed at home I would continue working ~25 hours a week in retail. I'm very disciplined with my time management, but an hour commute twice a day where I can't really accomplish anything except perhaps listening to lectures or podcasts (and who wants to do that after a full day of school and probably studying between classes) seems daunting. Would I have the time and/or discipline to spend all that time at school, work, driving, and still seek internships, participate in clubs/study groups, etc? Probably not.

The obvious, and really only, pro to not staying on campus is the money I'll save. Based on the tentative, college-provided calculations, I'm looking at ~17,000 per year to stay on campus for tuition, fees, and room and board. That's factoring in the ""in-state student in need"" discount, and not including the estimated $7,500 in Stafford loans. The gas, car depreciation, and parking fees if I were to commute would probably be in the ballpark of ~2,500 per year, so I'll consider it ~14,500 a year to stay on campus, vs the ~12,000 in tuition if I got no discounts (which I would need to take a loan out for at least two semesters anyways). I'll also be looking into scholarships this week after I've completed the application process.

I guess it boils down to my thought process being that the participation in my major outside of class, and the social experience are worth more than the ~2,500+ (I also probably won't work as much as 25 hours a week like I am now, so that adds significantly to the net loss) extra money I'll pay per year. Are there other factors, monetary or otherwise that I'm not considering? I'm fine sharing a room. I've shared a room with my brother (who I don't get along with at all) forever. I don't get along with most of my family (5 siblings) and I get along just fine in my house. So the factors of sharing a room (potentially with someone I don't particularly like) sharing facilities, etc is nothing new to me.

I've rambled long enough. I just want to think this through thoroughly before I commit to something that might not benefit me. If you have any extra insight, please let me know.

With that out of the way, I am 21 years old and will be a super senior in college next year. I live in Chicago and pay a modest rent of $470/month. I took a year off school to work and become a resident so I could transfer from Columbia to UIC and get in state tuition.

Anyway:
1) treat college as a job recruiting ground--every department connection (do you have an adjunt that might have a sweet internship/volunteering recommendation)?, every friend in your major. It really is who you can turn to down the line and say, I need a job.

2) The horrible thing is literally every entry level job these days seems to expect college students to learn all the skills one might need for a mid level job - excel for data entry or accounting; a certain amount of bookeeping; salesforce or similar database programs. Possible even MS Access. Adobe Photoshop and some html/web design. It's all versatile. 

I was stupid; my sociology degree in gender/welfare makes me far, far less valuable than the person with a digital marketing degree who will not only make more money than me, but is more valuable to not-for-profits where we're competing for, say, administrative jobs. 

There are some common things--stuff you'll learn writing for your papers, but....know more than that. If you can learn Quickbooks (big plus in entry level office jobs in any major company) for basic accounting, do it. If you can learn Adobe Creative Suite for a school paper, do it. If you can write for ANYONE, in any recreational respect--group blog, online school newspaper, personal tumblr of reviews, TED Talks--do so.

I am applying for receptionist jobs now but the major employers hiring want creative types with experience and they want references. 

Go on Craigslist and really take a look at the internships and the software asked for the skills....now.

3) Don't put off going to your career services office.
I'm very lucky, that's one thing my school got right.

It takes four years to build up basic computer skills, poise to get through an interview, write a good resume tailored to a specific job, get used to the grind of writing cover letters, and develop transferable skills that will get you in the day to data entry/analysis, event planning, coordinating with clients...all of which can be tailored across different fields into jobs to keep a roof over your head.

I wish someone had taken me by the hand and warned me a decade ago, but I was forced into graduate school for a field I had zero interest in that was highly specialized and horrifically underpaid.

I would not go to grad school unless you MUST--I'm sure those of you in the medical or engineering fields have to. It's a huge waste of money and physical energy. Be very careful about the program you choose and their requirements to graduate (the fieldwork, the reviews of professors, the number of credits assigned to ""x"" number of work). I've seen it all. Try to get as high a gpa as you can now based on the same criteria and if you can't get into a graduate school with good accrediation and a strong career placement for you field...RUN. Really, just fucking run in the other direction. Look into another route. Get your GPA up some other way.

See college as the first step feeding up the ladder into employment.

The sad thing is it's wonderful and you're learning how to write and think as a community but employers give fuckall about giving you that experience in the future until you can demonstrate basic, technical use to them, generating content (again--even for a basic receptionists or data entry job for an industry that specifies they only need a receptionist, but interviewed as if they would only hire someone with 5 years experience performing the same content creation tasks they did) or demonstrating office/marketing experience (and multiple fields, including not-for-profits, want people that do that or have skills in that. Hell, receptionists are now expected to ""market"" their organizations). 

You need to have all these skills for jobs that might pay $13/hour.
Get it now, even if it's unfair you should be obligated to treat this time as job training time too.

They're core and some are ones for a major I'm interested in (writing) but even when I'm taking a class about writing, something I love, I can't bring myself to care. It just drags and tries to be interesting, but I'm not happy and feel like I'm wasting my time. Even those one or two classes I somewhat like seem like a sham to me, like a scam to get my money. (Ex.

Things to do with my hands makes me excited and I love seeing the final product just as much as the process to get there, but once I told my parents my interest in technical things, they weren't happy. They tried to convince me ""oh, so you want to do computer work,"" but that sounds terrible to me. I'm just not interested in that.

701,friend0rags,1479962227,/r/college/comments/5elweo/unsatisfied_illequipped_for_this_world/,"Background:

After returning to California after 4 years in the Army I looked forward to pursuing a higher education at the University of California, San Diego(UCSD) with my newly awarded GI Bill. Hoping to declare Aerospace Engineering I soon found that the program was impacted and therefore highly impacted. Nevertheless, I chose another interest of mine Astrophysics; however, without any experience with physics and jaded by the implications of ""weed-out"" courses I changed my major to Mathematics in hopes of becoming a high school teacher. 

Unfortunately I was imprisoned over the summer due to my alcoholism and a well-placed checkpoint. Afterwards my grades continued to drop to the point of my academic disqualification, and the forcing of a change of major to Literature. What followed was my mother's relapse into meth, her hospitalization, and my depression. 

Nowadays, in the mist of the readmission process, I navigate the community college realm; requirements being a full year as a full-time student with a B average. At the beginning of the semester I was working overnight, tossing boxes down aisles at Target, the only place that would hire me, from 11pm-7am; sometimes going 24-72 hours without sleep. Ever since my academic disqualification I took a pay cut, going from $2900 to $1400 a month. As for my health, I was without my medication and therapy, lacked sleep from the duality between working days and nights, and lost 20 pounds due to my stress and inability to afford food. 

Liberating myself from the overnight stressor I'm now pursuing, unsuccessfully, any job that compliments a college schedule. Having learnt the clockwork like job at Target after a week, I saw that there was little room for advancement, and no hope of professional development. Does one toil perpetually in order to pay their bills or pursue a college education in hopes of a better career? Quitting my job without any savings has left me in the grips of my debtors. 

This has been a big rant and reflection so I must conclude with the realization of my lower class state and rising resiliency to a college education. One feels stuck in this lower tier of labor; working a minimum wage job with no future, unable to find affordable housing, and pay for tuition and textbooks. 

I really want to give up....i don't know who I really am....I'm not really good at anything since every hackneyed, compulsive endeavor has failed. I have an idea of what I want to do, but UCSD has barred me from Engineering and Mathematics. Having completed most of my general education, 89 quarter units(equal to 60 semester units), I am left with no applicable knowledge and no certification. These past 3 years I have been blowing like chafe in the wind, landing where ever the breeze takes it, be it the harvester's bucket or, in my case amongst the weeds and thorns. Ultimately I'm without direction and without cause, this tragic life keeps spiraling evermore into the abyss as I try to escape its grasp. Please....I need direction....I need a job....I feel like if I continue with the readmission process as a Literature major, I'll never get a job. It's not like I'm capable of moving to another city or state to start anew.....I just don't know what to do anymore...I find myself constantly procrastinating and distracting myself in a self saboteur manner....my grades are going great at the CC, but truthfully, the courses are a joke since one doesn't have to actually read any of the assignments in order to pass.....is college really worth it if I can't apply in this modern world? Buying into the advanced education dogma of the promise to the American Dream has left me unskilled and unsatisfied.

So to get my masters degree I went to a larger school, and had a larger tuition. I completely assumed that FAFSA would still take care of the tuition in full, as long as I still planned to pay it once I was done with school.

Fast forward to this week, I'm doing decent enough in school to pass and everything is going well until I get a email saying my student account is on hold because I still owe money for tuition and can't apply for next semesters classes. Went to bursars office to find out I still owe about $13,000. Well shit, this was unexpected I was under the impression everything was fine. Today I went to the financial aide counselor and they told me that FAFSA doesn't cover the full tuition and my only options are a parent plus loan, or a direct loan from a bank. Fuck me right? Talked to my Dad about the situation and we're going to look into ways to deal with it.

The big thing is I feel bad about making my parents pay off my tuition with a parent plus loan if that's what it comes to. I wouldn't have come back to school if I'd have known that the loan system wouldn't fully cover it because my parents aren't in the best position to just take up a loan like that on my behalf. On top of that now I'm already nearly through a semester and I'm sure I wouldn't be able to get any sort of refund. So I am now boned because continuing on this path would mean my parents would have to take up most of the loans on my behalf, and ultimately I wouldn't be able to finish college because I'm most likely going to have to call it quits after this semester if student loans won't cover my tuition.

So if anyone has been in a situation similar to this, or knows of any ways to get extra loan help it would be much appreciated. Any advice would be great, and i appreciate it in advance. Like I said in the title I'm ignorant to the way loans work apparently, so even a lesson on those would be helpful.

TL;DR: FAFSA doesn't cover my entire tuition, but I didn't know this. Fast forward to now and I owe 13 grand but have no way to pay it off except to get my parents to do it. I'd rather drop out and pay for it myself then put my parents in more debt then they are already.

Im not paying for bills or textbooks right now, so Im just saving as much as I can, but I keep dropping 100's on random items(usually clothes). That makes me want to stay back for another semester even more, just not sure if its worth missing out on another semester at a uni. Plus its summer after the semester, where I won't have many friends to chill with and wait even longer. Don't get me wrong, I love this pt job, honestly best one Ive ever had. They pay good and their really nice to me, often letting me do what I want. But I feel lonely at times when working, almost like Im not experiencing ""life"" or connecting with anyone else. Its just so repetitive at times, to where I can't believe Im stocking shelves repeatedly, while my friends are at college having fun with the social aspect. Also my family just got a puppy last year, so I feel like spending a little more time with him might be best. 

Sorry for the venting but Im pretty confused right now, I feel like money isn't worth missing any opportunities to enjoy my youth in college. What do you guys think?

It took me a while to realize why I was going to college so my GPA suffered somewhat at first; but I ended up graduating with 3.0 after I actually developed a passion for what I was learning about. Upon graduation, I got a decent paying job which required me to move out of state. I'm starting to realize that maybe this job isn't want I want to do long term (doesn't have as much to do with my field as I'd hoped.) So I've began to evaluate my options. Some reason I keep bringing myself back to graduate school. I really do enjoy learning. I find myself always studying and investigating even though I'm not in university anymore. I want to get involved in research into this field and I want to become an ""expert"". That being said, I don't know if I can venture away from my professional career to enroll into graduate school for several reasons. Mainly being traced back to financial reasons (student loan increases and an almost certain significant cut in pay.)

Now for the question, how can I know if Grad School is right for me? I've tossed around this idea for a while now, so I figure it's time to either get serious about it or put it to bed for now...

I am a high school junior right now, and I have a strong desire to take some college courses at local colleges to advance my learning, in math and physics to be specific. My local community college didn't offer any classes I needed in those areas, so I looked to the state colleges nearby. After lots of discussing, it was determined that for me to take classes at the college, I would apply as a non-degree seeking student and take the classes that way. However, after ironing out the details, I discovered that I wouldn't be able to apply any of my merit for scholarships at the college, nor apply for FAFSA or any sort of student loans or federal aid in that manner. If I am using their calculator properly (about ~$350 per credit hour, most classes are 3 credit hours), then I am looking at around $1,000 per semester class. 

I don't come from a family with the kind of money to pay for anything more than one semester of a class, much less two semesters or even other classes. Not to mention we are dealing with some medical payments that simply make it impossible to put down that kind of money. 

I don't know what options are out there for me to pay for this. I am looking at all outlets I know, but by being a junior I'm ineligible for many of them. If there are options based on merit I don't know, I would very likely be eligible, but I simply cannot find any. I can't be sure this is the right place, but if anyone knows of options or outlets I should look into, I would be eternally grateful. 

If there isn't an option out there, there isn't an option, and I'll have to accept that, I suppose. But this would be a huge deal and classes at this college would be greatly beneficial, and I will go to as many lengths as I can to take these classes.

Not stellar, but with the classes I had, I was happy with it. My fall semester of my sophomore year, I was working full-time and overslept a lot of my classes (didn't get off work until 1:30 a.m. most days). Oversleeping classes and not having time to study led me to struggle in my classes. I should have either cut back hours at work, or dropped my classes so I could get more money to pay for school. Consequently, I failed every class because I was too proud to ""quit"". 

I took the following semester off to work and think about life. I saved up enough money that I wouldn't have to work as much when I returned, and I felt pretty confident that if I get a degree, I will be a high school physics teacher. Also, I plan on retaking the classes I failed because my school ""replaces"" your G.P.A. if you retake a class, but the F's will still be on my transcript. I am not worried about the F's because if I do well in the classes the 2nd time and explain to future employers what happened; the F's should not be the end of the world.

Fast forward to present day, I'm retaking my classes and over 1/2 through the semester. I feel confident in 3 of my 4 classes, but the last class is the worrisome part. I do not think I will pass my Multivariable Calculus course. My school has a policy that if you fail a class twice, you can not retake it. However, being a physics major, Multivariable Calc is an essential class to my major.

Also, I dropped Linear Algebra and Differential Equations (essential class) my freshman year, because I was not going to pass. I have yet to retake that class.

So, here is where I need advice:

1. Do I drop Calc and retake it next semester to try passing it? If I do this, it will be my third time taking the class. If I have to take a class 3 times just to pass it, and I'm not stellar in my other classes, I fear future classes will give me more trouble. I can't justify continuing paying ridiculous amounts of money if I'm just going to retake classes and/or not succeed.

2. Drop Calc, finish my semester in other classes, take my next semester classes, and then take retake Calc at a CC over the summer to get the credits?

3. Or is this a wake up call that maybe my major is too difficult for me? If that is the case, I don't think I should be in college because I truly don't want to study anything else. If I do any profession besides high school teaching, it will be a profession that doesn't require a degree.

4. Just work and live life for awhile. Pursue hobbies, volunteer, try to start a career without a degree. Worst case scenario, I go back to school down the line? I'm financially stable and the money I make when full-time is more than enough for a single person my age to thrive.

or 5. Any advice you guys can think of.

TL;Dr: I might fail an essential class to my major twice. This will make me un-elligable to graduate with said major. I'm extremely struggling in other classes. I'm un-willing to study anything other than my major. Advice?

I'm currently enrolled part-time in my first semester in a community college for CISS, but I don't have the math requirements so I'm in individual studies until I can.

I did start out full time with 14 credits my class list was CISS100, CISS110, PHYS105 and HIST137 but, due to my current living situation with not having my own vehicle and living 45 minutes away from campus, I can't commute so all my courses are online..

I feel like this is where I fucked up... I thought online courses weren't going to be bad, but I feel like this is just setting me up for failure.. not allowing me to show my pure potential.

I ended up taking a ""W"" for CISS110 (which I shouldn't have been in, but my advisor put me in anyways) and a ""W"" HIST137 because it was way too hard.

Now I'm doing semi-okay in CISS100 and I'm passing, but I'm doing terrible in PHYS105 (which is Introduction to Astronomy) I have an F... I understand nothing about this class at all, nothing on the discussion boards makes sense to me.. and nothing on labs makes sense to me..

I'm only taking 7 credits now, minimum I can take is 6, so I can't drop anything.. I'm looking to transfer to a different SUNY school where I can go live on campus, but I feel like this semester is going to COMPLETELY fuck up my chances of getting into this other SUNY school.

And, if I don't get into this other college and fail either of my 2 classes come December... I can't get Financial aid the next semester because school policy is to be in ""good academic standing"" 

I'm not dumb when it comes to school.. I just feel like this online is taking away my true potential I can commit, it's so much different than being in an actual classroom setting.. I wish I knew that before I enrolled..

709,caketastydelish,1476437194,/r/college/comments/57figq/question_for_librarians_or_people_that_are/,"I am a Computer Information Systems major with a double minor in English and Accounting

Alright first a little about me... I have a mental illness called Schizoaffective disorder and a tl;dr version of that illness means my mind is fragile and can't handle stress well, roughly 80% of people with my illness are unemployed and the majority of those that do work only work part time, and work minimum waggish jobs.

So ""this other major would pay more"" is not necessarily relevant, if the work that comes with it is beyond my mental stamina.  A job I can actually survive with is more important than something that could theoretically pay more, but is very stressful and I will hate every minute of it.

I have always been ""the guy"" among my friends and family with computer problems.  I have a passion for the IT field.  I wouldn't go as far to say I hate coding (you actually do learn to code with a CIS degree, just not as much as CS).  I just get more satisfaction helping people in a direct way than a job where I'm stuck in a cubicle only coding.  I have an INFJ personality type and get a huge satisfaction when I help people with their problems.  While you are technically helping people with problems when you code, it feels much more abstract than going up to someone, physically meeting them, and help them get their computer/network to work.

 With that being said, if I absolutely can't get a job without more coding, I can learn it on my own.  I say this because (I've heard) you don't need a CS degree to get a programming job anyway.  A friend of mine also tells me there are coding ""boot camps"", which I would attend if push comes to shove.  That said I'm saving it for a last resort option, because I imagine a coding job as very stressful, and I personally doubt I would have the mental capacity to handle it.

Based on what I hear, Accounting is a good compliment to a CIS degree.  I'm also naturally good with numbers, making it all the more favorable.  Beyond that, people with my condition are known to be exceptionally bad at managing their money.  If nothing else, the accounting classes could help me with my own independence skills.

Finally the English:  Based on what I hear lots of STEM majors are bad with essays/grammar/critical thinking, so having a background in English as well could be icing on the cake.  I have my own blog (which I won't advertise here due to the rules of this subreddit) but most people who look at it consider me to be a decent writer.

Here are the different options I see for myself after graduating:

1) work at a PC help desk.  Even if it pays not much more than minimum wage, it would be a job I'd be easily qualified for, and thus could easily handle.  Remember: the vast majority of people with my condition either work part time, or don't work at all.  Thus, I'm already beating the odds.

2) the same as 1) but work my way up to network engineer/database administrator/whatever, and after that maybe even quit working for someone else, and freelance as a network consultant.  And with the background in accounting, there's a good chance I'd actually survive with my own business.  It's also worth noting that people with my condition have highs and lows, in terms of energy.  If I freelance that means I get to make my own schedule, which would be hugely beneficial.

3) Work in a library.  In order to become a head librarian I would eventually have to get a Masters in Library Science.  The good news, though, is that this is a job (I think) I can easily handle.  I was a library assistant at my school for 2 years (once when I was 14 and once when I was 18).  I've also volunteered at libraries several other times throughout my adult life.  

The other good news (and please correct me if I'm wrong about this) is that someone with an undergraduate degree in CIS with a dual minor in English and Accounting would be wonderful for a library.  Most people wanting to be librarians, major/minor purely in the liberal arts.  While that might have been good 50 years ago, the library of today is quite a bit different.

4) Become a CPA.  I've already taken a lot of college hours (I used to be an English major but switched out of that when I realized I was wasting my time).  You need 150 college hours to sit for the CPA exam, which I would have by the time I graduate.  Becoming a CPA would pretty much be a last resort option, but it is at least technically out there.  There's only 18 hours worth of Accounting classes in my minor, which is obviously not enough knowledge for the CPA exam.  It would require additional college, but again, this is there as a backup plan.

I would like to think I have this all thought-out pretty well... but obviously I don't know as much as people who have worked in these fields.",college,Question for librarians or people that are familiar with libraries.

My teacher has a really, really heavy accent. So heavy that I struggle to understand anything he says. The first ten minutes of class I try an focus as hard as I can, but inevitably I lose focus. I've tried everything to stay focused. Left my laptop and phone at home, sat in the front of class, gone to office hours etc. I just can't do it. He also uses a syllabus that was made in the 90's with no exact dates for papers and tests. If you ask about papers and tests in class he laughs and says ""we'll talk about it later"". He assigns chapters each day in class, forgets what he assigned, and asks us the next class what the readings were. In office hours when I ask about the reading he just says ""what were they?"". It's my only class on Monday and Wednesday, and in all honesty it feels like a waste of time to go. I attend a commuter school. It's 1.5 hours to get to this class and 1.5 to get home. My entire day is shot because of this and it's really frustrating to go out to school just to sit mindlessly for two hours. My motivation to attend is shrinking and I need suggestions on how to make this easier on myself. I'm a 4.0 student currently and have never had real issues with motivation or attending a class, until now.

The main issues are;
1.) I'm graduating this semester and need this class. Dropping is not an option.
2.) I attend a commuter school, 1.5 hours to get there, 1.5 to get home. Day feels wasted.
3.) Unsure of dates, readings and deadlines even with office hours.

TL;DR: My professors accent is too heavy to understand. It's a 3 hour total commute for one class. Don't know what work is required of us or when it's due, even if I go to office hours. Need advice.


Edit: here's a link to his syllabus. The dates on it are in June for the fall semester. And the weeks things are ""due"" don't line up. (One of them is Fall recess)

Edit 2: Update - today's class, he walked into the class. Started a movie, left and never came back leaving the entire class bewildered. We are going as a group to report him to the dean. This is unacceptable.

Now, before you answer right away, I'd like to take a moment and explain my situation:

I'm a fairly well off student, with a 4.1 GPA Weighted, and 3.8 Unweighted. My ACT's 31 (I jumped 3 points from 28 to 31 between the last test and this one so I am expecting to do somewhat better the next time I take it this month). I took the SAT subject tests, still waiting to get my scores back. I have a pretty good transcript, and this is the basic rundown:
-Freshman year: No weighted classes, just the prereqs to prep me for the classes the rest of high school
-Sophomore year: Starting out slow with just AP chem and AP Human Geo, with the rest unweighted
-Junior year: Ramped it up this year with the IB program, with my only non-weighted class being Java programming (1 semester), which brings junior year to a grand total of 15.5 semesters worth of weighted classes. Only AP class was AP Macro (1 semester)
-Senior year: Ramped up even more, with those IB classes going into their HL II phase. I have a lot of B's because I'm reaching the limit of my ability, and I'm just scraping to survive at this point. Decided to take an extra SL and extra HL just for the lolz and now I'm choking on it.

Now that you have a basic rundown of how it is in school, I'd like to explain my concern with college itself:

My parents work for a university in town, and it's not the best university in the world, but they offer tuition remission, and if I went there, I calculated that my cost to go there would be $10k before scholarships kick in. I've looked into another college in town, and my counselor informed me of a similar rate because of my ACT score (a 32 would get me full ride).

Now, these aren't the greatest colleges. And I don't know if they're the fit for me yet. Mind you, my mindset is still that of  college being a prize to be won, not a match to be made, so I might be missing a step in my reasoning. 

So, as I expand my exploration of colleges, I'm eyeing Ivy league schools (idk if I would even get in, but let's assume in a hypothetical that I am a reasonable candidate and they do invite me to join their school). Now, these colleges probably don't offer the same financial advantages that a smaller school would offer its students, nor would it offer something like tuition remission. On top of that, I would have to pay room and board, inflating my costs by at minimum, $10k, the cost of an entire 4 years at the university my parents work at. *and that's just a fraction of what I would pay*. But say I get some hefty financial incentives, say somehow I knock off a majority of it through scholarships, grants, financial aid, etc (I assume 20k/yr would be reasonable? maybe? remotely?). 

Is it worth forgoing the **guaranteed** free/next to nothing education at a small university, to shoot for a possibility of going to a larger institution for a bigger post-graduate income at the cost of paying more for an education? This is assuming I do get in, and assuming that said hypothetical scholarships can fund me at the $20k/yr (correct me if my estimate is wrong).

I have looked at college ROIs ( http://www.payscale.com/college-roi ) and done calculations based on them, and the math says that bigger, out of state colleges are better. But financial incentives, along with room and board savings, as well as proximity to my parents, says smaller colleges are better. I can't tell if the opportunity cost of choosing a small college matches the incentives I gain by making that choice. At the same time I cannot justify the opportunity cost of choosing a large college to the **possible** favor I receive when I get a job (Do employers really say ""hey this kid graduated from Harvard, let's hire him and not the kid from Hawaii State University""? (I'm sorry if I offended anyone, it was an arbitrary example using my favorite state))

My parents' stance on this is that they want me to go to a small university, so that they can keep an eye on me and out of learning bad habits (might seem funny, but it's a very serious issue when it comes to my parents)

Thank you in advance for your advice, and I hope to hear from someone (or a lot of people) soon!

TL;DR - I don't know wether to go to a big university or a small one. Small ones give me money, but big ones give me cred. Parents want me to go to a small university. I'm saying that I want to go to a big one if it outweighs the benefits of going to a small one. Please give me advice on what to do.

My school has a very strict absence policy where the professor is allowed to drop you if you miss more than two classes. This is due to the fact that the class meets for 8 hours, once a week, and if you miss two, you've essentially missed 16 hours of class a lot of critique experience as that is what the course is based on (it's an art school).

So what happened was that I missed two days and two hours of class. All of it was excused medical absence, except for the last two hours which were due to a hearing and also being very ill and unable to make it through the last hour of class.

He dropped me from the class the day before the final. I wasn't even given an incomplete, everything was voided, I am not being given a chance to make up the work or the time, I will not be receiving the credits, and I will have to pay for the course again.

This really sucks because I am now in my major (the first year at this college is a ""foundation program"" where everyone takes the same classes), and I simply do not have the time to take this class. It will absolutely not fit into my schedule during the year, and I can't do it during the summer because I'll be working or taking internships.

Academics wise I have been doing very well. I took two courses this summer as well and did fantastically.

This is all because I figured out what was wrong with me medically. I have celiac disease. For those of you who are not familiar with this condition, it is when your body creates an autoimmune response to gluten and in turn these antibodies attack your intestinal lining. This destroys the little hair/finger like tissue in your small intestine which help you digest food and absorb nutrients. This doesn't just cause a stomach ache, it affects every facet of your life. Not only does it come with gas, diarrhea, nausea, etc, it also causes depression, anxiety, fatigue, ""brain fog"", skin rashes, and a host of other problems unrelated to the GI tract. It also puts you at a 75% increased risk for cancer. This is because your body is not receiving the right nutrients and can't function properly as a result. I was brutally sick for the majority of last year. Fortunately, I am no longer eating gluten and I feel fantastic and I am doing very well. 

People with celiac disease are protected under the Americans with Disabilities act.

Now that I know what was wrong with me, do I have any ammunition to continue to fight this decision? I am still determined to find a solution or alternative, I feel that what my professor did was incredibly unjust.",college,My professor dropped me a day before the final due to what I now know is a disability.

I have been dragging my ass through school barely making any progress because I have to work so much in order to pay my bills. It puts me in a dilemma where I can't fully dedicate myself to school because I'm so busy with work and I can't fully dedicate myself to a job because I would need to go to school in order to find a job worth dedicating myself to (again I know this struggle is not unique).

I actually love school and it is seriously my dream to just go full force and get a degree, but I don't think I'm ever really going to be able to do that while working. So, more specifically, my question is have any of you actually gotten through school, living on your own and paying your own bills, without working? Is it possible to get enough scholarship money to actually live comfortably on your own? 

This may sound stupid, I just know almost nothing about scholarships and would really appreciate hearing about some firsthand experiences.

A few things to note about my situation are that I get almost the full pelt grant every semester and have the help of my grandma solely for tuition and school fees, so as far as paying for school itself I'm totally covered. But where living expenses are concerned, I pay for everything myself and living with family or getting money from them is just really not an option. I've been living extremely comfortably and putting money in savings off of about $2000 a month, which I know is probably not at all the type of funds I could expect from scholarships, but I am hoping to get somewhere close. I would just work very part time on top of school if I had to as well.

720,Hanyeseul2,1473353666,/r/college/comments/51sae7/problems_with_major_and_parents/,"Lately I've been at odds with my parents about my college plans. For the past couple of years, I have struggled as a science major but I pushed through partly my parents would only let me be a science major, so I didn't think I had any options. I also thought science was for me since I was always told that I was above average in intelligence, I was steered towards the medical field from a young age, and some aspects of science like neurobiology interested me, or so I thought they did. Starting last year with organic chemistry, I was struggling to keep up in class. The lecture was so boring. The teacher would just drone on and on and I couldn't even understand the material. I even failed the first test in my first semester. My parents really encouraged me to push through and luckily I passed the second semester with a really high grade but in the meantime I discovered something. Then I discovered something. I realized that most of the material in my classes did not interest me. Heck the material that did interest me most of the time wasn't even related to my major. For example, I thought classes like philosophy where I could be more creative and make my own ideas were more interesting and were of more value than organic chemistry. Of course I also liked these classes because of the teachers. The One science class that I was passionate about the most was microbiology and that was because of the teacher, not really the material. The next class that I took was biochemistry. The lectures were 2 fucking hours each with only a 10 minute break. I found out soon that I couldn't survive or pay attention. It was fucking boring and I couldn't pay attention. I wasn't passionate about the subject.

 I had another realization that I am not a passive learner. I'm an active learner and I need to be doing something besides taking notes blindly and listening for hours. I figured out that I was more interested and paid more attention when I did stuff like graphic design where I could get in touch with my artistic side and have more control over what I do. Most of the classes in this major are lecture based and there's no room for independent thought. That is when I realized this major wasn't for me and I stopped going to class, much to my parents dismay. I told them this class doesn't suit my learning style and that I learn better by myself. Classes like this were an obstacle for me, not really helpful. My parents made me finish this class and I listened to them because I was under the assumption that I would be able to change my major. I was willing to compromise. Unfortunately stuff fell through and right before I started school, my dad sat down with me and understood that even though I want to go to a different major, I still had to finish this one. I was really upset because I told them how I struggled and it was only giving me more depression and anxiety.

 I fought with both my mom and dad all summer. My mom didn't want me to drop out because of the debt it would incur. I felt like my dad wasn't listening. They eventually gave me an ultimatum that I have to either stay in this major or move out. The latter is impossible now so I had no choice. It was so bad that I stayed in the rain for like 30 minutes just so I wouldn't have to go back to school. I'm back in school now and I still can't do my work. No matter what anyone says my brain can't process all this information and it's not wired for this shit, especially because I'm not really interested in any of this stuff. I told my parents this and my mom keeps blaming anxiety. I doubt it's anxiety because even when I'm watching my favorite tv shows I can only get so much work done of none at all. It has to do with attention issues and interest, and they are both connected. My mom suggested I take anxiety medication but I don't think that will solve the problem. It's an inner problem of motivation. Medication would only make me more tired. I don't think this profession is for me since I'm not really interested in most of the stuff I'm learning and I don't get that same feeling of passion that I get when I do things I actually enjoy. I remember I spent a whole day making digital art and it was time consuming but I really wanted to make the effort. In my major, I just feel like a slave and I'm not really doing this wholeheartedly.

It worked out when I first moved in around this time last year, but her attitude changed drastically after her boyfriend left her. She became emotionally abusive to the point where I sometimes cried at the thought of having to go back home to her after class. I even spend as much time as possible on campus or stuck in my room just so I don't have to see her or speak to her.

This semester, I enrolled in another school for classes as well as the one I've been doing until now. The new college offers some courses I can't take in my current college, and I was excited about taking them.

The problem is, I just found out that I can only be enrolled full time in one college. So the college I've been in the last two years is my full-time college, and this new one is my part time college.

A few months ago, I asked TAP whether I can send TAP aid to a second college I'm enrolled in, and they said yes. So to pay for both, I planned on sending TAP to my full time college, and FAFSA to my part-time college.

Today, I called them (for another reason), and the person on the phone told me that TAP and FAFSA must be sent to the same school. I called again two hours later, and the woman on the phone this time told me that as long as TAP is being sent to a school I'm a full-time student of, there should be no issue sending TAP to a college different than my FAFSA.

Right now, I'm tied down to this situation, and if I withdraw from this second (part time) college I'll be left without a dorm and will have to rent out an apartment - in my area, it's almost as expensive as the classes I'm taking (where I also get a dorm for very little cost).

Are there any issues sending Pell grants (FAFSA) to a part time college, and TAP to another? I understand I put myself in a really bad situation, and I really really wish I could change things, but there's not much I can do right now.

727,dubidubidoorafa,1472268619,/r/college/comments/4zshhd/am_i_crazy_for_trying_this/,"So my ideal job is to become a PA. I don't really want to become a doctor, even though my parents want me too, because of the difficulty and massive debt. I'm a junior transfer to a big university and my major is Biomed, so I have two years left to complete my major. After that, PA school last for 2-3 years. And PA school is very, very competitive.

But to get into PA school, you need direct patient care hours. You basically need to be directly involved with patient care. Some people take a ""gap year"" in which they strengthen their application. I have a phlebotomist certificate I got from a trade school during my first 2 years at community, that I planned to use to work part-time to get me some money. I thought that would qualify but I learned most PA schools, look at CNAs, MAs, and EMTs. Most of these jobs are entry level jobs in health care and don't really pay that well.

So my problem is time and money (as with most things in life). You can't really get a job with just a Biomed degree and my phlebotomist certificate doesn't pay well. I also need patient care hours that qualify. My worry is also that PA school is very competitive and money consuming. I also have a low GPA already, 3.1, compared to most PA students. So I kinda want a fall-back If I lose interest or can't get in. Becoming a CNA, MA, or EMT also feels redundant because it's low paying and I have to go to trade school again, along with completing my major. There's other majors that you could use to get into PA school but my dad insisted on Biomed, in ever the case I wanted to go become a doctor.

So my solution is to complete my Biomed degree full time in the university (12 credits minimum) while enrolling myself in a trade school nursing program, like the ones you hear about in ads on Pandora, to become an RN. This would mean forgoing the opportunity to work part-time with my certificate. Full on studying. ALL DAY. For 2 years. Then I'd take the gap year to work full time as a nurse, get shadowing, volunteering, and the hours necessary for PA school. THEN 2 more years of school then my dream job is achieved. 

By doing this, I get a backup job that pays well, if I ever lose interest in schooling, get my hours, and get into PA school. Also a way to become BSN, if I end up hating PA. This will also help with any debt I may have with schooling. Am I being paranoid or is this a good plan? Is all this really necessary? Should I just take those EMT/CNA programs? There is a lot of time investment in this. Money's also a concern but I'll probably take loans and get even If I become a nurse/PA. There's also the stigma of being a male nurse.

I live with my parents, and commute via a ~20 minute drive. This is largely because my dad decided that I got a scholarship covering my tuition I should stay at home so that it's basically free. He won't pay for anything, and won't really let me pay for it either. I had my doubts about this arrangement but somehow convinced myself this would be okay. 

It is not okay. I can't help but feel like I'm just a high schooler who takes classes in college. All of my old friends live in dorms and have their own lives and social circles now, social circles I can't really access because I have to go home at the end of the day and meet my fucking curfew. I'm a stranger in their dorms. I'm a stranger at what is supposed to be my home, my university. 

I don't know anybody else because I don't have any dorm mates and my life is basically going from class to class until I can go home. My own point of access is clubs and that's problematic because I go home at like 3 and then have to drive back to school at like 9 at night and the and then drive back again. 

I tried to explain that college and my social life exist in the gaps of the times when I'm there, that people are forming relationships almost exclusively while I'm not there, but he say's it's just in my head. This is coming from the same person who like 2 years ago said that living in a dorm was one of the most crucial and transformative periods in his life and he think's that everyone should do it.

Everytime we talked about it I threw it off.  Before I knew it I was about to graduate and was literally asked by my father what I wanted to go to school for.  I had no idea to be honest, and he said if you HAD to choose something right now what would it be? I just blurted out Accounting literally because I couldn't think of anything else and I still can't. (I took 2 years of very basic accounting courses in high school and found it okay).  I didn't want to be in college because of time, effort, and money.  I just started my first semester at a community college and I feel overwhelmed already. I feel like the only reason I am sitting in class is for my parents to be happy and I happen to get a scholarship to where I only have to pay for the books and not any tuition.  
 
I currently work at a restaurant making $8 an hour and I just wanted to keep working and work more / different places etc etc, whatever I could with no college in the picture.  My parents said there would be little chances of me to find a good life without college. (financially) Which i disagree with by the way because I have asked my parents for very little and live on the very least.  They expect me to have a big house, nice car, 3 children..I don't want that.  I used to get around 30 hours a week, but my parents told me to cut hours for schooling, which i obeyed so probably going to go to about 20.

I don't know I've been thinking about it alot since i started...I think I just posted this to tell someone...Maybe I am worried so much for nothing..

That's almost $2000, it's a big hit but my parents would not hesitate to pay for it if it was useful. $91 per hour is still worlds cheaper than $300/hour at the state college or $1000 at an Ivy League.

I don't have an older sibling like many of my friends do and confused with the college admission process and what steps I can take to further advance my education. My parents only have a high school degree and they can't help me. 

If I don't take these courses now, will they be required in college? For example, I don't think I will be needing to take Spanish in college. And if I want to major in something like biochemistry at my state university, I don't need credits for American History. I don't even plan to go to my state college, I really want to go out of state and want to shoot for an Ivy League.

I know I could pay for community college perfectly and work and save up money for university and transfer, that's the smart thing to do I get that... But it's not what I want. 

I am going to school for theatre and would like to get a jump start in the program ASAP. I'm planning on taking some core classes at a community college in the summer so those will be cheaper. 
I already met and have fallen in love with my roommate, I want to join the improv club, and do shows, and have a great college experience because the past years of my life haven't been so good, nor were the years before that. I really want to improve myself and make something out of myself and change for the better. I'm not saying j can't accomplish goals at community college I just think I can't accomplish the goals I want at community college. I'm ready to go! 

My plan is to apply for scholarships for next year, actually fill out my fasfa on time, and work, and next year I won't be living on campus so that'll help so I'm pretty sure I'm going to be okay BUT if not... Assuming worst of worst... Assuming I have no money and I'm screwed...

So I am from an incredibly low income, single parent household and without financial aid, I can't pay for my tuition although it's only close to $8000. Due to some mistakes that IRS has made ( already took many measures to resolve the matter but confirmed it won't be solved in time ) I will have to pay out of my pocket to finish the last year of my college. 

Although the President and financial administrators have been kind enough to extend my due dates for payment to prevent my classes from being dropped, it's become more evident that I will not be receiving any aid/scholarships from school to contribute towards tuition without FAFSA going through. 

As a student that transferred from a community college into this university, I really do not want to transfer again - I've had incredible amount of personal growth during this one year and met some great mentors/friends. At the same time, I am considering the reality that I will have to take this semester off - and there is a part of me that wonders whether I should apply to other, more prestige colleges around the area to see if I can receive better scholarships/aid ( as the current university has not been very helpful in actually providing me with financial assistance.)

Crazy thing about that is I originally had a B in the class, a screw up with blackboard not uploading my final assignments made the bitch drop me to an F. She doesn't like me, so she ended up changing it to exactly a 69. You just need a c to pass. Sadly, this affected my summer courses. I was a half time student but because of the grade she gave me they dropped me from my enc1102 course which made me have only one class. 

Long story short, it fucked up my financial aid. They took my grants away and I ended up not being able to pay for summer term, now I owe 3200. I will probably owe more now because of the F in the last summer class (this was my own fault. I shut down after I received an email that they would cancel my registration I thought they were talking about both fall and my summer course. So I stopped going thinking well what's the point of trying when it won't count anyways?) 

I can't go back in the fall. I cried at first, due to frustration of receiving no help, trying and failing, and just everything seeming to go against me. I used to want to be a doctor, that dream was dying each day I had to go to a class. I hate school. But it's been beaten and internalized into us at a young age that if we don't go ... Then our future will be a pathetic struggle with terrible quality of life. 

My grandmother is currently telling me to get a loan from Sallie Mae or the bank, pay off the 3k and go back in the fall .... But I don't want to. I dont want another loan. I don't want to go back, or at least not right now. I don't even know what I want anymore. I was looking at other things to do while I'm out of school, I even thought of getting a real estate license.

I guess all in all, I'm asking for you opinions. What do you think about this situation or what I should do. Should I take that loan? Should I go back? I know being out of college they will start hassling me to pay back loans anyways.

Also I'm the first person in my family to go to college so its hard for me to get advice about it at home. 

I started college in Fall of 2014 at a University of California as undeclared. I knew I wanted to be an engineering major but because of a lot of overcrowding and other UC system issues, I wasn't able to enroll in pre-req classes (i.e. math, physics, and chem for engineering, pretty standard lower div science major classes). I thought about dropping out after my first year and attending a CC but was strongly advised against and that transferring would not be an issue. I finished my second year with a quarter each of Calc and Gen. Chem. (After spending countless numbers hours and brain power trying to crash classes, email professors, complain to departments etc. I did, however, finish my GEs) 

Now I've finally gotten accepted to the engineering school of my dreams. Problem: I can't afford to spend $50,000 a year in tuition for 4 years as I will basically be starting the program as a ""freshman""(yes I'll get a lot of financial aid, but I'm pretty sure I'd only be able to get 2 more years of government aid/FAFSA and my new university is private/out of state). So I deferred my enrollment (first for a quarter, can extend later) in the hopes of making up some credits at a local CC. The problem I've had with this is that I need 2 semesters or 3 quarters of each class and my 1 quarter will not prepare me for semester 2 of math/chem (found this out last summer when trying to enroll in Calc II). 

Next problem, all of my local community colleges (SF Bay Area) are semester system so I would have to repeat the only useful credits I've earned in math/physics and I *really* do not have the extra time/money to spend on repeating classes that I did well in because I need to keep a part time job on the side to pay for things like health insurance. The only quarter system CC is De Anza College which is 2.5 hours away from my house (San Francisco) by public transit and I don't have a car or a license. However, I could use my savings to get a used car and commute would be 45 mins. It would also only take me 2 quarters at De Anza. My mom, however doesn't want me driving to school every day and doesn't understand that this is the only option I have other than repeating coursework. 

I'm not really sure what to do. I guess my questions are is it worth repeating 2 semesters of coursework when I could be making more progress in 2 more quarters of classes? Is there a workaround with CCs for getting them to accept quarter credits? Are you only eligible for FAFSA aid for 4 years of undergrad?

Some of you may get a laugh out of this, but my dream/goal is to go to medical school.  I've been told many times to give it up, my degree is useless, and so forth.  And I do admit, an Anthropology degree is pretty difficult to get around.  To make it relevant, I focused more towards the Biological side of the discipline, working with biostatistics and genetics data.  I took courses in public health, medical anthropology, biological physics, things of that nature that are offered at my university.  Academic performance and competitiveness, is where I fail at and absolutely where I should have been more careful about.  I was under a very difficult circumstance, which of course, is what many students with poor academic performance would also say to justify their GPA.  I've reflected about this over and over again and take full blame for everything, I simply want to move on and learn from these mistakes find a way to fix it.  I tell you a little bit about my background and circumstances, not as an exhaustive list of excuses, but as a lesson that hopefully someone can help me out and evaluate the options I now have.

How I get to the U.S is a long story, and I will spare you the details.  I came here when I was relatively young, but took a while to adjust and learn all the new technology, the first time I used a computer was when I started my first day of class in the U.S, it was in 5th grade.  I was the first in my family to attend and graduate High school, and then college.  As you can imagine, everything was a ""learn-on-the-job"" type of situation.   Applying to college was a magical situation for me, everything was online, submit a few essays...and that's it.  Who submitted my documents, test results? How'd they know it's me? Everything was just done automatically, it was a little shocking to me.  But somehow, I managed it, I got in a decent state college (UF).  I was a little behind the curve with technology, but everything else, I managed.  But that's when everything just went sour.

Being away from home was, of course, a little difficult.  But I managed the first two semester fine.  My second year and forth is when everything just went bad.  I started overthinking about what I wanted to do, the end goal, that I over load on volunteering, extracurricular, silly resume booster things that are now meaningless because of my incompetent GPA.  My grade dropped, I became ineligible for the grants and aid I was receiving and ended up having to take a job to cover for these expenses.  I was literally illiterate when it comes to money and financial aid at that point.  My parents advised me against loans (it's a big no-no and highly stigmatized for them), and of course I listened.  I made absolutely no use of the resources available, had no idea where to look for help or even ask questions, I felt like completely lost and ashamed in front of my peers with my situation.  Looking back, I was a fool and hated myself for it.  I worked overnight shifts and weekends at the hospital, scheduled my classes early in the morning so i can go straight to class after work, getting paid 10/hr, you can imagine how it was to pay for 3-4k tuition a semester.  My schedule would often look like this: 10pm-8am (work) 8:30-noon (class).  It was exhausting, I studied on the job, on the bus, between classes, during lunch, on the toilet, literally anywhere, just to get by with a 2.4.  Pretty sad, I know.

I graduated and working now at a dead-end job that pays 9/hr, even worse than when I had no degree.  Doing everything I can, volunteering, researching, everything and anything to hope for a chance that some school would look pass my horrid GPA and a somewhat irrelevant degree.  My GPA is too low to even apply to any postbacc, masters, certificates.  Some have suggested that I do some DIY classes at a nearby school to raise my GPA, but that would require me to be a non-degree seeking student, which would rule out financial aid, I can't afford tuition with my job and even if i could, that would be making the same mistake all over again.

What should I do reddit?  I've consider cutting my losses, apply for a second degree and get a STEM major? I'm really at a dead-end this time around and it's becoming quite a burden/depressing thing to handle.  Reaching out for some words of wisdom and advice.  Thank you, reddit.

I've been wasting my life away up until recently and decided that I want to get my life back on track.

I've enrolled to a local community college about 8 or so miles away, and my parents would have to drive there to drop me off and drive back to pick me back up. So that's 32 miles every day I have class. I live in a very rural area (&lt;2,100 population) so it's not like there's a college I could walk to, this is the closest one and it doesn't have boarding.

The only income we have is my dad's SSDI (~$730ish/mo) and food stamps. We struggle to pay the bills as it is and there is no way that they could afford the gas to take me to college out of pocket. 

I've applied to almost every place I can in my area but since it's so rural there are rarely any openings. Since I haven't been to college or ever had a job, whenever there actually are job openings better qualified people are the ones getting them.

My friends tell me financial aid doesn't give me spending money until about a month after I've been in the college. If there was some way I could get it earlier then there would be no problem.

I don't know what to do. It looks like my only option is to just hope I land a job before the semester starts...

I started college as a nursing major and wanted to work as a nurse/midwife in a developing area. I barely made it through my first semester. My advisor was a prick who pretty much said ""prepare to be in community college for three years before being able to start nursing school."" (which I found out later wasn't the case, he's just a jerk) My bio class was really difficult, I thought there would be no way I could make it, I didn't have time, it was too hard, etc. 


I changed schools and changed my major to International Relations and have focussed on social justice and poverty alleviation. I've loved every soft science class I have ever taken. I've loved getting involved in Mock UN or Mock Legislature stuff on campus. I've learned a lot and there is absolutely nothing wrong with my major now. 

But I'm not really sure if it is right for me. In may I spent 3 weeks in SE Asia. I loved the people and the culture and the food, but I couldn't picture myself there. There was a lot of job opportunities to teach English, but I don't want to do that. I really can't see myself playing the politics game in the US for long enough to finally get a position overseas. I don't like the idea of law school. Even though I've loved everything I've learned. I just can't figure out how I am suppose to apply that to actual life. When I picture myself living and working overseas, I still see the me that became a nurse. Who can actually help people in real and tangible ways. When I think back to 3 years ago, I am amazed at how much I've grown. I really think I've developed much better study habits and a lot more discipline. I think I could conquer nursing school. 

So now I'm faced with: so what should I do? Should I finish out my senior year, get my bachelor's and then look into nursing programs? My pell grant will run out eventually, I pay for everything myself and I've already taken out loans. I could wait and maybe return to school as an adult if I still think I'm doing the wrong thing in a few years. 


Am I just attempting to avoid the inevitable ""real world"" by staying in school longer?

The reason I'm asking this so close to coming school year is because some recent family issues have come up and if I wanted to go to OU I'd have to wait for the spring since the application deadline has already passed.

I've already taken a year off to save up for a car and now it's time to go back to school. With OU I get: cheaper (I live in OK),  closer to home and I know a lot of people going there. I've heard nothing but great things about it from all my friends who go there. Two guys I know of personally were national merit finalists and they both choose to study ME at OU. Its not the most widely respected engineering school out there but it's still accredited though? Is that all that matters anyways?

With Baylor I get: the prestige of a private university, I could start in the fall and I already love everything there. Another thing is that it's not my dream school but I worked so hard to get in and I don't know how I'd feel if I just gave that up because it'd be more difficult financially? Then there's the bad.. its $60,000/yr (I'd need to pay about half that in loans which I probably can't even get because my parents have TERRIBLE credit), it's farther away and I'd be all by myself.

I just need help deciding here. I know OU is far less expensive and it'd save me in the long run debt wise but would it be wiser to have more debt but a degree from a respected private institution under my belt? Does prestige even matter anymore or is it just the degree? Should I scrounge to get the money to go or take the closer to home/cheaper route?

My facebook and Instagram are flooding with the people I went to high school with graduating this week/today and I feel absolutely devastated that I'm not anywhere near that goal. I was a pretty good student in high school, graduated top 10 and I was part of the national honor society, I had big plans. 
I started going to the university of texas at el paso the same year I graduated and I was going for microbiology. I took classes with a friend who was doing the same thing so we took all our classes together. It didn't go very well and I became very depressed to a point where I had counseling. I wasn't sure this was what I wanted to do but it's what I felt I had to do since my parents always pushed me towards the medical field/medical school. A lot of people, including the school guidance counselor, encouraged me to study illustration or graphic design because of my ability to draw, but I never considered it an option because I felt it wouldn't get me a stable job. 


I got out of UTEP and I decided to go for ultrasound technician at a private school, my friend sticked to UTEP despite how bad it was going for her as well (shes one of the ones graduating today). I found out that to get into the ultrasound technician program I had to become a medical assistant first. So I did, I got a job after I was done as an MA in the mean time while I got into the ultrasound program. Never happened because I began to have family issues and I ended up becoming the one my family depends on money-wise. I can't exactly stop working to go to school full time. I decided that that school was a waste of time and money since they make it so hard to get into any of the imaging programs, so I found out about the ultrasound technician program at the community college in my area. I started taking classes to get into it and now all I need is to take physics and some sort of ranking test to be able to rank for the program, they only take 7 students into this program a year, depending on their GPA and test score. I've gotten As in all my ranking courses so I'm not at a bad place, but I feel like I'm never gonna get there. 


The up-side on all of this is that I began to work at a doctor's office where the doctors and providers (PA's, nurse practitioners) need medical transcriptionists to do documentation and billing for them. I started as a medical assistant but was promoted to scribe. I'm now working with a wonderful doctor who is a nephrologist, specializes in geriatrics, is a licensed surgeon back in Argentina, and became a doctor at 24, he's 38 now. I spend 9 hours a day with him and we've gotten close. He's working at that place (horrible place, may I add) only because of certain circumstances that landed him that job. I don't exactly understand but it has something to do with some sort of waiver. He's explained it before but we don't talk about it much. He was living back in New York before he ended up in El Paso. Long story short, he hates this clinic and the bosses are jerks. He's only trying to finish his contract so that he can get out and work at another practice strictly as a nephrologist. He already signed a contract with a new dialysis company branching into El Paso and he was offered the position of medical director. He promised me to take me with him and employ me, pay me more money, etc. and he mentions that he's glad to have met me because I'm the best scribe/assistant he's ever had. He knows I'm still going for ultrasound technician and has even offered to give me a flexible work schedule while I finish school, and even after I finish, he said he'd employ me as an ultrasound technician as well since nephrologists usually order kidney ultrasounds. 

He's been a huge influence for me and I think he's the only good thing to have come out of my ""college failure"". It's nice to know that I'll have a secure job as long as he's around. But I still feel unfulfilled. I've talked to a lot of people about it and a lot of them are in the same situation I am. Everyone tells me that it's fine to fall behind, that it's normal and it happens to the best of us. That it doesn't matter how old I am or how long it takes to get my degree as long as I get it, and still I can't help but beat myself up whenever I see someone graduating or talking about finishing school and going for even higher education. What I'm doing now is just not what I had planned for myself and I feel like a complete and utter failure. 

I'll be keeping out of fb and instagram for today. Hope you guys have a good weekend. :)

I'm reposting it here in hopes that undergrads might find it useful.


Professor here. We get many requests like this. That is why I tell all my students up front that to get a letter from me they must do three things.

First, earn an A in one of my Junior or Senior classes.

Second, have at least a 3.0 gpa.

Last, and most important, they must have spent time with me outside of class. Pay regular visits during office hours, chat me up during receptions, arrange for me to go to lunch with a group of students. There are many ways. But the crux is this: i can't write a decent letter if I don't know the student. Otherwise, the letter will just be a listing of facts that could have easily been acquired from your transcript.

The last several letters I've written are for students who took my undergraduate research class and who I shepherded through an undergraduate colloquium. I worked with them one-on-one, got to know them, traveled to another city with them. My letters for them were glowing, inspired, and most importantly, full of details as to why these people deserved consideration. If they had just been a face in a crowd, I could not have done that.

So, if you think you might ever need a letter of recommendation for work or for grad school, begin cultivating a relationship with some of your major professors early.

They say that I never returned the student loan check to them and the balance was still outstanding. As I said, I sent the check back to the Loan Company, but apparently I was supposed to give it back to the school. So while I fucked this part up, there was a paper trail that the check was sent to Sallie Mae. I showed the school this info and they would tell me ""OK we will look into it, we are super busy right now."" I kept getting this same reply over and over for three years until my debt got sent to state collections. Since 2014, my state tax refund has been getting garnished to pay for this debt I don't owe.

I called my mom who lives in the state still to try and help me out, to go down to the school and talk to them in person. In 2015 she did a ton of work and we sent all this info to a lady in charge of financial aid. She told me she was close to getting to the bottom of this and she doesn't think I cashed the check.

I thought the situation was resolved, but low and behold, I got another tax return garnished by the state. 
Honestly, I can deal with the slow battle for this stupid fucking debt, but now my college career is on the line. I know you are supposed to report all your previous transcripts to any schools you attend, but I went to a community college in 2015 and I don't remember putting that I went to any other schools on my application. I did two semesters, got great grades, then went to another CC (we moved to a new area), didn't tell them I went to School A, am about to finish the semester with a 4.0. I am applying for University now and I need to send my transcripts to the University, so here's where I get fucked. These are the players:

School A (1st community college I ""owe money to"") 

School B (2nd community college) 

School C (3rd community college) 

School D (University)

Apparently, I put that I attended School A on my school B transcripts (I don't remember doing this, I am thinking they have a way of looking at a students entire school career online or something? School B wants transcripts from school A before they can send my transcripts to School C and D.
School C needs my transcripts from School B before they will send my transcripts to school D
School A won't send my official transcripts until the debt has been taken care of.

Now I am fucked, I was just going to lie and say I never attended school A, as a lot of the classes I took I had taken in school A and either failed or got a C (but have no gotten a B or A in after taking them again).
I am thinking of saying I made a mistake and that I never attended school A, and that I must have meant that is where I got my GED (technically I did, thats where you took the test). This will only work if they didn't find it out on their own.

I called School A and told them ""what the fuck, I need this shit resolved like pronto, what's the the hold up?"" They said now they have to see if the cash was checked, something that should have been done before but wasn't. They don't know how long this will take.

So here I am, back to square A, but now with ALL of my transcripts on hold due to fucking school A. I don't know how to make them figure this shit out faster, it's been four years and nothing has come of it, now I am losing money and if I don't figure this out before the start of the summer semester, I won't be able to enroll, pushing my finishing date back even further. This is all I can think to do right now:

Plan A) Call School B and tell them that I never took college courses at school A, I simply took my GED there and I must have not made that clear on the application. Hopefully they don't investigate further, but if they do, then I could possibly be tried for school misconduct for lying about not attending a school before

Plan B) Keep working to resolve this issue with School A over the phone and with my mom in person. I don't live in the same state anymore, so I can't go in person myself. Hope it is resolved in a week so I can continue my life.

Plan C) Get a fucking lawyer, start putting legal pressure on them to figure this out. Only problem is a lawyer costs money, is it worth losing money to get it resolved when I wouldn't get more than like 300 bucks back from my garnished tax returns?

Problems I see arising: If I get the issue with School A cleared and send my transcripts, it's going to fuck with my GPA, all those F's are going to drop me like crazy. This is why I didn't want to use them originally. I am a great student now, but this will bury me and possibly ruin my chances to get into a nursing program. I know its academic dishonesty to not send transcripts from all school, but should I keep up the lie and just try to get out of sending it to school B? I didn't put it on my app for school C or D, but if school B gets them, they will probably appear on my official transcript, right?
I have no idea what to do...

**TL;DR:** Went to a CC from 2004-2009 on and off, didn't do well. Took out a student loan my last semester, never cashed it, sent it back to loan company when I should have sent it to the school. School has me on the books for the $3000 check. Been battling for 4 years to get it resolved, still no resolution.
Went back to school in different state, thought I didn't mention School A at all. Apparently I did, they want my transcripts from them before they can issue my transcripts to two other school requiring them, stalling my entry into University. I can't move forward until School A debt issue is resolved
I can try to lie to school B about attending school A, saying I didn't take college courses there, but then I could get caught in the lie and really get screwed for student misconduct.

764,matergallina,1461405933,/r/college/comments/4g2xci/finally_getting_things_together_is_my_plan_too/,"Background, but I'll try to make it easier follow.

I am 27, a wife and a mom of 3 with one on the way. Currently we live in an apartment, with both me and my husband working part-time. Husband is disabled, but SSI/SSDI is out of the question for now.

I have bipolar II. When I was 18/19 I tried conventional college at a tech school in a different state, was manic and didn't even try. Basically incompletes in every class. Next semester Not-very-kind-NParent forced me to move back home and enroll at the local community college. Again, still manic, and you can't force a manic person to do anything, whether they want to do it or not, so incompletes and fails. I just stopped attending halfway through both semesters.

Long story short, moved on, met husband, tried to responsible up and went to beauty school. It was an easy-out for me. (Sister did it, parents want me to be just liker her, etc.) Finished, completed, licensed, worked in a salon for a year. HATED IT. My life was HELL. I will never cut anyone's hair besides family EVER AGAIN. But now I'm stuck with the loan from this schooling.

That was years ago. I've moved on to farming for a season, then to retail where I'm at now. I want more for my life. I want to provide more competently for my family. My husband is sick a lot and I want to do as much as I can for my family because his plate is so full all the time.

So, I want to go back to school! This time of my own volition, in a field I enjoy. I've spent years thinking about what industry because I don't want my decision to be a spur-of-the-moment manic choice. I'm 99% sure I want to go into finance. Specifically I'd love to be a corporate cost/efficiency analyst.

I know how much schooling it entails, I'm prepared to work hard and dive in. My only qualm is money, for school and living expenses.

There's family housing at the community college I want to attend. 
It'd be perfect for my family. The cost is actually honestly a little cheaper than our apartment now. But you can pay in one lump sum per year. If we use our whole tax return, it'd cover all of housing costs besides power. So we wouldn't have to pay a lot of bills each month. That brings down the necessary amount to earn per month WAAAY down, meaning I can devote more time to school, I could even go full-time. A grant for the full amount would cover all of my school costs. We're on medicaid and SNAP so no medical bills and our grocery bill is very very low.

Does it sound like this has been thought out? Am I forgetting something? The worst part of bipolar is not being able to fully trust myself when coming up with ideas/plans.

(I do plan on visiting the disability center and getting any accommodations I might need, and going to office hours if I need to. I refuse to let the past happen again!)

765,Coffeeandglitter,1461123990,/r/college/comments/4flihz/i_feel_so_behind_compared_to_everyone_else/,"To make a long story short, I have been attending a community college that gets you prepared for a four year college for about a year and a half now-- and I'm not even close to being finish with my prerequisites. The reason behind this is because of where I fall financially. I'm too broke to pay cash (around $1600 per QUARTER/8 weeks) but also, too ""rich"" to get any free money. So sadly, I'm taking out loans to attend a FREAKING community college while everyone else is getting theirs paid for by their parents. My parents have the money, but they choose not to help me, and that's fine. It's their money.

Because of my loan situation, the amount they give me every quarter isn't enough to attend full time. Full time at my college is 3 classes per 8 weeks. My federal loans BARELY cover 2. So, I'm pretty behind. Not to mention I had a bad quarter a few months back where I failed both of my courses, which essentially set me back even more. What makes it even worse, is that they won't allow me to borrow during the summer, and I don't have $600 bucks to pull out of my ass. So, I'm pretty bitter right now, and I hate it.

 Everyone that I started college with is in their last quarter and has already applied and been accepted to their programs. 

Sorry for the ranting, I am just ready to move on with my life and finish my prerequisites so I can apply to nursing school... But it's so hard when you don't have the resources that everyone else has. 

Has anyone else gone through something similar? How did you cope? I'm so frustrated!

I called them today and got directed to voicemail. I don't know what's happening with them right now but as it stands I'm trying to move on with the rest.

At college #1 there's about a yearly cost of $15,000 p/y involved. I qualified for a grant of 3k from the state and the loans I'm eligible for after FAFSA come to 2000 to 3500. Overall I have about $11,715.00 of financial aid. It's a smaller campus with no dorms. After 2 years you transfer over to the main campus to finish your degree. It's much, much cheaper than college #2, even after factoring in needing to probably rent an apartment to go there because I live too far to reliably commute. I'm hesitant to go there because of being waitlisted at my #1 choice and having to get up and go across the state to change campuses 2 years in. 

The other is out of state and I don't qualify for state aid as a result. Their need-based grant is about $4,000 which is a lot less than I was hoping as I'm in a single parent household and the other parent doesn't live in the country. After the aid, work-study and FAFSA, things come to $12,100 in aid. However, the cost of attending the university comes to around 50k a year. Not much I can do to afford it right now. I like the school, it was the first to accept me, it's fairly highly rated particularly in the apartment I would like to major in, but I can't afford to take out all of the loans that I'd need to go there. I already know I won't be able to pay it back in a reasonable time frame in any of the careers I'm interested in.

This weekend I've got a visit scheduled to College 2 and I have the chance to file a financial aid counseling session with the school. The question is, what would they discuss in those sessions? I'm assuming it's just telling me stuff I already know about the work study program and aid. Is there any way to appeal for a better financial aid package or is it likely that they won't budge? 

If not I'll probably just cancel the visit and put the deposit down for college #1. ",college,Financial aid counseling?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4dhygy/financial_aid_counseling/,1459901260.0
767,endozoic,1459868032,/r/college/comments/4dgrag/i_feel_like_a_failure_because_im_flunking_out_and/,"Hey fellow collegiate members,

(this is kind of a long post, sorry)

So I was really unsure earlier this year of what I wanted to do with my life. I wasn't sure if I wanted to stick with my criminal justice major or get into computer science. I still have more of an interest in computer science than I do criminal justice and I find myself doing way better in my programming classes.

The other issue is I'm a really horrible student for everything else. I'm not ready for university even though I've been here for two years. People I ask around me say that I just have to sit down and really focus and stop making excuses for myself. I just find that I'm not doing well because I can't force myself to focus and learn the material even when my grades are on the line. I guess criminal justice just really has me disinterested now.
 
It's too late at this point to bring my grades up to keep my financial aid at this university. Last year I took 6 classes, 18 credits and lost my mind trying to keep up with my jobs and school. I failed two classes. This semester I wanted to take 4 classes to make things a little easier for me, and it definitely has, but I'm still on the verge of failing two classes. I need an 87 on everything from here until May to pass the course with a 60. In my other class, I need a 80 on everything going forward to pass the class with a C. Basically, I don't believe in myself enough to do that. I'd rather not stress myself out trying to pass as I already have a lot of stress on my plate. But either way, if I fail just one class this semester, it'll bring me down to 21 credits for the year, below the minimum to receive financial aid. So either way, it'd be really hard to pass everything and get a 2.0 min GPA. Maybe it's me being lazy or maybe it's just me not getting it. My head just isn't in the right place right now.

I have three jobs and I'm a full time student and I find it's also really hard to support myself, live on my own-make bill payments, and go to school. My family doesn't support me financially whatsoever so that's a big factor as to why I'm so busy. 

Anyway, I have already decided that I need to take time off and get my head in the right place. I'm just wondering if anybody has gone through the same thing -- to be honest, I feel like a really big failure. It really sucks because I'm really hardworking and I'd love to just sit down and focus and study on something I love but I think that Criminal Justice wasn't something I wanted to do and I really messed it up. I feel like I could do a lot better in Computer Science or programming and web development because I'm a very hands on person but now I'm at that point where I can't even attempt CS because I won't be able to go back to school next semester. Has anybody gone through something like this or similar to this? Is it okay to feel like you don't belong at this point? How do you feel about gap years? 

Anyway, input would be really appreciated.

tldr - i'm failing out of college and i'm going to lose my financial aid, but i'm not ready for school. what do i do and have you gone through something similar?

I am a finance major trying to get my GPA up. Cumulative, it's not great, at a 2.8. My school has a rule that you can't retake a class for a better grade if it is a C or higher, which some of my grades were.

Here is my dilemma. One class I am taking is hard. The teacher is great, but the material is hard to learn. The last test I failed with a 58, and the class average was a 65. She also does not curve or give out extra credit. I do prepare for this class, and study weeks in advance for the tests, as well as go to review sessions, but it's just a hard class. 

I pay for my college. Yes, I get some aid, but I pay about $1200 per semester. Because of this, I don't really have time for summer school because I work my butt off in the summer trying to pay for school in the fall and spring. It might be tough to eve get a B-, and this will not help my GPA at all. Someone suggested if it looks bleak, intentionally screw up the final. That way I can retake it in the summer for a better grade. Another thing btw, one summer class without aid is about $1200. 

I am stuck. My best just might not be good enough and I could end up with a C, which sucks for my GPA, or retake it in the summer while sabotaging myself.

I feel very overwhelmed about college in general. When I first came to college, being a slacker and partying, I received average grades, and now my GPA is pretty mediocre (2.8). For a finance major like me, that is not good at all. All I hear is how hard it will be, from peers and even the assistant dean, to get a job after college with such a low GPA. I started doing things to get educated, and I feel even more lost then ever.

My first choice was to switch to accounting. I got a B+ in accounting 1, and I kinda liked it, so I started to lean toward that decision because even if I had a sub par GPA.  Then after joining an organization, talking to people in the industry, I decided not to. Why? Everyone wants a CPA. I have to add a major to even sit for the test, which is more money I have to pay, and more loans that I have to take out. (I work and go to school to pay for it.) Then I have to study for a LONG time, and hopefully pass. Another thing I learned, people want at least a 3.0 for an internship. I start thinking I need to bring my GPA up, and I get some good grades, but things aren't going great this semester. I am fighting for B-'s. I study a lot, and can't seem to get good test scores. I also try not to cram, and start weeks in advance, like the test I took today. I was so confident, looked at my test, and ended up guessing on like 10 questions because I ran out of time. It's also one of the classes I am fighting for a B- in. 

The way I see it, I feel like I'm doomed. People say ""The degree matters more than the GPA."" but I am having trouble believing that now. I'm struggling for an internship, there's all this pressure, and I could not afford to fail that test today, and I did, or so I think. 

Where will I be in 10 years? I might have a degree, but I might still be flipping burgers. I work hard, but I just am not smart enough to get good grades. I have no confidence in my academic abilities, and I almost want to drop out.

When I was graduating high school I wondered what I wanted to do with my life. I had always liked math in school, and I liked kids, so I had initially wanted to be a math teacher. But when I came up for my freshman year in college, I realized math is hard and my dad had been pressuring me to become a computer science major and so I decided to make the switch. I convinced myself that computers are cool and I must love them since I enjoy spending so much time playing video games so it seemed like a reasonable switch. 

I now realize that this was a mistake. My classes are full of people who have basically been programming their entire lives and already know how to do many things in these classes, so while they breeze by easily I have struggled always with assignments and have been trying to keep it together. When I try going to professors or my TA's for help on assignments I was treated strangely, with them always being surprised I guess at how little I knew. Eventually I started getting so anxious visiting them that I stopped entirely and now basically submit non-working programming assignments, get a bit of partial credit, and just try and do good on exams (which are all theory) and hope that they can offset my awful grade in programming.

Everyday when I wake up it takes me 1-2 hours to get out of bed, because I just simply lay there, terrified of what the day is going to throw at me. Some days I wake up and just skip all my classes, because I can't bring the strength in me to go to them. I am perpetually worried about my student loans because of how many I had to take as I was offered basically no financial aid besides loans and a scholarship for my high school GPA. The only reason I haven't offed myself yet is because my parents are cosigner to a bunch of my loans and if I die and they have to pay them back they will be financially ruined and my whole family will tank. I had wanted to drop out of college after my first year and join the military, but my parents basically forbade me and convinced me into staying. I haven't talked to any doctors or anything about this because I don't want to be disqualified from joining the military, as I see it almost as an escape from this situation. To me it looks like a chance to simply get away from all of this, yet even then if I joined the military I would have to start paying back my loans and I am not sure I would be paid enough to handle them. 

Instead of doing work I have basically been playing video games to cope with this feeling, except now they aren't even enough anymore. Even video games disgust me, and I sort of just sit around and listed to music all day in my room. I am at around $50000 in loans I think right now total, and if I go to school next year will be at around $75000. I just want to drop out and die, but despite how much I hate everyone at this point, I don't want to burden my parents with the loans, even though a lot of this I feel (internally) stems from their actions. I am not sure what to do, and I am not sure where to write this. I browse this subreddit somewhat and maybe someone else here might be able to relate to this and give me advice.

I transfered to a new college and am considered out of state. When I should be getting 1200 a semester for half time, I am getting like 300. This forced me to take loans out.

This last semester I took 6 units, dropped a class because the structure was fucked up and had only tests and quizzes with no assignments, and thought I'd get a refund so I could add another 3 unit class which is an 8 week course.  I guess I dropped the class 2 days after the official drop date (this college only allows you to drop it after 2 days! while my last college gave you a month!)

I didn't even have enough money to even pay the class for withdrawing which was 700 dollars so I asked my brother to barrow 700 so I could pay the class and add another class. Meanwhile I took out another loan to pay my brother back and have enough money to last me the semester. I can only take out a loan when enrolled with 6 credits.

I took out the loan of  3500 and noticed now I have a charge of 3100 dollars on my account. They say because I ""attempted"" 9 units that I went over the 6 units and am being charged an out of state fee. They are automatically taking out 3100 from my loan leaving me with  400 dollars. Not enough to even pay my brother back and I now he can't even pay the rent and bills. The college assured me I would get this loan and didn't notify me about this ""attempted"" 9 units crap.

I went to the school and pleaded with them my whole situation and they just all reply ""it's policy and there's nothing we can do"". Fucking just destroyed my life and robbed me of thousands of dollars. My family is low income while this college is taking money from someone poor like me. This is criminal behavior and I don't understand how I am expected to know something like this. I don't even have enough money for food now.

It's enough to be comfortable, but I couldn't afford a sketch pad she was asking for me to have specifically. I really didn't see anyone else in the class with a sketch pad as big as the one she wanted me to get, so I explained to her I didn't have the money, but I could make it work by taping paper together from my smaller sketch pads that I already own. She immediately told me this wasn't good enough. I can't remember the dialogue word-for-word, but she ended up asking me about my government financial assistance, which by the way is the only way I'm even at college as well as scholarships and pell grants (I'm completely loan free thanks to them.), she said that they should just pay for it. I told her that's not how it worked and I had a different contract with them that only provides textbooks, tuition and fees.

775,that_veg,1458088184,/r/college/comments/4alc9f/my_dad_doesnt_want_me_to_major_in_what_ive/,"The title is exactly the way it sounds. I'm a sophomore in an out of state college and have barely gotten close to past the GenEds stage of college yet I have already declared a major in Exercise Science/Kinesiology, Pre Physical Therapy. This major is science heavy, and it turns out I actually really dislike science and am not doing well enough to get into a grad school in my important major courses (I have done fine in my GenEds). I'm a terrible test taker and I don't retain memorized knowledge very well. I am better at learning when I have an actual physical task at hand. I did terribly in my second general Chemistry course and I am doing even worse in Anatomy. My advisor warned me that if I do poorly in courses like Anatomy and Physiology, graduate school is almost out of the question. It's only going to keep getting more difficult.

I figured out that I am really passionate about writing. I thought about changing my major to something more English-related about 5-6 months ago. I realized I wasn't happy in my science courses and I couldn't continue faking it for my parents, who both had/have science careers. I decided journalism seems like something for me - every teacher or professor that I have encountered in an English related setting has told me I have some kind of talent for writing - and I felt like a very tangible career could come from this. I met with an advisor to get my credits in order - I have 57 credit hours in my kinesiology major, and those would transfer over to the journalism major perfectly, meaning I can still graduate on time. We got all my classes for the next four semesters lined up for registration.

I waited a few weeks to hit my parents with the news. I told my dad first and his response was not at all what I expected. Right when I told him ""Hey, dad, I've been thinking that I am going to change my major to journalism."" Right off the bat, he said there is no career in journalism. Then he said immediately after that if I pursue that as my major, he is not going to pay for it and I can come home and take a year off to figure myself out and finish out my degree at home because he's not going to waste any more money on me. The funny thing is, it's taken me two years to finally feel like I know what I want to do. Not only that, but it's taken me this long to finally build up a community for myself that I feel comfortable in at my college, I've joined a cultural sorority, and I've been really involved in campus and I can't see myself letting that go. If I take a year off of school, how am I going to figure out what I want to do if I'm not taking classes that harbor that kind of growth and self-actualization?

My school is expensive, but he's not realizing that I wouldn't be attending 3+ years of graduate school on top of my out-of-state tuition already if I pursued journalism. He would rather see me unhappy making a decent check in a science career than to see me in a writing/arts career. All of the sudden he has decided that he no longer has the money to pay for my school, because scholarships and financial aid as well as me working as much as possible don't exist outside of his bank account. I'm willing to do what I can to stay exactly where I am.

This morning he sent me this email:
""I just want to write to you to tell you what is on our minds regarding school plans and what I think you need to do over the next year.

With the cost of out of state tuition at [college x] we would have to consume all or our non retirement savings which would leave no emergency funds in case I lost my job if you were to remain at [college x]. Given that your are uncertain about your major and you want to change plans with school I think the best thing for you to do would to be to come home in June and finish your education here, maybe take a year off to work to get a better idea of what you want to do continuing your education. There is nothing wrong with taking time to make a good decision for your future. I am not sure how you became interested in photo journalism. I am sure that you could pursue that here as well as at [college x].""

I have felt for the past two years that my parents have been looking for reasons to pull me out of this school due to the out of state fees. It's funny because, just last summer, my dad was arguing against my mom to keep me going here - she wanted me to take a year off and stay home and work, and he wouldn't let her decide that for me.

I sent an email back explaining my stance and reasoning, and it was quite long. Has anyone been in a similar situation? I understand that my dad pays the checks, but I feel like it doesn't give him the right to disallow me to attend college because I am not pursuing the major he wants me to.",college,My dad doesn't want me to major in what I've decided to,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4alc9f/my_dad_doesnt_want_me_to_major_in_what_ive/,1458106184.0

My mom always files for a tax extension, and so she always files right up to the October 15th deadline. In previous years, she's estimated her income on the FAFSA and CSS Profile, and that has satisfied my school's financial aid office. This year, there's a new policy. My mom has to submit her 2015 taxes before I get any aid. The fall semester starts on September 8th, the tuition bill is due on October 8th, and if you miss that deadline, you get forcibly withdrawn from the school. So if my mom files her taxes on October 15th and it gets processed by November 15th, I will have to withdraw.

I have talked to the financial aid office. They said that no matter when my mom submits her tax return, I will get the same aid I've gotten every other year. Basically they said I would have to pay $20K+ up front and then I'd get that refunded when my mom's tax return goes through. I cannot afford that (I can't qualify for a loan of that magnitude, and I don't have a cosigner) which is why I'd have to withdraw.

My question: Because of this situation, I'll be taking classes from September 8th to October 8th and then withdraw from the school. Can I re-enroll in those same classes in mid-November when her tax return is processed? Taking 5-ish weeks off will murder my grades, but at least I won't be a drop out. Taking the semester off isn't really an option because it's hard to re-enroll when you've been out of school for over 6 months.

777,snero1994,1457306610,/r/college/comments/499qea/advice_appreciated/,"Hi there,

To give some context, I'm a female in my early 20s who's finally about to graduate this May from a community college I've been attending for 3 years (did this while working full time) with my associates degree. 

However, now the big problem/question is what to do next. 

My plan was/is to go into secondary education in order to teach math to middle and/or high school students. I applied to 5 schools (2 public and 3 private schools) and 4 of them are in my state (IL.) I was accepted into 1 public school in my state, the 2 private schools in my state, and the 1 private school out of state. I was offered scholarships to all 3 of the private schools.

The down side is, even with the scholarships the private schools are just as expensive (if not more so) than the public school. At each school I'd be looking at about $15,000 a year in loans JUST for tuition. So, more realistically, I'd be looking at more like $25,000 a year for tuition and to help with living expenses as I physically don't think I can handle working full time and going to school full time anymore (especially because in order to keep receiving scholarships and to be a teacher in IL you have to maintain at least a 3.0 GPA I believe.)

The point is, I'm really worried about how I would do this. Some of these loans would have to be private loans so I know the interest rates would be higher. Also, I already have about $10,000 in federal loans from attending the community college. So, in total I'd be looking at least $60,000 in student debt (and probably more than that because student teaching will require me to have closer to 3 more years left.) I am especially worried because my friend just told me (who is in about $60,000 in school debt) that after he graduates in May his student loan payment will be over $700/month! 

I know as a teacher I won't make much more than I am now (make about $25,000/year now) and my family is little to no help as I pay for my rent, groceries, car payment, etc. all my myself (although most bills are split with my live-in S/O.) I really want to finish school and I don't want to disappoint my family, but I've grown up poor and I'm terrified of spending my adult life being poor too. 

Oh, also I'm worried because I live in a stupid state with a terrible governor who is sucking colleges dry and not giving out MAP grants so I'm worried about not getting the grant money I was offered and/or being part of my way through finishing and the school closes and/or loses its accreditation. 

So, first of all, thank you to anyone who's made it this far. I'm just really unsure what to do and it's giving me terrible anxiety. Should I wait until I'm 24 (when I can take my parents off my FAFSA) and hope I will get more assistance as well as that IL will be in a better state than it is now? Should I suck it up and just deal with possibly being in WAY over my head with debt? 

Any and all advice is appreciated as I don't really have many people I can turn to and anyone I've talked to really doesn't understand that I literally have NO ONE I can rely on financially if shit hits the fan and I can't pay my loans/rent/etc. 

TL:DR I am about to graduate with my associates degree in live in IL. I am trying to decide whether it's worth putting off school until hopefully my state gets its shit together and I don't have to count my parents financial information anymore or just suck it up and possibly get in way over my head in debt as I have no one to turn to financially.",college,Advice Appreciated!,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/499qea/advice_appreciated/,1457324610.0
778,Mikeb1123,1457144751,/r/college/comments/490mle/feeling_really_lost/,"Hi.

I am feeling quite lost and hopeless when it comes to my post graduation life. Allow me to explain.

I am a sophomore and I have two years left in my college career. I am currently majoring in corporate finance, but I was torn between that and accounting. I really like finance, and I am still learning about accounting, all though it's okay so far. I was torn between the two majors because, most importantly, I am looking for a well paying job after college. A stable career. Well, with what I've learned and been told, it seems like I may very well be struggling after I graduate, and may be a server with a college degree.

You see, my GPA is not great. Accumulative, it's a 2.8. My business/econ major is a 3.3. I slacked a lot earlier in college, and thankfully I saw the errors in my ways, but possibly too late. My goal is to have a 3.0 accumulative by the time I graduate. I have about 2 years, but I am beginning to feel like it's not going to be possible. I work to pay for school, so finances are obviously important, or I can't go to school. I can study and study, but I also have to work, and I've never been a great test taker, so I am afraid it will never be a 3.0. Even if I got B's for the rest of my classes, it would sit at a 2.9. What are the odds of me, or anyone, getting straight A's in advance finance and accounting classes? Maybe someone who can commit a lot of time to school, or who is naturally talented in academics. Not exactly me.

How this all ties in? Finance is incredibly competitive. I've been told things such as I need ATLEAST a 3.5 to get any sort of job. People told me I might be better off switching to accounting because finance is so competitive. I am not looking for a high paying job right out of college, all though that would nice. I am looking for something maybe at 40k a year to start, and I am willing to work my way up if possible. Also, people tell me banks hire all kinds of majors, and mostly everything can be learned through training, making the degree a bit useless. Others tell me statistically speaking, I will end up in insurance sales such as Northwestern Mutual, which also doesn't need a degree. I get a lot of crap about my major from my accounting and engineer friends, and I just don't want to major in it and end up selling insurance or not find a job at all.

Okay, so accounting may be the way to go. I kinda like accounting, it's not a bad career choice, and maybe my GPA doesn't need to be super high to find any kind of work. Then I talked to some accountants, and I got equally disappointed. Let me state this, I had no real interest in the CPA exam. I don't have the money to stay in school any longer then what I can afford, so the CPA exam, needing 150 credit hours, might not work out. Apparently, accounting without a CPA is like philosophy without law school. ""Good luck fining a job. I guess you could be a book keeper or sales clerk."" Yes, people have actually told me this. Well crap.

What are my options exactly? All I want is a job out of college that pays 40k a year. I'll even do 30k. I just don't want all my schooling to be for nothing. As I believe I said before, I am trying my best to join organizations, and I will try my best to get good grades, and I will try to get internships (I'm not sure who would give me a shot with my GPA.), but I can't help but feel stuck, and I will be that way even after I graduate.",college,Feeling really lost,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/490mle/feeling_really_lost/,1457162751.0

I am a community college student taking general studies as a major.
I plan to transfer into a university next Fall. However, I am confused on what else to major in if things does not work out.
I regret majoring in my backup plan first rather than doing my general ed's because now I hate computer science. 
I thought I had liked coding. I had goals to create a social media app but, that didn't work out as you can see. I knew if I couldn't enjoy my classes what made me think that I would enjoy developing a new social media app and a lot of time and money goes into that. I did however, enjoy creating websites when I was in high school. I took a few web development classes. But after, awhile I started looking at everyone's else's work and they were so much more better than mines. I guess, I got discouraged also, because the fact that I found it difficult when it came to coding the HTML. Even though, it was only the basics and I felt stupid for that. I did try other majors as well such as art and music my main two passions but, they didn't work out and also, the jobs doesn't pay well unless you know someone from a good company and have a killer portfolio.
I thought about going into the medical field for a while but, I don't have the brains for that. I don't make straight A's and never have. It's difficult for me to do so.
I don't know what else to do! I don't want to go back into computer science because I can't see myself doing that as a career.
My other options aren't that great. I don't want to work retail for the rest of my life. If I do find a job. 
What should I do? I have been to technical college first and then community college. There are no trade schools where I live.
I'm just lost as to what to do next.
I don't even have mentors around my area or at my school to help.
I know at least two things about myself: I am not cut out for the medical field or for the STEM field like I thought I was going to be.
What helped you figure out what you wanted to do?
I'm only 20 years old and I'm trying to at least figure out a part of my life.

780,MelAnnClare,1456209257,/r/college/comments/475el0/dealing_with_childish_roommates/,"This will be lengthy so please bare with me. 

I moved into an college apartment home in mid August with three other girls I knew in high school. We each have our own bed &amp;amp; bathroom so the only shared space is the living room and kitchen. It all started out fine. 
We would grocery shop individually and have our own section in the fridge and freezer. However, I did buy my own mini fridge to stick in my room, and it's filled to the max. I also use part of my closet as a pantry. Over time, I began to notice that some of my food (stuff in the freezer to be exact) was missing but I didn't think anytime of it at the time. 

When we came back from Christmas break, they were all being extremely loud one night around midnight. The next morning I texted them politely asking if they could be more aware of how loud they were being after 10pm? Perhaps no more blasting the tv or ruining the washer/dryer. I got no response and they're still loud every night. 

Well, around three weeks ago we experienced some really low temperatures, around 20 degrees. I'm really cold one night while trying to fall asleep so I turn the thermostat up to 70 degrees. Now keep in mind that my room is the farthest away form the heater and I have two windows in my room that I do not think are properly sealed, while the other girls just have one. The next day roommate 1 (RM1) flips the hell out and sends a group message her basically saying we need to check our vents to make sure they're open and if we're still cold sleep with more blankets because she's sweating because she's so hot at night with two fans on. She pretty much demanded that no one touches it. I sleep with FIVE blankets and I'm still cold so I think there's a problem because I'm not normally cold. We all pay for electricity so she can't demand anything. I have a right to control/adjust it just like she does. 

The weekend passes and nothing happens. The following Monday I got cold again and bumped it up just a smidge, no more than 3 degrees. Once again RM1 flips out and this time tapes a note over the thermostat saying ""Seriously, I asked nicely. You can stop now.""

She is not willing to compromise on a comfortable temperature and she's slowly killing me. The temperate inside does not need to match the freezing temperature outside. 

Well today, I went to go fix dinner (reheat leftovers really) and I notice someone ate my food yet again. Well at this point I had had it with all their crap, so I texted in a group message to all three of them that I'd appreciate it if they didn't eat my food that I bought, because I don't eat their food. I bought my own set of Tupperware containers to store my food in, nothing like they have. All three of them denied EVER eating my food. They made me look like a fool when I know they're lying.  

In addition to this, they also bring over random people unannounced and those guests then spend the night on the couch without telling us in advance. It's one thing, if one person is spending the night in your room, but it's another if three people are passed out in the common area, and we don't get s heads up beforehand. 

We are all adults, so I do not understand why they cant hold a civil conversation. Unfortunately, I'm stuck in my lease into July, but I really can't survive any longer in this hostile environment. I feel like they hate me for no reason, when I'm the one who always does the dishes, takes the trash out, and cleans. 

TL:DR; how do I survive until July with my ungrateful childish roommates?

My background is this: I graduated high school last May, took a gap semester in the fall, and now this spring I'm enrolled part time at my local community college. I'm only taking one 3-credit course. 

My original idea was to start off part time to get back into schooling, and continue full-time in the fall at my local CC. But due to some recent events I want to leave town and go to school somewhere else. 

One answer is to save up and move and attend a CC there; that is an option. However, I'm also looking at cheap state universities that have relatively cheap out of state tuition so that I could move into that university's dorms/housing so that I can focus on school and not have to worry about bills and all. The issue I'm running into is that I might be considered a transfer student since I'm currently taking a 3 credit class. Some of the colleges I'm looking at require a minimum number of credits to transfer. I'd be okay with retaking those credits if need be, it'd be the price I pay I suppose, if it means getting into a university. 

So does anyone know if I'd be considered a transfer student? Or if there's a way around it in the event that I am? Thanks for any advice! 

Also: I'm also looking at a trade school in state to go for HVAC; they have an agreement with a neighboring state uni that allows trade school students there to live in the state uni's dorms. The idea being I could train in HVAC and work in the field to support myself while getting through college. If anyone has advice on that, that would be appreciated too, though this is more of a side note.

1. My parents make too much for me to get anything but federal loans, which don't even cover the entire cost of schooling, and they can't afford parent plus loans. I am 20 years old and can't work. I also do NOT expect my parents to help me at all. I've always expected that I will pay for school.

2. I don't know what to study or do with my life. I'm considering going into trade school to be a ultrasound technician or something because there is no way for me to pay for school without going into horrible amounts of debt. Due to my illness it's hard to say what I'm passionate about anymore, but I will rattle off a few things that interest me: knit/crochet, poetry, rock history, plants (their uses), cooking, the environment, computers, video games.

Honestly, I really need some advice.  I'm twenty-one years old and have an awkward history with two colleges so far that I believe will prevent me from getting into another college.  After I graduated high school I moved in with my parents.  I first went to a state college nearby to start taking pre-major, basic college classes.  I went there for a year and didn't do well, primarily because I didn't take my classes seriously.  A childish mistake, I know.  The next year I'd transferred to a private school half-way across the country.  I was suffering from depression at the time.  Well, more so than now.  I thought that if I forced myself into a situation where I didn't have family to rely on, where I was living in a dorm that I was going into debt to pay for, that would motivate me to do better.  I performed worse, missed classed, and failed two classes.  Before it was too late, I dropped out, one semester in.  Needless to say, I was a wreck for a while.  For the past year and a month I've been working on coping with my depression and learning to live with it as positively as I can.  I've made some good progress, but that doesn't change my mistakes and awkward educational situation.

Now I'm trying to apply to take online classes at UA, and I'm completely uncertain whether or not I can actually apply anywhere.  Is it legal for me to not list that school as one that I've attended?  Can I request my first college to send transcripts instead?  Even better, is it possible to ""start fresh"" (since my grades weren't great there either and I'm starting from scratch) by sending them my ACT and highschool transcript?

I have a high GPA and have just been accepted into a fairly prestigious internship downtown.

Now, the problem: For those 7 semesters I've had zero social/extracurricular life and minimal independence. I always returned home soon after class and felt uncomfortable coming home late because my parents would get worried/upset. I didn't want to cause family tension by pushing the issue so I kept my head down and kept thinking of the money I was saving. I'm introverted and not a party type. I'm here for the education, not for random socialization, I thought.

But over the last year I've become more unhappy with this arrangement. I've been occasionally invited to activities with some acquaintances I made, but I always had to refuse. I hit rock bottom over this Christmas/New Year when I spent over two weeks with literally nobody to talk to except my parents. I'm not sure this is healthy at my age. Suffice to say I feel lonely, especially when realizing that almost every college senior has a developed social/professional network by now.

I'm on track to graduate in fall 2016 and part of me really just wants to live on my own at this point. My parents say they can help me pay for an apartment w/roommate(s) somewhere for a semester (I have a little money of my own &amp; will work over the summer). But they are not enthusiastic about it and think I'm being unreasonable when I can just stay with them another year and save lots more money.

My parents already live close to the university and we're next to lots of public transportation. My internship will be time consuming and I wouldn't be around the house much anyway. I'd feel guilty for taking my parents' money at this point when I've saved them 98% of college expenses already. It doesn't make financial sense. Plus there's no guarantee that I will feel less lonely or more engaged if I move away. What's the point if I'm going to be moving out in a year anyway?... Still, I can't convince myself.

I've changed my major to computer science and am really excited, but now I don't feel like I want to attend OSU anymore. I've joined clubs and have gotten involved and I haven't made many friends, the food is awful, and I'm so far away from friends/family/boyfriend, which can't be helped as a parking pass is around 600$. Not only that, its much more expensive than what the second school I had applied to last year was and I received less aid.  


Now, if I go to Kent State University, I can say that I commute and live 1 mile off campus with my boyfriend and close friend. Not only that, but based off of the aid offered to me when I was accepted last year, I might not have to pay a single cent out of pocket and my school would be completely paid for through grants and anything left over could be subsidized loans.  


So reddit, even though the school I'm currently at has a much better standing, would it be a better idea to complete the rest of my college career at Kent? And if so, how do I convince my parents to talk to me again if I switch? I've brought it up before and they wouldn't even allow it to be a discussion. Please help.

I had adhd since I was little, so it was always hard for me to pay attention in school. I basically never did very well. 

My mom was out of the picture and my dad was a POS that would never help me get medication for my adhd. 

I always messed up and almost flunked out of freshman year of high school. So my dad decided to convince to get out of school and go into an accelerated program. I get all my credits but couldn't pass geometry TAKS so I basically failed high school. 

I went to job corps in Arkansas and got my diploma. (not what I went into it for, but did come out with a better attitude about life in general)

I attend Texas A&amp;M.
After my sophomore year of Fall 13-Spring 14, I volunteered for deployment. 
I left on good terms and good grades, but owed an excess of 10,000 dollars.

When I returned, I was readmitted thankfully, and given one semester to finish paying for school.

I've been struggling to pay that amount back alone, but through veteran benefits, and independent status aid through FAFSA and stuff, I was able to pay for this semester and reduce my amount to 6,500.

I am not allowed to apply for classes until I pay the school off, and they denied an extension or payment plans on the amount I owe.

I have to pay that amount in full.

I've tried pulling a Sallie Mae loan, and since the amount of money I need is for a period over a year ago, I was denied.

The period of time before/when I was deployed ruined my credit score. 

I've applied for several loans through multiple banks, and got denied. I even asked my father to co-sign, and was denied as well. Probably because the divorce really messed his credit score up as well.

The VA, the Vererans Service Office, the Corps of Cadets, and any other resource on campus has told me a conglomerate of responses to include, we can't help you, we've given you all we can help, and good luck, you're on your own, essentially.

I have until the 15th of January to pay them back, so I can continue to attend A&amp;M. 

I feel it's super shitty that A&amp;M claims to help their own, especially military veterans, and I have yet to see any of that.

I'm struggling, and I've never been great at asking for help, especially handouts, but I'm swallowing my pride, and asking for advice, or any ideas. Good ideas. 

In summary, loans haven't worked, my so-called veteran benefits and resources have failed and have been exhausted, federal loans and aid has been exhausted, and my family is poor/divorced, so I will not ask them. My university has failed to aid and assist me. I owe 6,500.00

So, anyone got anything? 

Also. I don't want to leave this school. I've got a plan that won't allow me to be out of school any longer. I've invested too much already. A degree from this school is one of my life goals. Especially because I'm in line to commission from this school as well. The ROTC's can't offer me a scholarship yet either. Not that it would help.

This most recent fall semester, I came to the conclusion that I no longer wanted to study what I was majoring in, and that I needed to change. I was told by my academic advisor that classes that did not apply to my new major could be ""lined-out"" so that they were not calculated to my GPA.

At my school, a GPA under a 2.0 is grounds for taking away financial aid. Students must also maintain a completion rate of 75% of classes.

Because I was told that classes would be ""lined-out"", I decided that I would only go to the classes that would transfer over next semester (2 of 5 classes that I was taking this recent semester). I ended up getting an A in the classes that would transfer over, but F's in the classes I did not attend (who woulda thought?).

Now, because of those F's, I have a 68% completion rate. My GPA with lined out classes will be a 2.25. So, I am halfway in good standing.

I called my school, and my appeal for getting financial aid back was denied. I have to pay $28,620 now for the spring semester/ until I get my completion rate over 75%.

I just plain can't afford that. My father is a Firefighter/ owns his own small business on the side, and my mother works as a receptionist at a car dealership. They are also in the middle of a really nasty divorce, so they can't really help me at all.

As far as I can see, I'm fucked, and I don't know what to do to fix it. I guess if any of you beautiful people have any advice, I'd take it. Thanks.

So far I have not had to take out loans because I have prepaid college credits and have worked fulltime since I was 18. University is harder than community college was and I see I cannot continue working like this and hope to do well. I am very scared of student loans. Advice please!

......

So I am currently a junior level psychology student and have realized I can't do fulltime work and hope to do well in University (transferred after I got my AA). While I love art and writing, my deepest desire has always been to be in the mental health field, perhaps as a therapist or counselor but I want to be able to have freedom within the field to change my job in case I get burnt out as a therapist, since many people do. I am serious about going to grad school, after many years of considering the pros and cons. So I want to do AWESOME now that I'm at University. I want to do well in my classes, hopefully get a part time job or internship related to mental health, join clubs and organizations (I have no interest in going Greek though) and I want to make it into the psychology honors society, as I think it would be good to have these experiences in my background and to network with others who will be in my field. 

But I am terrified of taking out student loans (and many tell me, with good reason). My roommate currently has $30,000 in debt after he graduated, and seems very calm about it, and has told me most people at college have to take out loans. But if I am looking at grad school, I know that I'm going to have to take out loans in the future too, and the idea of all this debt is overwhelming. If I can make it through undergrad without going to debt, I would feel much better about taking out loans for grad school. I don't know how these kids can be so calm about these huge piles of debt and I feel that they don't look at the reality of how much money that is and that it will probably be more to pay back with interest. I don't want loans to ruin my life, and have read many stories where they did ruin the person's life.

All that being said, I always file my FAFSA. I have not gotten very much at all from FAFSA in the past, usually only about $1000 - $1500, due to my age, my job, my grandparents income (they legally adopted me as a baby), etc. This month my grandpa retired meaning that both of my grandparents are now retired, and they cannot help me at all monetarily and I wouldn't want them to anyway. I also quit my job due to a bunch of personal health issues and life problems I have been going through that I won't go into, but that job sucked my happiness from me, and I am glad I quit. FAFSA has gotten me only $1500 for the upcoming spring semester even though I filed as an independent (not sure I did this properly, as I did have to give my grandparents income information), and with my own savings and the possibility of a part time job (as long as it does not mess with my grades) I think I can make it through this semester. But I need a financial plan for the semesters after that, I definitely want to take summer courses, and I am not sure that the Prepaid college program is going to stretch all the way to the end of undergrad because I wasted some of the credits as a freshman.

I have wondered if I would be able to get any disability financial aid since I am diagnosed Bipolar and have several years history of medical visits, one baker act, and it definitely effects my quality of life and ability to do well in school. I have researched some mental health scholarships and do plan on applying. I have not filed for any kind of disability with the government and am not sure if that's the right thing to do.

I am most concerned with the FAFSA. I feel like I have not been filing it true to my situation and that is why I receive so little aid. Also since all of these income changes happened at the end of this year, when I file in January, it's going to show that my grandparents and I had an income and thus result in a higher EFC. I want to sit with someone knowledgeable about the FAFSA, tell them my situation and see if they'll babystep me through the one I have to file in January, but I don't know who to turn to, as the financial aid office at my university can be difficult to deal with.

I have promised myself to see this degree through and take out loans if I have to, but I definitely don't want to do that. Can you guys give me any advice or information that might help me?

Each has its pros and cons, but I have a hard time actually choosing one and I find it difficult to get a feel for the schools based solely on their respective websites. 

* Michigan seems to be the most renowned of the colleges, and I could certainly cope with the weather.

* I find it most difficult to get a grasp on Illinois. 

* Texas also seems like a solid choice, with the bonus of still living in a major city and a warmer climate. 

* I've heard good things about CalPoly from my international exchange coordinator. My dad is not so subtly urging me to pick this college, as ""California is more liberal, kinda like Europe"". 

* Rose Hulman probably interests me the most at the moment and it is the most unique of all my options. What worries me however, is how well-known the school is to outsiders/grad. school admissions. I can't seem to find any international rankings of the school online.

So I've posted on here before about how I've been wrestling with my mental health this semester and how shit I am at college. Well, I'm here to tell you a story. A story about chemistry.

I should preface that I'm doing decently well in all my classes except fuckin chemistry. Since midterms, I've completely lost my confidence and motivation in that class and I haven't gone for basically any of second half of semester. I mean, I went there physically, but didn't take any notes, didn't pay attention, basically just sat there and hoped to absorb the info via osmosis or something. It did not work.

I always just figured I'd teach myself in the last few weeks of school but I guess I just let time get away from me and I got so caught up worrying about Christmas and finishing all these assignments and stressing out about life in general that the exam (which is a week from today) just kinda snuck up on me. 

I'm already failing so I'd have to pull a pretty good mark to pass at this point, which is never going to happen because I have no idea what we've even done this half of the semester, let alone how to do it (it's all calculations). When I go to write this exam, I will literally be randomly guessing on every single question, and believe me I'm not exaggerating. 

Anyway...I obviously know that I have no one to blame but myself, so I don't need the lecture. I can't even blame it all on my mental illness, a lot of it (most of it) was just poor time management and lack of discipline. But I'm feeling pretty shit right now nonetheless.

Like I said, please spare me the lecture. I just want to hear from some other people who have failed courses in college? What lead to failing? How did you deal with it afterwords? How did you clean up the mess? I'm interested in hearing your story.

Not something to live off of but just to pay the bills and have some fun. At this time I thought about going to dental school for orthodontics but decided it was really not for me. 

My parents never went to college, first generation here. it was difficult for me to figure out to do after high school. My mom pushed me to go to college right after high school but I had other ideas. I applied to college anyway and failed many classes. I quit. They were not happy. I took time off to work and travel. Came back to school did much better. School was basically off and on for me due to money and FAFSA not wanting to provide money for me because my parents ""made too much"" for this household.  It wasn't until my brother started college that I got some financial aid but even that was not enough.

Now I'm back in school and especially with my job with the hospital (not a clinical setting but an office setting/insurance). While it is great my work schedule is fixed, it can be a problem when it is the new quarter and the classes don't work with my work schedule. Work is low stress with no overtime but there are times when I leave work where I can't shut off my mind thinking about work. And sometimes it sucks getting off work at 7PM when the tutoring center is closed and classmates rarely have energy to study with me at that hour.

While I know it is possible to finish school and work full time I would definitely like to be able to volunteer or shadow MDs or PAs and get some experience in hopes of applying to med or PA school. I wish to be able to find free time to go to meetups to learn Spanish, go climbing or be able to socialize. Unfortunately meetups and volunteering/shadowing are on weekdays - the days I need to use to study. Sometimes it gets stressful being inside. I never get to soak up the sun and I have SAD and I've been very sedentary. I feel low on energy after work where I feel the ""after work blues"" - where I plan what I'm going to do after work like meet for food with a friend but I always end up bailing and probably due to winter it contributes to me bailing a lot.  I study but I'm also not very diligent and it takes full force will to get me to do it. 

It's just so damn hard to concentrate or stay motivated. And I really do not want to fail classes. I try to save money and not be in debt. I've never pulled out loans and paid for school out of pocket for the most of it. I try to never go out and eat and always bring my own food. Sometimes I wish for adderall, I know I'm just looking for an easy way out.

I've spoken with professors about this but most of the time it's ""focus on one thing."" Almost sounds like quit work and just stay in school and take just one class a quarter. While that sounds great I still have rent, gas money, food, car insurance, etc. to pay for. I think maybe I am spread too thin. I have to many interests and I don't know how to stop some times. I want to be able to relax by playing cello or piano as well but if I do that, that means I have to put studying up in the back burner. Like if I took a break to play piano I might end up playing for hours and lose track of time.

Not sure if this means anything but 

My commute to school and work is basically like this and can change up:
option 1: Drive to work. Park. Take public transportation to school bright and early. Finish school and take public transportation back to work. Finish work. Go back to school to study or stay at work and study. Takes about 45mins

option 2: Ride bike to school. takes about an hour to an hour and 30 minutes depending on how fast I want to ride. This time let’s me relax a lot. Which is great but also time consuming. Then ride to work which takes about 20 minutes. but then I have to ride my bike home at night at about 7PM. Riding a bike is nice but I’m also dang hungry all the time. while I do bring my own lunch and have extra food at my desk at work I am a bottomless pit. 

option 3. Drive to school. deal with paying for parking and might even have to drive around for a while to look for parking which is annoying. Drive to work then also end up having to deal with some traffic. then also parking at work at the hospital is atrocious. Get done with work and try to do homework. 

Basically my life is up at 6AM, try to dress myself (usually I work my work clothes anyway but there are days I wish I could just wear sweatpants), get to school by 7 (i try to give myself some time in case of a flat if I am riding my bike or traffic if I am driving), out of school by 10, get to work by 1030am, off work at 7pm then study until 11pm. Repeat.

797,yliaste,1448933140,/r/college/comments/3uxojw/failed_3_semesters_of_college_due_to_depression/,"Hello Reddit, I need your advice.

Two years ago I fell into a quite deep state of depression, so I dropped out of college, only to come back and failed all my classes because I couldn't find the strength in me to get out of bed in the morning to go to school. I was always either crying or sleeping all day, and lying awake at night staring at the ceiling and cry some more. However I didn't manage to drop out in time so the ugly grades stayed in my transcript. The same thing happened the next semester, and the semester after that. I was in a dark place.

I'm doing better now because I had help from my friends (god bless them, by the way). I found a job, and I went back to school again and am doing quite good. I tried to apply to a full-time program next semester but got rejected because of my failures in the past. My R-Score (the equivalent of a GPA) is ridiculously low because of that. I know I can raise it quite a bit with this semester's grades, but I can't apply until next year. I'm already 20 years old and I don't want to waste any more time. 

Moreover, I'm only allowed 3 free consecutive semesters of part-time studies. After that, I'd have to pay the full fee for my classes. I could apply to another college so that it'd be free, but it'd be hard adjusting.

What should I do? Is it possible to change what's written on my transcript or is it too late? I'm planning to get into Computer Science in University but I honestly don't know if I can make it.

799,ziztark,1448517379,/r/college/comments/3ubbme/i_have_a_small_debt_with_a_school_i_never_went_to/,"First of all, by debt I mean about $250, it's not really a big deal but I'm worried of what might happen if I don't pay the bill.

So, here's the deal. Last year I applied to a bunch of colleges, ended up choosing one and paying all the deposits, reserved a spot on the dorms, etc...

For personal reasons I was not able to attend college, so I let them know by email that I would not be attending, and my admission and scholarship were both cancelled. I assumed this would cut all ties with the school. By the way, I did this back in July, before classes or orientation began, so I never even touched school grounds.

The $250 charge comes from a ""no show fee"" from the residential deparment. They say that because I didn't let them know specifically that I wouldn't be attending I have to pay this fee, despite the fact that other departments had no problem with it.

I'm very reluctant to pay this fee. I already had paid a deposit for the room, and it feels stupid to me that I'm being charged because I didn't email every single department in the school separately. I've tried to get them to drop the charge, but they won't. 

So now I'm wondering if anything would happen if I just didn't pay it. I have no plans to attend, or have any interaction with this college whatsoever. I never attended or enrolled, so they can't put a hold on anything.

If I don't pay, will this keep me from getting into a different college? Will the debt come back to bite me in the ass? Can they pursue it legally or something?

I guess, what's the worst case scenario here?

I figure best case scenario they just don't care and I go on living life normally forever. But I'm worried that this debt might keep me from graduating at another college or something. Does anyone have any experience with things like this?

800,seveer4444,1448139651,/r/college/comments/3tqhvb/i_need_advice_on_how_to_finish_my_degree/,"In 2008 I graduated High School and ended up getting a large scholarship to the school of my choice; that scholarship lasted for the majority of my time there but with the rising tuition I soon found myself in a predicament where I had to pay out of pocket for school/use federal and private loans. At the time that wasn't too bad I maintained a job while I was going to school so that I could pay for tuition, commuting fees, and supplies.

Come senior year, I get ready to apply for graduation and I find out that I do technically have enough credits to graduate, but they weren't dispersed right across my degree audit; was missing 9 credits in liberal arts electives. This was due to an oversight from the registration official I worked with to get my class schedules each year. (Unfortunately she is assigned to me because of my last name; I can't meet with the other officials.)

So I book an appointment to try to get it figured out. I asked the registrar if she would allow me to take the remaining credits at a community college; but the registrar said that I would have to take my last semester at the institution or I would not be eligible to graduate. The classes at my school are very expensive so as of right now I've been able to take 1 class and I'm currently paying it off. So I have 6 lib arts left; I did make another appointment to speak with them and was able to work out a deal to do 1 class at a Community college and then take the final class at the institution.

My problem lies with the fact that right now I'm trying to pay on my loans which have accrued a lot of interest and also trying to finish paying off my institution. At the rate I'm going that will be in another 3 years. A lot of my high school friends have been put in similar situations but were able to get jobs because they were working in industries where you don't necessarily need a degree. But I went into an industry where a degree is usually mandatory. So in the mean time I've been working jobs that don't require a degree and are low paying. I've been trying to find something better but it's hard, I've been applying all over the place but nothing fruitful. I've applied at some blue collar jobs as well, but because I'm a very small statured person and thin frail looking person, those jobs are not keen to hire me.

The real problem arises with the fact that I've had several job offers that would have given me an actual living wage where I could pay on everything and be working in the field that I studied; but upon learning that I don't quite have my degree I was rejected. I just got a call from Nissan last week, they were very very interested in hiring me. I was brought in for the interview and they were ready to offer me the job, but then we got to the part where I don't have a degree and I was turned away. The HR manager said if I got my degree in the next few months they'd give me the position.
I have looked/applied for scholarships, and grants but to no avail. I can't take out any federal loans and will not take out any private loans because I have enough of those to last me a lifetime.
I'm between a rock and and hard place, I can't get a better job because I don't have my degree, and I can't get my degree because I don't have a better job.

I am almost at the finish line and I'm stuck in place.
Does anyone have any advice on what I can do to get these last 6 credits quickly and earn my degree; or know of any other options available to me.?

Anyway: 

1) treat college as a job recruiting ground--every department connection (do you have an adjunt that might have a sweet internship/volunteering recommendation)?, every friend in your major. It really is who you can turn to down the line and say, I need a job.

2) The horrible thing is literally every entry level job these days seems to expect college students to learn all the skills one might need for a mid level job. 

There are some common things--stuff you'll learn writing for your papers, but....know more than that. If you can learn Quickbooks (big plus in entry level office jobs in any major company) for basic accounting, do it. If you can learn Adobe Creative Suite for a school paper, do it. If you can write for ANYONE, in any recreational respect--group blog, online school newspaper, personal tumblr of reviews, TED Talks--do so. 

I am applying for receptionist jobs now but the major employers hiring want creative types with experience. 

Go on Craigslist and really take a look at the internships and the software asked for the skills....now.

3) Don't put off going to your career services office.

I'm very lucky, that's one thing my school got right. 

It takes four years to build up basic computer skills, poise to get through an interview, write a good resume tailored to a specific job, get used to the grind of writing cover letters, and develop transferable skills that will get you in the day to data entry/analysis, event planning, coordinating with clients...all of which can be tailored across different fields into jobs to keep a roof over your head. 

I wish someone had taken me by the hand and warned me a decade ago,  but I was forced into graduate school for a field I had zero interest in that was highly specialized and horrifically underpaid. 

I would not go to grad school unless you MUST--I'm sure those of you in the medical or engineering fields have to. It's a huge waste of money and physical energy. Be very careful about the program you choose and their requirements to graduate (the fieldwork, the reviews of professors, the number of credits assigned to ""x"" number of work). I've seen it all. Try to get as high a gpa as you can now based on the same criteria and if you can't get into a graduate school with good accrediation and a strong career placement for you field...RUN. Really, just fucking run in the other direction. Look into another route. Get your GPA up some other way. 

See college as the first step feeding up the ladder into employment. 

The sad thing is it's wonderful and you're learning how to write and think as a community but employers give fuckall about giving you that experience in the future until you can demonstrate basic, technical use to them, generating content (again--even for a basic receptionists or data entry job for an industry that specifies they only need a receptionist, but interviewed as if they would only hire someone with 5 years experience performing the same content creation tasks they did) or demonstrating office experience. 


You need to have all these skills for jobs that  might pay $13/hour.

Get it now, even if it's unfair you should be obligated to treat this time as job training time too.

P.S. You can totally count on campus jobs or that 3 month internship/stint. ",college,A recommendation to college grads who hope to be employed upon graduation. Don't waste this time.

In elementary school, my mother hid my grades from me. How could I improve if I didn't know how horrible I was doing? I passed with a D in almost everything. Getting a C or B was something for me to be proud of. I have horrible work ethic. I'm just happy I have a job and am doing good in that. Anyway, I digress. I dropped out of high school, spent the rest of the winter participating in out-patient (where suicidal kids go who just complain about wanting to die but don't actually attempt to) and claiming I was going to be a tattoo artist and live off that (On another note, I'm an artist and a musician and want to go to Columbia in Chicago, IL). I' moving very slowly in college right now, taking 1 or 2 classes a semester. Yea. Just reading that to myself, my heart dropped into my stomach. The only thing fortunate for me right now is the fact that the rest of my career here at community college, I'll be taking art classes. I DO NOT have the choice to fuck those up. This is my career we're talking about. As far as Columbia goes, there are no prerequisites. Of course having a portfolio is going to help a bunch - and that's where art classes come in. I want to take 4 a semester but I know I can't do it so I'll take 3. This is my one and only salvation. If I can just do really good in these classes that will benefit my future and then get the fuck out of here and get accepted, I'll be a VERY happy man. But there are two thoughts that PLAGUE my mind, day in and day out. 
1. If I fail these two classes, will my parents refuse to pay for anymore classes
2. If my parents won't pay for my classes, financial aid won't pay for them because of my recent grades.
1 + 2 = No successful future in sight, which in turn equals probable game over.

I don't believe long distance relationships work but we've been together for two years now and love each other very much. I really hope the distance won't get the better of us. So yea.

I'd taken college courses full time for two years before hand and I jumped straight into the hard stuff, thinking that I'd be fine, since I'd been fine in the past taking classes at a Tier 2 university while having the support of my family and not living hundreds of miles away. 

So anyway, that didn't happen. Right now I'm looking at getting a single A, a B, a C in a class I promised myself I'd do well in , and a D or F in another. The class I'm potentially failing is Calc 2. I sort of expected that one to give me trouble, but not failing. I could still get a C, but I see little point in trying to, since I'm using forgiveness on that course since I need higher than a C in it to get into my major anyway. 

However, this is what really got me. I'm a chemical engineering major who has also entertained chemistry. I still haven't quite figured that out yet, *especially* now. I worked in an organic chemistry lab for a year and fell in love with it. I was mentored by an organic chemist. Basically, I was sure I had the class on lock. 

My first exam went well. I got a B. I've been above average on all my quizzes. I studied my ass off for the second midterm. 

...I got a low D. I don't even understand how. When I looked over the exam with my TA (who graded it), he even said that I got pretty much everything right and that the rubric was extremely nitpicky. He's actually going to look it over and see if I could get more points, since he knows that I do well otherwise and participate avidly in the class. 

But a good chemist doesn't make stupid mistakes. A good student doesn't fail Calc 2. I'm doing absolutely devastating and it was only halfway through the semester that I really learned how to actually study, and even then, it doesn't always pay off. I can't handle it. I went to my adviser today and bawled my eyes out because, in comparison to my peers, I just can't keep up anymore, and this was never a problem in the past. I'm even considering dropping out and taking up a trade, even though I'm terrible at manual labor. I guess I'm terrible at everything. 

How do you bounce back? How can I recover from this? I know how to study now. I know now that tests can be damn cutthroat. But none of *that* knowledge helps me if I'm just a fucking idiot.

804,xxyyaa,1447902513,/r/college/comments/3tdt5i/disaffiliating_from_fraternity/,"Hey everyone. So I recently became a brother at a fraternity at my school out West. I'm a 2nd year, and before being a pledge, life at my school was woefully boring, even during the summer at a study abroad program. This is mainly because at the school I'm at now, social life is really based on Greek life. Understandably, when I got my bid from my top choice fraternity, I was teeming with excitement, and was ready to finally make the most of my time at my school. As a recent brother though, much of that excitement has waned. We don't have much money to do big things at our house (because we're 6 years old, started in 2009), which I've always been okay with, but I feel like we should make more of an effort to get more involved on campus and have slightly more parties. The other issue is that I'm not sure if the chapter appreciates having me around. A couple of brothers were poaching my date at semi-formal, and although I want to get involved with leadership, I've been consistently passed up for everything even with good ideas (the rest of my pledge class has actually done quite well with this). Also, I never expected to be best friends with everyone in the chapter, but I feel like I'm best friends with no one, friends with some, acquaintances with many others. I harbor no ill will toward any of these guys, because they've been very good to us as pledges (With that said, I won't reveal my university or chapter). I've realized that the problem likely lies with me: I may not be that good of a fit for these guys as I and they thought at the beginning. And so, this has brought me to the point of considering disaffiliation. Dues are a little over $1000, and it would feel morally and fiscally wrong to pay if I can't connect with the chapter well enough.

If I leave though, I won't enjoy the rest of my time at this school very much, as it can be very boring and cause lots of depression in some people. I have friends from freshman year, through organizations, and through classes outside the chapter whom I could try to keep up with, but my social life would be quite unenviable. On the other hand, I don't want to keep paying dues if nothing will come of it.

I'm just looking for some guidance here. My big brother has been good to me so far, but I don't want to pester him with this idea. Like I said, I'll give no identifying information, because this chapter has good people, and the problem likely lies with me.

Edit: Also I may have been expecting too much (solid social life, parties, girls, leadership) from the fraternity, and maybe this is the source of my disappointment.

The only reason I'm at this University right now is because my job pays for half of my tuition, my federal loan pays for the other half, and I'm not required to live on campus so I can pay my own rent. I'm working 35-40 hour weeks and am in class 15 a week right now. I know what you guys are thinking... this kid needs to quit being a little bitch and do what he has to do to get his degree. However, I'm a become more and more enticed by my other option at UD every day. 

* I always wanted to join ROTC and sign with the military but, stupidly, I got away from that dream my senior year due to a girlfriend. I'm still with that girlfriend, and am very happy with her, but I'm not happy with my life and where it's going right now. I think of joining every day... it's always what I've wanted to do. Plus, it'd pay for my college, and I'd get to go to the college of my choice. I've talked with representatives at UD, and they told me there's a solid chance of them being able to sign me and gain the full three-year scholarship totaling 99,000 dollars plus another 40,000 dollars from UD to cover my room and board, meal plan, and laptop/book grant (As long as I do well in my interview process both with UD and the US Army). I think if i really buckle down academically the rest of this semester / next semester, I can get that scholarship.


Honestly, I don't really know. I just read my post, and it seems like the obvious choice is to transfer, but I still just feel so hesitant. Has anybody else been in a similar situation, or have any advice at all?

808,rhackle,1446231092,/r/college/comments/3qvh1k/4th_year_in_college_i_feel_like_im_just_burning/,"So I have a bit of a complicated college experience.  I was at the top of my class in HS.  I decided to go to a top engineering school out of state to major in Nuclear Engineering.  I did not fit in at all on campus, and got hit by depression pretty hard.  I transferred out after 3 semesters back home to a local CC b/c my GPA was a 1.xx so I couldn't get into anywhere decent.

After 1 year, I got my AA then worked a soul-draining retail job fro a semester until one of the state uni's accepted me.  I changed my major to chemistry because engineering would take another 3 years due to lack of related courses at the CC.  

I'm going through the motions now..... and I just feel like I'm wasting my time.  My prior academic history will bar me from any grad programs or research.  The job market from a BS in Chemistry is tragic from what I've read and heard from friends going through it right now.  $12-13hr if your lucky.... requiring 2 years relevant experience.  I have a huge amount of loans from paying OOS for 3 semesters, so I need something better than that if I want to actually live life not in my parents basement.  

I don't know what to do anymore. I really like chemistry and the perspective it gives you on the world. I have 3 semester left to finish up Chemistry, and I have too many credits to change majors without paying the penalty for going over the credit cap. I like coding so I'm thinking about picking up a CS minor to be a little more marketable.... but at this point I feel like I'm in school just to be doing something, not because I want to be here. I'm not sure if I want to incur more debt if I don't see the payoff.  

Sometimes I think about just dropping everything and fleeing to South America where my debt can't follow me.  I've also thought about cutting my losses and picking up a trade like welding since the pay seems to be better than many other jobs that are available in science/tech fields.  I just feel like I don't have many options that end well for me.  Anyone have any insight or go through something similar?",college,4th year in college.....

809,_StraightUpLazy_,1446011532,/r/college/comments/3qiy9g/a_passionate_email_is_disapointing_even_the_right/,"**Friend received an email from his physics prof last week, thought I would share it with you guys.**
 
**Is 'Disapointing' even the right word?**
 
 
So I throw aside things in my life I need to do, work through 3AM for a few days to write these notes for you, set up HW problems so that you can get yourself some good hard practice using those notes, and then log in to MasteringPhysics on Monday morning to see what?
 
-- that a mere 21.7% of the class have attempted more than 2 for-credit problems.
 
Ofcourse some (in that 21.7%) have almost finished the HW including some with below average score on the first exam. I am very happy to see that. But I have lost my motivation to ""work ON the masses"" (it's a pun).
 
I have several things with you to share, several emails from you folks. Sadly I'vent had the time to reply to them properly but I'll do so someday.
 
But one email asked me a question and I think an earlier answer to that might have helped some.
 
The situation is something like this -- Last weekend the person returned from their weekend trip to home and emailed me on late Sunday night --
 
""Is it true that the HW is due in 3 days""?
 
Answer: Yes. But it was not due FOR 3 days. HW could end up being due in an hour, if you start it with 1 hour to go.
 
Folks, I spent my entire lecture on Day 1 telling you what to do and not to do, to succeed in this class. I told you weekend is not your party time; not the least in your first semester. If your friends, parents, whoever you are 'hanging out' over the weekend are not asking you whether you are on board with your assignments in your first semester, they are distracting you. If they truly care for you and don't want to see you break down next semester when you will fail to get into your desired major, then they should work to stop distracting you and YOU should work to stop getting distracted. If you want to do well, then watch out. It is one thing to go home but another thing to take that time 'off' from serious catching up.
 
It is appalling enough that I had to spend one full 75 minutes preparing you how to study in college. Your teachers in school and your parents should have done that and not 'let you loose' with that irritating 'do what you want' message leaving you wandering aimlessly not knowing how to cope with college.
 
What is worse is that they and your new found friends are continuing to distract you. I bet even now they are telling you something like 'All Work and No Play Makes Jack a Dull Boy'....to conclude what? Let's play, to hell with work? Let me tell you that ""All work and No play"" does NOT mean let's do all play and no work. Get your English right.
 
They (and you) need to change that to 'All Play and No Work Gets Jack a Dull Career'. Strike a balance. Extreme actions lead to catastrophe.
 
Few days back I met one of you who has badly failed (not just a low score, but badly failed) one of the easiest 218 exams. We spoke at length for quite sometime on what changes to bring about. Other issues aside, I asked if they go to these games.
 
Me: What time do you stop studying on Saturday?
They: Around 12:30pm Sat
Me: When do you start studying again?
They: around 2:30 pm on Sunday
Give or take a few hours but a good chunk of 24 hrs is wasted.
 
Thereafter they asked 'Can I please go to the BAMA game?' Why? Their parents are coming! I would have felt a lot happier if their parents had asked how much they scored on their first midterms (all classes) and mentored them on how to study (another example of a parent is coming below). Instead, how about waste another 24 hours for a 3 hour game that has an actual run time of 1 hour...Sigh. I feel sad for some of you.
 
Let me tell you that this student has not done a SINGLE HW problem (not even a practice one) from the current HW. I hope they will let their parents know their score on the 2nd midterm and get a pat on the back as well.
 
And ofcourse this person isn't the only one. I met a few others last week, who despite our chat has not done a SINGLE HW problem but I am sure had enough time to spend at 'the game'.
 
Another parent: Last semester I met one of my former students (she got an A in my class and at this point of our meeting she is NOT in my class) in the main floor. It was 8pm. She had brought her parents into the building to show them around campus. She introduced me to her parents. We had a nice chat and then she tells me this:
 
""Professor, my parents have come in to town for the game tomorrow and has even bought tickets for me. I am unable to convince them why I should not be going to this game cause I have a midterm on Monday"".
 
This is how BAD some parents are. But at the same time, this is also the spirit a real ""A"" has. You need to develop an attitude like hers. Learn to resist temptation, take responsibility of your actions and your life and pay heed when a professor (likely the only professor) sends you mails like these. Pinch yourself nice and hard and wake up from your dream world. Real world is different.
 
Want to watch the game? Who says no? I ddin't. Turn on that TV and watch it for 3 hours. Then go back to studying. You can't waste your weekend on one stupid game be it whatever game.
 
I told you on day 1, this class needs 17 hours of your time PER week for the average student to get an average grade. Not to get your A. If you ignored it, don't cry later. If you are going to take your weekends 'off' then find those 17 hours on the other 5 weekdays just for this class. i.e. 3.5 hours per weekday just for this class. Can't fit so many hours per day on weekdays? Then don't take your weekends off. Sleep, rest, listen to relaxing music and study if you want to get into your desired major.
 
Throw away all your enrollments in this organization, that organziation, this fraternity, that sorority, VP of this, CEO of that. No body will give a damn to any of these if you don't get into your major. 'Extra curricular' means extra to a GOOD curricular achievement. Fix the later first. There is plenty of time in your undergraduate career for all your 'extra' things. Does it have to be in your first semester when you are trying to learn how to cope with pressure and classes and homeowork?
 
For the last time, once again -- Getting into these majors is fiercely competitve. More challenging than going to Hell. Students have been denied application (let alone admission) because they fell short by a GPA of 0.04 (I know one case personally). Good luck to you!
 
Lastly, this mail is my last mail of concern to you. I am not 'mad at you' because you haven't started the HW. I won't be mad at you either if you don't do the HW. Do or don't, ace the exams and make sure you have enough points on other things to get your grade. But let me tell you this -- you can get 90% on midterms yet miss the A, because you will perform miserably on my final exam if you don't do my homework and practice problems.
 
It is upto you, how you would achieve your targets. Its your life, your career and will soon be your increasing debt as you end up delaying your graduation. Make sure to save your Aggie tickets and your A+ passes so that you can place them as stickers on your debt portfolio. Afterall, you should be able to connect the right 'cause' to the observed 'effect'.
 
Let the test average on exam 2 be 30. I promise you one thing, I won't curve it even if every other professor curves. I am not going to tell you 'its ok if you got 30, let's just call it 50'. No, you get 30, you are living with it. If in the real world, after you mess up at work if your boss could come to you and say 'I'm sorry you messed up, how about I give you a raise?"" then maybe such an expectation would make sense. But such doesn't happen and so the very thought of making a 30 a 50 hurts my brain. I am not doing it.
 
 
All the best to all of you. I've had enough 'Brain Damage'.

My parents said if I don't pass all my classes with A/B this semester they will not pay for college next semester.
I can't motivate myself to do college. The idea of having a degree excites me, and learning excites me, but studying and doing homework is basically torture for me. I'm the least disciplined person I know and basically got through high school because my teachers liked my personality, and recognized my intelligence. However despite my intelligence college is a daily struggle for me. I play video games to forget the pain and stress of doing homework.

Should I take a break from college?  I am a sophomore.

**Money**

Here's the big one.  I'm a little worked up right now, so if something doesn't make sense, just ask.  My parents are in a bad financial situation and can't afford to help me at all with college.  So far, I have payed for 2 full semesters out of pocket, and my grandparents have paid for 1.  The amount of money that I have in my savings right now, is about the exact amount that I would pay for next semester.  If I stay after this semester, I will have *absolutely*  no money in my bank account.  I've tried lowering my work load over the summer, where I had a job, and it was terrible.  I ended up withdrawing from the class because my job was way too much.  But I NEEDED a job in order to go to school this semester.  

**Family**

I have a feeling some of you will tell me not to worry about my Family, but I can't help it.  Over the past two years, my parents have been in a crazy financial situation.  My mom is a stay at home mom who takes care of my baby brother with his condition, and my dad works 3 jobs to get food on the table.  About a month ago my parents have filed for bankruptcy, and as far as I know it is becoming a little bit better.  But nothing worries me more than seeing my mom upset all the time, and never seeing my dad because he's working all the time. 
This, and a couple family deaths that happened right at the beginning of the semester has seriously thrown me off track.

**Grades/Social Life** 

Last year, freshman year, was the best time I had in my entire life.  My grades weren't good, usually just barely passing a class with a C, but I had met a lot of amazing people.  This year is different though.  Ever since the first day of school I have been stressed over money problems, family, and my classes are getting tougher.  I never see any of my friends from last year.  I feel depressed so I just stay in my room most of the time.  When I force myself to go out and be social, I just get overly self conscious and feel like a buzzkill to everyone around me.  At the beginning of the year, I was worried because the professors that I was stuck with had *horrible* reviews.  And boy were they right.  I'm not learning anything with so much on my mind, and I am really rethinking my major (Mech E).  


I'm sorry if a lot of this sounds scattered, there's just a lot on my mind.  I could write so much more but I really need to stop where i'm at.  I would really appreciate another opinion.  The counselors/academic advisors at my school are not very good, and make it obvious that they are only helping because it's their job.  I have not told anyone about my possible decision.  But I really think a break from college would benefit me. ",college,Thinking about Taking a Break from College?

Dealing with LANs for businesses and managing their IT infrastructure. I don't have a passion for this line of work, I view it as a big chore... and I don't see myself doing it as a career.

The only reason I entered the IT Program was because my Dad wants me to be this 1337 H4xx0rsz. Having hacked before, I find it very boring and child's play. So what if I can use SQL Injection to get the names of employees in a company? It's silly too because laws are so tight I can't do anything with the knowledge I'm learning without getting punished for it in some form.

I originally wanted to enter into the welding program because I welded in highschool and absolutely loved it... and welders get payed about $20+ where I live. It's simple work, with great pay, and it makes you feel good knowing whatever you do at the job, you're putting something out there in the world. 

Not so with the virtual realm. I have learned that IT is incredibly complicated, so much so it's intimidating. There are people who know a lot, who spend wakeless hours learning about the smallest tools. Some people at my college have slipped through the cracks somehow and work as support technicians, despite not knowing crap (I told IT here when my internet went out that I could ping the router, but couldn't ping 8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4 in the CMD. She stared at me like I was speaking in chinese, and asked me to try to go to google.com one 2 different browsers, facepalm). 

Another thing is that I'm concerned about how fast IT moves, it's insane. I took 2 courses that already are out-of-date. I thought it would cap out when I started school (Fall of 2014) but nope, in just a year soo much has changed!

I started Fall of 2014, invested almost 3 semesters into this program and only a semester away from obtaining my technical certificate (I was going for the associates, but GenEds would tac on an extra year), 

One of my good friends is in the Machining program and loves it; he gets to make stuff for his chopper and anything else he fancies. He got himself a job and goes to school part-time now. I wish I could do the stuff he's doing, in fact he's trying to encourage me to do it.

The only reason why I'm still stuck in this program is that a lot of stuff is easy. Real easy. Other stuff is really friggin hard, like rocket surgery hard. Linux Server Administration? No thank you, log and configuration files are not my friend.

I've tried to like this program and I think have given it a fair shot, however I smell s**t all around.

**TLDR: My dad has pumped in about $6000 of his own cash for my schooling, and expects me to be that Ub3rh4xx0r that he dreams me to be. However, I don't give a crap about computers. I hate how complicated they are when you get to the administration front. I hate how the more you learn the less you know. I don't want to go to school for the rest of my life keeping up-to-date.

If I jump ship, all my knowledge will be obsolete if I decide to return. If I stick it through, I may like it, but like I said I smell dog sh** with IT. I have little motivation to learn any more.

813,Anomalous13,1444812179,/r/college/comments/3op7dt/frustrated_with_learning_in_my_calculus_i_class/,"Hi,

I'm into the 2nd month of freshman year of college, and I'm struggling with my Calculus I class. I was wondering if anyone else has had similar experience and if any advice could be given?

-

I'm having a hard time learning the material due to some factors:



* The class is mostly lecture, and 105 minutes in length. (Or 1 hr, 45 min.) The professor lectures for the whole period, and there is hardly any student interaction. I pay attention as best as I can, but at times I can't help but space out or get distracted. Even a 5-10 minute break midway would be helpful.

* The class is mostly just the professor writing down notes literally straight from the textbook, with only one or two examples of problems. At the end of class, he assigns us 40-50 practice problems from a section.                                                                                                   

(This isn't an issue, but the vibe I get from the professor is ""Okay class, here's some notes showing how to do a basic problem. For homework, do these 40 not-so-basic problems."")

- The pacing of the material, both the textbook and the lectures, is incredibly fast. For example, a single chapter covered from the power rule -&gt; implicit differentiation -&gt; linear approximations. This class went over all of that in one week, or four sessions.

(On the other hand, my high school calculus class took one semester to cover the same material, and this material was more spread out. Whilst slower pacing, it was cause of this that I remotely understood what's going on in this current class.)

_

The only grades in this class are from exams. We've had two exams so far, and I've scored 55% on both. This is pretty demoralizing because I felt so confident on the tests. (One red flag I've noticed is that some of the problems on the test I don't even recall seeing on the homework.)

I genuinely enjoy the subject of calculus (and math in general), but the teaching style of the professor and the fast-paced nature of the textbook have left me struggling. If this is how most college classes go, then I have underestimated the learning curve of college.

**And now the question:** How can I adapt to this method of teaching? What can I do to mitigate the situation? Are my study strategies insufficient? I do the homework and read over the material, but my scores say otherwise. What am I doing wrong?

**TLDR;** Class time is somewhat excessive IMO, material coverage is way too fast-paced, professor is only lecturing notes straight from the textbook and hardly covers any specific examples, only grades are from exams. What can I do to better my situation, any advice?",college,"Frustrated with learning in my Calculus I class, any advice?",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3op7dt/frustrated_with_learning_in_my_calculus_i_class/,1444830179.0

First off I'm in my third semester out of a 3 semester remedial math course because I didn't score high enough on the placement. I was doing alright but then I took the same test 4 times and got a 75% every time where you need an 80% to pass. Now I can't take it again until wednesday and I will be a week behind. I was trying to get a week ahead because I'm kind of slow at math. It's just a real downer when you think you know the material only to take an 8 problem test and still technically pass but except you don't. Next is my Java class. I don't get it at all, like math I can at least work out and eventually be alright at, but I have never not understood something this much in my life. I have tried talking to my friends who code, using online resources, and codeacademy but I just don't get it at all. I'm starting to get some of the chapter one and two stuff but we are already moving onto chapter 4. Same goes for my accounting class. I was doing alright but we are moving so fast I feel like I can't keep up. I think Java might be the teacher I have asked her questions but she can never really answer them, or I'm just making excuses. My only class that's going ok is ancient lit surprisingly. 

Then I have to transfer to another college next year and I have no idea how I am going to pay for it. I am trying to buy a car so I can commute (and I need it for work) but that still leaves me with 30k I don't have. I don't get anything from the FAFSA and my parents can't help me with it. I can't work anymore than 20 hours at my job because then I wouldn't have time for homework. 

I really want to get my degree in IT, I have already done an internship and loved it. But I just don't know if I can do it. I will feel like a failure if I can't, I already kind of do. Neither of my parents went to college and I was going to join the police force like my dad but even that you need a college education for and probably military background (something I can't put my parents through, I'm an only child). After that I was going to go to UTI to be a mechanic (love working and fixing things) but turns out that school is a for profit and I don't see a career ladder I can climb in a mechanic career like I can with IT

I just don't know what to do. Should I take a break? I doubt that will make a difference. Should I take less classes? 4 seems like a lot but then I would need to be in school for more time which is more money I don't have. Should I drop programming to free more time for the other classes I know I can pass? 

Not trying to give a pity story here, I'm just trying to lay out the facts in hopes of getting good advice

EDIT: Reading through this post a few times as well as doing some thinking, I am leaning towards dropping the Java class and retaking it another semester. This would free up time to stress less about that class and do other work as well as give me a reason to stay an extra semester and save more money.

I joined the army reserve at 19 and spent the next two years working and going to school. I prioritized work over school and washed out with about 60 hours total. In 2013 I deployed and came back hating the army, it was almost time to reup or get out. I definitely wanted out, I spent my last 6 months working towards joining the coast guard and went to basic in June of 2015. I was sent home on day two because one of my tattoos was out of regulation.

So here I am, working for ok pay but with bad hours. Not fulfilled. Bored. I don't want to waste my potential. 

So I've decided to go back to the same local state school I started at and finish my bachelors. I think I have enough gibill benefits left to make a little money while attending and graduate with no debt, I'll also qualify for the full pell grant so no problems paying for it. 

My issue now is what the hell do I study? I have no interest in engineering or CS. I like helping and working closely with people. I've been really thinking about going all out and shooting for clinical psychology but holy shit is that a long process and a ton of debt. 

I live frugally and I never keep up with the jones so paying my debt really wouldn't be difficult as long as I was steadily employed. Also the idea of just starting my big boy job at 32 is pretty scary.

My parents make 88k a year so we don't get anything from the FAFSA but they can't help me pay for school. I have never asked the details but they have a lot of debt to pay for. We lived with my grandmother most of my childhood and just recently started renting a house a few years ago, if that says anything financially. They help me with food and my dad has given me $2k to find a car this year but aside from that they can't do much (not mad at them or anything). I do have a loan through my college that covers only my 12 credits of courses each semester. 

When I transfer to a university I will most likely be commuting because I can't afford dorms. However the tuition to a school I am looking at is 14k a year I don't even know how I am going to afford that. Will the school give me loans like my CC does? I doubt they will cover everything so do I have to take out a personal bank loan? My bank only allows 25k in loans max and that's if I can even get approved for that. I will most likely have to cut my hours at work and I will be able to cover gas but how do I pay for food, textbooks, and whatever else? 

Guys I'm really worried. I have pretty much accepted I won't be able to go to any nice private school and now I am just trying to find the cheapest state school but even that seems far fetched.

I'm a 26 y/o male (hi!:) and have some questions regarding getting back into school. Originally, I was going to school to become a physical therapist. Figured out I wanted a different direction, and got my EMT license, started working on an ambulance and started working towards my RN. After hurting my back and figuring out that the medical field isn't for me, I've been kinda lost. Thankfully, I started coaching sports at the high school level and feel like I've found my calling. I want to teach and coach at the high school level. So, at the very least, I know what direction I want to go, I just don't know what my first couple of steps should be. 

My situation: the credits I earned at my first school are tied up because I missed student loan payments after injuring my back and not being able to work. Unfortunately I couldn't pay for so long that it went to collections and I can't unlock the credits until I pony up the 10g's+ that I owe my first school. Since I can't work atm, I don't have the money. I probably have around 30 units or so, and I'm not sure all of them would even transfer. Should one of my first steps be talking to a bank to unlock these credits? Like I mentioned earlier, don't have much income right now, so I doubt a bank would be able to help me, but it just seems so stupid of me to just let these credits be worthless until I have 10 g's saved up. No idea what to do here.

Also, my educational direction was originally science, but I want to be a history teacher, so I really don't even know where to start. I already applied and was accepted at my local JC, should I just make an appointment to meet with an academic advisor? I feel like I wouldn't even know what to ask or where to start. Would an academic advisor be able to answer financial aide questions? Would I be a candidate for a lot of financial aide due to my situation? 

**tl;dr** I haven't been in school in a couple years and going back in a completely new direction has me feeling really overwhelmed and kind of paralyzed. Especially with my previously earned credits locked up because I couldn't make my student loan payments. What should my first couple of moves be? Talk to a bank about a loan for my student loans? Talk to an academic advisor? Talk to someone about financial aide? 


Sorry if these are dumb questions, I'm just tired of sitting on my ass and feeling broken from this back injury.

Some background first, I don't have a diagnosis, or anything to go on, yet I have a huge list of symptoms. I've seen numerous doctors over the years, and while a majority agree there is something wrong with me, we can't figure out what. It got so bad, it affected me mentally as well. I switched to a online school early my high school career to try and manage it. I've tried lots of things, and followed lots of advice but physically I haven't gotten better. I did mentally, my anxiety is no way near what it was. I thought I could manage college but I'm not sure.


I've made lots of friends, and I am doing all right in my classes. Except physically I'm not sure. I wake up, struggle to walk to class, struggle to focus in class, and most days I can hardly make it to my third class. I always feel sore and exhausted, after nine hours of sleep, after about 4 hours of class/study time, I come home and take about a four hour nap everyday. And even then I feel exhausted. It's making it hard to focus, and even go to class some days. My mom took me to another set of doctors recently. The first one was a rheumatologist who seemed very nice and even though he didn't think it was related to my anxiety, advised me to see my school counselor. After the 20 blood tests he ordered and a counselor visit, nothing. My blood work only showed I have chronic inflammation and my counselor did not think my anxiety could be affecting anything. I saw a gastroenterologist after that and it was awful. He spent five minutes looking at my symptoms, talked about my anxiety, and told me it was probably my mental state affecting me and left. 

I honestly don't know what to do. Everything at school has been perfect, but I don't know if I can keep doing this. I can't keep going to doctor after doctor to be told nothing. Another thing is I've discovered that it is to much for me to go to school full time and work. Which hurts me because I need to work to pay for college. I've decided to keep going to the school counselor, so I don't start going down the same path I did in high school, and I have a geneticist appointment soon.  For some comparison, they have considered lupus and EDS, yet my results don't show that.

I'm an 18 yr old guy, currently living away from home on my college residence, and for some reason why, whenever I have a lot of homework while sitting in my dorm room, or I'm by myself (at lunch), I start to tear up. (Please don't laugh at me, I'm just have a really good relationship with my parents and sister)


I'm in an Insurance- property and liability course (2 years). Anyways, my home is about 55 miles away from my college, and about (1hr, mostly highway driving). So I talked to my parents and the Course selection helpers, and I set my schedule for Tuesdays to Thursdays (my dad picks me up Thursday night and drops me off on Monday night) except when I have co-op class on Mondays.

I just feel regret for going to a college far from home, but according to statistics, the college closer to my house (that accepted me as well), didn't have a good reputation (Seneca college).  So my parents, extended family and friends all recommended me to take my current colleges acception as they are supposed better.

The problem is that I'm really close to my parents and sister (we tend to spend a lot of time together, always go anywhere together, especially weekends). And I asked my parents if I can drive to school instead. But because of the long 55 mile distance, insurance costs, costs of a car (maybe, might drive parents' car), and general road safety (btw: gas is not an issue $15 both ways maximum per day). 
The drive does not bother as I am the few people in the world that love driving and am very responsible, any kind of driving is good imo, traffic vs. clear anything (also tends to take my mind off of stress)(Never know I maybe would have become a trucker if the pay was still good)

But I feel like I cant handle it, and I always think about home, and its driving me crazy. My parents are trying to tell me to stop worrying cause they said they're feeling horrible that they allowed me to go so far away, but I can't, and I want to take the chance and drive to and back from college everyday next year. Is it a wise decision?
I seriously feel depressed, confused and I don't know what to do.

I really just want to do graphic design or something in that order, and wanted to go to a state college nearby and just commute there. But I can't afford it.

 I'm too scared to take out loans or whatever. I don't even know how that works. I'm pretty sure my parents can't afford to help much with the cost of a state college. I have a job, but definitely not enough to put a dent in the cost. I probably am just rambling for no reason...

But I feel really hopeless about my school situation. School is way too expensive for the middle class...Can't get any financial aid or anything of any sort.

822,SurfboardINMouth,1443581598,/r/college/comments/3mx2ks/questioning_my_passion_and_options/,"It's my fifth year in college. I truly can not seem to find any passion for my degree choice. I started off choosing mechanical engineering at a university and failing my first course that Fall. I was registered for Chem 111 but in reality I was not the best at Chemistry. I changed to Communications and struggled with the reality that I was going to have to fight to get into the very few openings for 300 and 400 level courses at that school. I switched to Computer Science starting Junior year and struggled with the logic of programming. I really only motivate myself with the notion of someday making a lot of money. This is not my true passion and I truly do not know what I am doing in college anymore. Yes I can maintain a relationship at the same time as being enrolled, that's not an issue at all. 

I'm unsure if this belongs in this subreddit but does someone else feel the same way and do they have any advice to pass along? I know I need a degree. I do not want to stay stuck in the service/management industry as I have been since I started work in 2006. I'm 22 and I truly do not have a clue where my passion lies within the framework of college. I am a hard worker but mostly one track minded so once I get stress at work be it a new job and such, I lose track of my courses and lose all ambition. 

I left the university and have been trying my hand at online courses and since there is so little interaction, I'm finding it hard to actually stay focused for more than two weeks before my mind wanders. I've wasted a lot of my Fafsa money and have reached the limit. I'm upset that most of my peers have graduated and I'm still stuck deciding if I care enough about my hobby with fidgeting with tech and software to push through classwork. I'm no fool but I sound like one. 

Regardless, I hope this does not come off as weepy. I truly try my best at everything I do. I feel burnt out after four or so years of aimlessly trying college after being forced into doing so. I wish I had done community college first. I wish I could pick a position and take it to the finish. I feel forced to choose fields that pay a lot simply because they pay a lot. I feel more interest towards trades and communications and humor and social things. Tech is really a hobby. I feel inclined to suffer through the hard majors due to the proposed wealth.

824,DarkDubzs,1442700118,/r/college/comments/3llwkg/borrow_money_from_sister_keep_buying_myself_time/,"So I am in crushed between a rock and a hard place, I have such a sinking feeling of despair right now, I feel like I just want to disappear forever. Well, this is the situation:  
I am a college sophomore, last year I fucked up big time failing a few classes. I knew I was doing horrible, but I didn't think I would have to pay for it like this, not to this magnitude of stress and shit. Man, I wish I could just go back in time and beat the shit out of myself for being a fucking idiot loser. Anyways, this first semester of my second year (it's week 5 now), I've lose financial aid, and have only $180 in my bank account. I have gotten myself into such a web of lies to protect myself and fool my parents, mostly my dad. I have to pay $100 a month on the 15th for a care credit loan for a past surgery, but I can choose to not do payments and I can pay however much more in the future. I also have to pay $30 for my phone bill around the same time to my dad. I also need to come up with $80 to pay for a book I need for math. 

So, I have told my parents that I have $3000 in financial aid money in a different bank account that ""the school made and deposited it into."" Now my dad wants me to withdraw about $500 to my normal bank account since I only have $180 right now. He was trying to get me to do it today, but I may be able to do it tomorrow. This is where I'm at right now and I feel like I'm finally cornered and everything is unraveling, falling apart. I obviously don't have $500 to withdraw. I don't have a job yet, I've been trying, but nobody calla back, so today I'm applying a lot and going to hope I luck out soon. I have an appointment with a therapist on campus on Monday to explain how I was mentally last year when I fucked up so hopefully he can write a letter explaining this since I need proof to back up my explanation for my financial aid petition form and letter. So if all goes well, I may get a couple or few thousand in financial aid again on about October 10th when the next financial aid disbursement is. 

So my options are: 

1.) Ask my older sister who lives in the house for about $300 to borrow so I can deposit it to my bank account and ""buy off"" my dad so he is appeased and sees I have done this and that I ""really have"" the financial aid money. With this option, I would pay back my sister when I get a job soon or if I get my financial aid back in October. If I only get a job, I would stop ""withdrawing money from the other account (that I lied about)"" and tell my dad I want to keep it there and I'll pay what I need to with the money from my job. Bad thing about this is it's weird and my sister would know how bad of a position I'm in. 

2.) Desperately try to buy more time until I get a job or hopefully get my financial aid again. What I would do is pretend to get mad and say how my dad is always trying to control everything and that I would pay what I need to and he needs to just leave me alone with my finances already because school is already stressing me out. I already have been acting more depressed and they believe I'm stressed from school, I am, but the stress is coming mostly from this whole situation that I've been lying myself through for weeks. I am banking that I'll have a job by the time I need to pay my phone bill next month on the 15th or hopefully even get my financial aid right before my phone and loan payment are due. If not, I can still pay the phone since I have $180 to myself right now and the loan payments are flexible so I don't have to pay next month without a penalty. 

3.) I finally cut all the webs and come clean. This is the hardest option for me to pick and I honestly don't know if I can at all. My parents, especially my dad, will go insane on me, I probably deserve all they'll do to me, but I'm trying to do what I can to avoid this option. What would happen is I tell my parents that I have fucked up giganticlly. I would tell them how I failed a few classes last year from being depressed and stressed out, which I really was, and because of that, I had my financial aid money taken away and have lost eligibility for this semester, and that I know I need a job and am really trying, which I do and am. I would also say how I might get my financial aid back once I talk to a therapist and explain how I was last year when I did so poorly, and when they can write a letter to support my appeal. I don't know what my parents would do, they're not really ones to do this but I really believe they would get physical with me or lose all hope for me or something catastrophic. First of all, because of how much I have lied to get through this and fool them to save myself so far, and because of how I did poorly and fucked up to get to this low of a point. I can't believe I've done this to myself. I don't know how I would look at them the same after this. This is the absolute last option for me that I would have to resort to. 

I really don't know what to do. I wish this was all just over and I was never in this to begin with, but the only thing keeping me going is that this can all be over soon when I get a job and HOPEFULLY get my financial aid again. I have very much definitely learned my lesson. I never will let myself to this to myself again at all. I already am doing well in school with a strong effort to not do the same.

I'm in the honors program at a CC, and I am struggling with homework and studying and I just can't seem to be motivated to do anything. Everything is just scaring me... My Chem Honors class especially because my professor expects us to already know all about Chemistry but I forgot most of it and I'm worried about an Exam I have to take Saturday morning. In calculus I haven't done any homework in a week and a half and have a test this Monday but have work conflicting on the weekend. CS I have been doing well in, which is good. Also, in my composition class I have been doing well. 

I just feel like I need to find a way to motivate myself. I have had everything handed to me in my lifetime... Jobs, car, lunch money, auto insurance, scholarship to pay all of school, and I feel this is why I'm not motivated because I don't know what it is like to be motivated to achieve anything. Even my high school was easy, and I spent many nights not having homework at all or completing it at lunch and finished with a high GPA (not 4.0). 

So I have this feeling... I just want to drop out, go away, and work hard for a few years and enjoy myself. Then when I have enough money saved up, go back to school for CS at a local CC. The only issues I have are the following: my parents would probably be displeased and shun me, how would another college feel about me dropping 16 credit hours when I go in a few years after another CC trying to transfer to a four-year school, how do I quit my job when I just got my pay lifted a little and expect to get a new one?

It's the pure definition of a commuter school so I feel as if nobody really cares. (I'm a commuter myself) Come in take some classes and then leave. It didn't mean much to me when I read it on the Internet or by word of mouth. And it's a relatively small campus where you could get one side of the campus to the other within a matter of minutes. All of my professors are sweet genuine people. Which I appreciate a lot. I am a very amicable and animated person, and I don't even feel as if the student base is truly a base of students. In the sense that it's a congregation of people trying to get a degree. In between my classes I've entertained a few concepts already. Get a job to fill up some of the time I'm not doing too much. Transfer when I get the opportunity, or just ride it out until something changes. I'm looking to study either Italian or Spanish. But I want to be able to take classes in other languages.

I am an African American, 17 year old College Freshman (Biology Major) in Maryland that dislikes my own current University (personal reasons). In the long run, I plan on becoming a neurologist and attending medical school. My current University does not provide enough preparation for this and I would like to transfer to my State's Flagship University (University of Maryland, College Park). This university provides better opportunities and preparation for Medical School and the environment is considerably more enjoyable than my current one. The tuition of my current University is $4,600 per semester and the tuition of the University that I want to transfer too is about between $4,900-$5,100 per semester. I currently do not and do not plan on staying on campus. I should also add that my family does not take loans and unless I'm mistaken, I can't take out loans unless I am of a certain age. 

My parents, specifically my mother, do not support my idea of transferring and are extremely forceful to have me stay against my will. It hurts to be alone in this but I would like to become financially independent in order to support my own education and future goals in life. 

I plan on attending my current University for the first year, then transferring for Sophomore year. My current financials is practically zero since I am alone in this. 

**Here is my Plan:**
I plan on getting a job for Fall and Spring Semester and which will hopefully allow me to save up a crucial amount. While I do this, I plan to maintain a very high GPA and I will work for Scholarships and Grants to allow me to transfer easier. The University I want to transfer to has said that on certain departments and majors, they will provide merit aid for transfer students but have not specified which. The University also has an email for prospective transfer students to ask questions and garner other information. I can email them and ask them for specific things if you need more clarity. 

The job I work at depends because I know of some jobs that offer Earn and Learn Programs such as [UPS](https://ups.managehr.com/earn-and-learn-program.htm). Programs such as these would help very much since they practically pay half during a College Year. If there are any other programs such as these in Maryland, this would help very much.

I really have always wanted to go to a state university and it just was never presented as an option to me by my parents, they said either go to community college or this technical school. However, I really just want to go to a four year school and know if I don't do it I'll regret it. I really want the full experience, however, I graduated in 2013 and most people my age  are juniors now...so I know I'll probably never truly get that but I wish I could.

However, I would like to get a good degree, something more than just an associate's. I'm a good student and feel like the classes I've taken at my current school were so below my level, and I really would enjoy taking some more challenging classes in a variety of topics because I know I can do it, and I really am holding myself back.

Anyway. Because of my choice to stay at home and go to the school I mentioned, I have no friends and suffer from a variety of mental illnesses that are only exaggerated by my loneliness and environment. So I think I need to get out and go somewhere. I can't get financial aid or anything, but my parents finally said that if I knew what degree I was getting they would pay some of the cost.

But....here lies the biggest problem. I have no clue what to major in. I originally thought of going into the medical field, something like nursing. However, I know I wouldn't make a good nurse, and am squeamish at medical things and the sight of blood/organs/etc. I am good at arts and English but I really don't want a throwaway degree or something unusable. I just can't afford to waste my parent's money like that.What's a good major for someone completely lost?

Anyone have any advice on any of this? It's causing me a lot of grief and I really need to figure something out with my life. I'm wasting so much time and I'm so miserable.

My college has a list of approved proctors.  I've called the three in my area that are on that list - no replies.  Come to find that one university doesn't start their classes until the end of Sept and the other won't start until next week, so they're not answering their phones or emails.  The other (a library), the person on the list is hard to get a hold of.  Fun!

So, I did the next best thing and started looking up other local colleges and libraries that proctor exams.  Most want $40 to $50 to do one exam.  ONE FREAKING EXAM!

I had no idea what I wanted to major in yet and I didn't feel ready at all for college, but my family wanted me to go right away and constantly pressured me about it until I gave in (I wanted to work first for a while until I figured it out).

Since I had no idea what I was doing, I did not do well at all. Even receiving tutoring didn't help because I struggled a ton with the work, either not understanding it or missing the topic completely. I ended up quitting before the next semester because I didn't see the point in continuing to struggle like that.

Fast forward to now. I have figured out what I want to do and what I want to major in, but the problem is I owe a bill to the school for withdrawing and can't attend at all until it's paid in full (and it has to be paid all at once). I'm currently looking for a job, but it'll still take a while after to save up enough money to pay it off fully in one go. Someone did suggest I could attend another school, but I'd need transcripts for that and they don't release them if you owe money.

However, I accrued $5,000 in student loan debt. As the years went by I paid that off and decided to start looking into going back to school. A legitimate school this time.

I applied to two local community colleges and they both required a sealed copy of my transcript from any previous schools I attended.  Neither of the schools would let me go forward in the application process without it, even after I told them it was a for profit school and none of those credits would transfer (especially 10 years later) So I got in contact with The Art Institutes.  They told me there was a hold on my account for over $2,000! For over 10 years this was never sent to collections, I have never been contacted about paying them back personally.  They did say though, if I pay this amount the hold will be taken off my account and I can get sealed copies of my transcript.  

I just find it weird that 10 years has gone by and there has been no mention of this until I contacted the school about it.  I have even done credit reports on myself in the past and it doesn't even show up on file.  However, without this transcript I can't even go to other, legitimate schools.

To make matters weirder, recently, a lot of Art Institutes have been closing, including one in my city (not the one I attended, boo!).  If a school closes down, is it impossible to get copies of transcripts from that school? (probably not, huh? it's all one company so they probably have all the files from every branch).  Is there a way to get a sealed copy of my transcript without paying this hold? If there are no other options but to pay, I can do that, but is there any kind of paperwork I should ask for (after I pay) so I can put this debt behind me once and for all?

A mattress pad, sheets, bed spread, towels, bath supplies, school supplies, a backpack, electric tea kettle, etc. can add up pretty fast!

I know that I'll need things like.. a small hand held steamer.. extension cord.. shoe rack.. and then some items for my happiness.. like throw pillows.  The list is much longer but I'll spare you. 

I'm an only child so my mother has never done the whole college thing with another kid before. Obviously I will pay for some but she she is paying for necessities. Those logistics don't really matter.. but I just need to explain *why* it costs so much and that other people spend the same amount.. or something like that.

I do want a nice looking room.. I mean, I have to live there! Many of these items are things that I will use throughout my college experience (like the bed spread, pillows, steamer, kettle, etc.)... so the cost will be much lower in later years.. 

About how much did you spend to furnish your dorm room and buy school supplies? Basically the extra costs of living and a living space that does not include food. It seems like it can easily add up to $1000+.. in fact.. going over 1k seems unavoidable. Did you wind up using a lot of the things you bought freshman year in your later college years?

I made a mock up list of everything that I *want* (I won't get *all* of it and I probably have some things from home).. and it came out to be about $1650! WOW! I can't spend that kind of money! Unless that's standard for everyone... I mean this list literally accounts for everything.. bedding, throw pillows, and some wall decor.. all the way down to staples, tape, toiletries, and a backpack. Literally everything.... except for some items where I'll split the cost with my roommates.. like a printer and vacuum. 

EDIT: So about $500 of this cost is decor including bedding... and this is *nice* decor. Like a linen duvet cover, throw pillows, and actual picture frames kind of nice. The way that I'm justifying *some* of this is that I'm redoing my bedroom at home anyway.. and I wanted some of those things for that.. so essentially, I'd just be taking the throw pillows along with me.. I don't even know if I'll get all of it. BUT, that's still $1150 for everything else! Is that *normal*?

841,herejust4this,1438221101,/r/college/comments/3f3w0h/denied_pell_grantsfederal_loans_and_could_really/,"I was recently told that I have exceeded my financial aid maximum credit limit for the Pell grants I was receiving. I'm a little bit nervous about what I'm going to do and I could really use some advice. 

Here's some more details of my current situation: 
___________________________________
I'm not sure which information is useful so forgive me if I type too much and please tell me if I need to include anything else. Anyway, here goes. 

I only have 6 more classes I need to take at my community college in order to obtain my associates degree in Java programming in the state of Michigan. After which I planned on transferring to a larger (and more expensive) university which has a transfer agreement with my school to turn my associates degree into a bachelors degree in computer science once I complete the program. 

I have already talked to a counselor about a max credit appeal but unfortunately I was denied it. The reason they said I was denied was because financial aid requires you to complete your degree within 150% of the credit hours required. My current associates degree program consists of 62 credit hours and I was suppose to finish the program within 93 attempted credit hours. I have used 119 of the 93 maximum credit hours allowed for this program. The reason for taking so many classes at my school was I originally went for a certificate program in sound engineering which I finished successfully. After that I took a couple of semesters pursuing a degree in graphic design until I came to my senses and went for the programming/comp.sci. degree.

Because I make so little money I was able to pay for my entire tuition at my school using the Pell grant money I was provided. Now I don't really know what I'm going to do. I haven't had to take out any subsidized/unsubsidized loans but I would definitely be willing to if it came to that. The problem with that is that they won't even let me take out any federal loans because I hit my max credit limit. I had always assumed I would end up taking out loans if my Pell grants became exhausted but I had no idea they would block me from taking out loans.

My grant status on nslds.ed.gov says my Pell lifetime eligibility used is 512.606% (I've read the lifetime limit is 600%, or 12 semesters). The site also says that my total dispersed amount equals $23,232 by the way.

Anyway, here's my questions for everyone. First, will this max credit ineligibility status I currently have be carried over to the university I transfer to, or does it sort of start over/get readjusted for different universities once I transfer? Also, if I absolutely need to start borrowing federal loans how am I suppose to do that if they say I can't because of my current max credit limit? I'm really confused what to do right and could really use some advice.

   I ended up going to take my second placement exam today because the only solution I can think of is to start with some classes that don't require prerequisites and when I get awarded my financial aid use 200$ of it to pay my last bill that my dad said he would pay, but never did. He disowned me, and, long story short he was an abusive asshole that I no longer speak with and I can't ask him for money. I am now 29, with two kids, and my husband is disabled. My minimum wage job barely covers expenses but we are living with my in-laws so we all pool together to take care of each other. Right now is my only chance (with a semi-free roof, and built in childcare) to finally snag that degree that may be the key to making more than $7.25 an hour. 

Has anyone been in a situation like this? Are there any more resources for people like me? Is this plan a viable option?

Oh, and to make things worse, I scored perfect on reading and writing but it turns out I have had a learning disability called ""dyscalculia"" which makes math incredibly difficult. It also makes it extremely hard to read analog clocks, tell my left from right without looking at my hands, and perform choreographed dance. :| serious. I just found out after the Math portion of my exam came back with a 28/100, and googled :WHY AM I SO BA AT MATH?!?!?! Yeah I have had this the whole time. It explains why, in the math classes I DID pass I had such a hard time and had to take them at least twice. I REALLY need my old math credits to count, I worked so hard to pass those classes, and it doesn't matter anyway because anything I learn in math falls out of my ears like chlorinated water at the public pool. I am not going for a degree in anything that the profession will require any more math than what I already have been doing as a cashier the last 10 years.

I'm about to become a high school senior next year. While everyone's off to college visits and making plans, I'm stuck in limbo, not knowing what to do after being told of my family's financial situation. My dad earns $100k annually (he's an engineer), but that figure decreases after taxes, and my mom significantly lower (I'm talking min. wage). Exacerbating the situation, I have two younger siblings who are also in high school, meaning that they'll also be off soon; eventually all three of us will be studying somewhere, making it a burden for our parents to pay for our education. My parents simply can't afford to send me off anywhere, even to in state schools (Massachusetts). 

I want to have a career on nursing. If any of this helps, here are my accomplishments so far:

* 2050 SAT

* 33 ACT

* 3.3 cumulative GPA

* Taken the Chemistry CLEP exam

* Cameraman and video editor for my local TV station

* Volunteer for 2 senior centers

* Volunteer at my local public library

* HTML and CSS certifications

* Red Cross and ECSI certifications

* Skilled in photography (self-taught)

* Manager of my school's literary magazine

* Photo-journalist for the school paper

* Played a lead role in theater, simultaneously a tech crew member

* Member of one of my school's community service clubs  

* No sports; my parents can't risk me getting injured, which is understandable  


What can I do from here?  

Any kind of advice is greatly appreciated.  

**Edit**: I also have talked to my parents about community college, and still no dice.

I'm entering my sophomore year and I was thinking about doing an internship abroad next summer. I can't study abroad because I only have one gen-ed left and my major classes aren't offered abroad (at least not in the study abroad programs in my school). So since I can't study abroad, have any of you guys had any experience with getting an internship abroad? My current major is actuarial science but I have a finance minor so I wouldn't mind looking into finance/business related internships that aren't centralized around my major. I don't have any actuarial exams as of now anyway and I'll be sitting for my first one in April if that helps. I had my first internship this summer that had absolutely nothing to do with my major but it was good pay/experience! I'm not looking at those programs where you pay them to give you an unpaid internship abroad like CIS abroad or anything like that (can't afford that) - but do you guys know how to apply for paid internships abroad? I know it's unlikely that I'll actually get one but I would really love the opportunity and experience! So I'm looking for experiences and how to acquire international internships.

What do I need to do to in college to have the best chances of getting accepted into a very good med school?

A lot of people tell me a lot of different things. My biggest worry is the college I go to and whether it has what I need to really get the credentials I need for a good med school (i.e. research, volunteering, difficult classes). I know the MCAT is the biggest of them all, but I also want to make sure I can get the other bases covered on this as best as possible. 

I have a story of a friend of mine who went graduated valedictorian and decided to go to a small-private college in Mississippi (Millsaps College). She graduated at the top of her class and got a very good MCAT score. She also did quite a bit of shadowing and some volunteer work (not sure about the latter). So, anyway, getting into medical school should've been smooth sailing for her. And for the most part, it was. She was easily accepted into UMMC (University of Mississippi Medical Center), but that's not where she wanted to go. She wanted to go to Emory, but she didn't get accepted. My original plan was also to go to Millsaps College, but seeing she graduated at the top of her class, got a very high MCAT score, and shadowed a lot but still didn't get accepted even to in my opinion one of the prestigious med schools really worries me.

Now, I'm not sure what to do when looking for colleges. I can't got o an Ivey League or a school like Vanderbilt, WashU, or Duke because they are so expensive. I come from an upper-middle class family with three siblings, so I don't have a very high chance of getting financial aid from those colleges. My parents are wiling to pay for me to go to one of the best medical schools in the country, such as Harvard or Duke, and those are the schools I absolutely want to go to.

Now, my options are pretty much limited to state or public universities, such as Ole Miss, MS State, Bama, or LSU. My reach colleges are Vanderbilt and Tulane and my safes are Mississippi College and Milsaps College. I don't know what to look for in these colleges now or what to do in these colleges to get the best chance of getting accepted to those medical schools I want to go to. Please help! Should I look at research?, What should I major in?, Is prestige all that matters?, these questions if answered would be so helpful along with any other insight.

I know this is a lot, but thank you so much to whoever can answer!

849,[deleted],1435250098,/r/college/comments/3b382p/lost_a_financial_grant_by_04_gpa_do_you_think_i/,"Hi all.

So before I begin let me just state that I completely understand this issue is because of my performance academically, and I take full responsibility. I know they're not required to round up and no one owes me anything.

So I am going into my senior year at school and last year (junior) was my toughest ever in my engineering major. I am in ROTC, and my school offers a ""supplemental"" ROTC room grant if you can keep your cumulative GPA above a 3.00. This is checked annually, not by semester. The amount changes from year to year, but it's generally for around $9,000 for the year (the price of housing).

So my fall semester last year was honestly terrible. I just had never taken any classes that hard, and it seemed like I took all the hardest classes at the same time. Overall my semester GPA was a 2.1 (yikes!).

This past spring semester, I had similarly challenging courses, and actually 2 more credit hours than the fall, and I managed to earn a 3.5 GPA, quite the turnaround. Unfortunately this only put me at a 2.96 cumulative, and I see today that they are not extending the room grant to me (understandably).

I have also checked to make sure the document for the grant says ""3.00"" instead of ""3.0"" which I could technically claim 2.96 meets.

Anyway, it may not seem like much, but I really have no other source of funding. My parents can't pay for it (and that is completely ok with me), and I can't, even with the paid internship I have this summer. In all honesty, without this I might not be able to fully afford to attend. I also understand loans are an option, but I already have quite a bit out in loans and would prefer to stay away from more if possible.

Do you think I have a chance of getting it reinstated? I'm not sure how I could put my request into words to the school. I wasn't sick, no one in my family died, it was just really hard and even after catching up, I was a hair off.

Thanks!

EDIT: I should also mention that due to ROTC and engineering requirements, I have been over the ""full course load"" number of credits (16)  every semester since my freshman year. This year was especially bad with 21 credits in the fall and 23 this spring.

I like for my room to be an attractive, calm space so that I can keep my sanity. I know that when my room is a mess or uncoordinated, I feel a little more agitated, or exhausted. 

I'll be going to a private college with a tuition of over $60,000 a year. There are about 3,000 (or 5,000, don't know why I'm blanking on this) students in this school. And.. the dorms are totally hideous... also lacking AC. This is a world renown school.. and a lot of their other facilities such as the dining hall and library are beautiful and award winning.. but the living spaces are undesirable.. I've even heard that the dorm I'm in has mice. 

I just don't understand. If tuition is that high.. shouldn't the living spaces be improved?

I also don't understand the crappy looking dorm furniture and why they make it so hard for you if you want to switch it out with your own stuff. 

Why not live in an apartment instead? Well, at this school, it's mandatory for you to live in a dorm for your first two years, then you have the choice of a dorm or an apartment (the upperclassman dorms are a little nicer). So if we have to live in the dorms.. at a world class school.. that we pay a crap ton of money for.. why can't the living space be *nice*!?


**EDIT:** I feel like I must add this!!! I am not ungrateful in the least! I am beyond excited to go to this school!! I was just thinking about how much tuition is and wondering why our dorms, as well as dorms at many other schools, are lacking things.. like AC. Have you ever taken a look at MIT's Simmons Hall? WOW! That is a *nice* dorm building! I mean, when you go to school you're paying for the education but you're also paying for the facilities. When you're paying *that* much money, it would be cool to have nice living arrangements too. That's all that I'm thinking. I'll cope with the situation that I have.

I've never been to Portland nor have I been anywhere close to the west coast of the US, so I'm really nervous and scared, but I feel like I could really make this happen.

This is as far as I've progressed though, and I want to plan out everything it takes to ensure I'll be going asap.

A big thing I'm concerned with is how to pay for everything. I don't know shit about how to pay for this other than the fact that I'm going to need student loans to pay for pretty much all of it. I don't know the first thing about student loans though. I don't know who to talk to about getting student loans, how to use them to pay for school, how to go about applying for financial aid, etc. 

Also, can student loans help pay for an apartment or something similar like renting a room? This is a community college and doesn't have dorms or on campus living as far as I've researched so I'd need a place that's close to the campus. Could student loans help pay for something like that?

I chose Computer Science as the major that I want to go for, but I'm not sure how to officially declare that with the school. I took a programming class in high school and really enjoyed it so I'd love to look into the field especially with the demand it has now. 

I want to attend this fall or next spring, but odds are that it will have to be the spring. After talking to their admissions office I found that registration for this fall semester starts August 7th, so I have a little time to figure out which classes I could be taking this fall, however I'm in the middle of a one year lease with my apartment that ends in March of 2016. Luckily, the spring semester starts later in March after my lease will be up; however I want to go asap and I can't stress that enough. Unfortunately I'll probably have to wait until March to go so my lease will be up, I'm not sure what kind of punishment I could receive for breaking lease in September.

I want to plan everything out asap. When the time comes to register for classes I want to know what classes I'm taking and when I'd be leaving here to go to school. This is all very exciting because I love new people and new places but I want to get everything organized and ready so I can definitely make this happen. I really want things to work out.

I have an interesting story... I was accepted to the University of Washington back in the fall of 2013. Life threw a curve ball at me, so I ended up only taking classes my fall quarter, I withdrew both my Winter and Spring quarters. Fortunately, my family lives ~30 miles south of the University of Washignton, I was able to meet with them and what not. Though, the same situation applied Fall and Winter quarter. I did sign up for classes, tried to push through them, but life gets interesting... and I knew I can't continue my education without figuring out my situation back home, so I decided to commute this quarter (Spring).

Things are looking bright for the first time, I am powering through classes, everything seems great. I even landed an internship as a Software Engineer right in Seattle.

It's been a while, but I was busy and I had to make sure that people I know graduated or finished the school year before I can post about them. Anyway, this will be a more bigger and longer post about my experience at PCC. I made a few posts, but now I will go even deeper and share some things that may cause some trouble, but like I said before, I am done with that school, and I will never go back.

WARNING- The experiences that I will share are 100% arrcuate. There will be no BS, as everything is truth. And believe me, some things I will share will be personal, and some things that could get people expelled. Yeah, I mean it. I told myself that I wasn't going to reveal the information, but what can they really do? Nothing. Besides, the only thing I will keep private is names. For obvious reasons, you all should know why. So, let's begin.

Yeah, the first day I was there, I was actually impressed. The campus is pretty big. Everything from the Crowne Center to the Dorms were pretty big. Anyway, I went in, regestired, got my schedule and went into my dorm. I won't tell you what dorm I was at, but I can tell you that the room I was in was pretty good. And the roommate I saw was a pretty cool guy as well. Yeah, it was weird at first, but then it was normal. He was a senior, so he basically knew everything about the college. So, we went to get some lunch, and let me say, at that place, you will NEVER starve. Where I went at was Four Winds, which is pretty big. They had a variety of foods from fried to vegetables. And it was a buffet, which meant that we could take as much as we wanted. All we had to do was to swpie our school I.Ds at the front, and that's it. Everyone else had to pay for it. Anyway, I went back into my dorm with the family to hang out for a while. I remember that I had a schedule on a green piece of paper, and I had to go to the Crowne Center for two things. One, to fill out paper work for the work assistance program, and two, was orentation about classes and credits. Then we walked around the school, and then my family had to leave. Yeah, it was sad, as it was my first time being without them. And it took some time for me to get used to. But I'll explain that later. Later that night, I meet another roommate that was a close friend of the other one, as he was a senior as well. He was cool, but I have a lot to share about him in a bit. Both of them, in fact. Yeah, it was the three of us at the time, soon to be four. I think it was a day or two when the other person came in. Yeah, being with three other guys in a dorm and sharing one bathroom is not as great as it seems. Anyway, on sunday, we had to get up early, dress up in a suit and tie with dress shoes. We had to shave also. Yep. We are not allowed to keep any type of hair on our face. Either we shave it off, or we had to go back and shave. Sometimes we would get demerits, which I'll explain later. I remember for sunday school, I went into the Sports Center, which by the way, is a really great place at the college. But I went to the stadium. And let me tell you how they do worship. We all get hymns, we stand up, someone goes up and leads the group with their hand, conducting it like a choir. At first I didn't mind. But the more they did it, the more it was getting more ridicolous. Anyway, I think it was St. Clair. Yeah, I think he was a PCC Golden boy, as they would call it at the school. Then, we got a welcome, a message, and then we went to the Crowne Center. And let me say, that place is freaking big. It can hold up to thousands of people. I remember sitting at the top, and while everybody was talking, the church band would go up to the front, and play some classical chruch music. Then the chior would come up, dressed in green and white. That's what happened for a bit. Then, someone came up, who I thought was a Horton, but wasn't. He came up, said hi to everyone, and told everyone to turn to their hymn books to a song, and you know what he did, he did the exact same thing. He raised his hand up like he was conducting a chior, and leading everyone to the song. Yeah, at first I was ok with it, but then it got too repetitive, as I stated at my other post. It feels like they were forced to sing, and not singing unto God. As I looked and observed throughout the semester, it seems as people were just doing it as a hobbie, and not really singing it from the heart. Oh yeah, the broadcasted it around the internet, so they had to look good. It almost felt as if it were scripted. Anyway, after that was done, the president, Dr. Shoemaker, introduced himself to everyone. I can say that he really does care about the students, as I feel he was one of the few who actually did. Oh yeah, most of the the admistration would come up once in a while and smile and say some words, but when I see them up close walking by, they really don't care. Let me share a good example. A guy named Mr. Ashmore, is one of those people who conduct the whole church from time to time during church services. Anyway, Sometimes he works at the information desk, and he happened to be there one time and I needed to ask him something about chapel, since I was working during that time. I didn't know what to do, so I figured I'd ask him, and he would help out. HA! In a rude way, he said that I should've discussed that with my supervisor. Wait. I have NEVER been to this school, and not even a month, and that's how you treat people? Like they are nothing with no respect? Yeah, this guy was a phony. He acted like I was stupid. Yeah, so you smile up there for the camera, but you act so unprofessional in real life. That's fine. Yeah, that's the love you keep talking about when you sing those songs to eveyone. Just pathetic. Yeah, him and a few other staff memebers I've encountered with their rude behavior. I'll discuss that later. Anyway, let me talk about the work assistance and where I worked at. Yes, I will tell you where I worked, but not the location. Where I worked at was the PCC Print Shop. Oh man to I have a lot to share about that. For one, It was a walking distance from my dorm. And, I had to wake up super early in the morning. And between the school and the Shop was the gate. Yeah, they had a big gate across the campus. And yeah, we had to use our I.D cards to scan and go through. We then had to walk another mile just to get there. Then, we had to cross a sidewalk, just to get to the entrance. When we got in, the place really is a Print Shop. it was huge. Anyway, we meet our bosses, they showed us around, just for the first day. But after that, we got straight to work. And let me tell you, they don't play about that. In fact, for the dress code, we had to wear school appropriate clothing with our shirt tucked in, which doesn't make any sense to me. Why couldn't we just get a uniform from the shop? We work for hours and by the time we are done, we are sweating and tired, plus we have to walk all the way back! I mean it was just hard. Oh yeah, we had to shave too, or else we had to clock out, go back to our dorm, shave, and go straight back to work. It didn't happen to me, but I'm sure people weren't going to waste that time just for one little thing. If it happened to me, then I would just leave and never come back for the rest of the shift. Oh, something else funny. There is no internet acess at all. They block everything so that we don't make phone calls or stuff like that. The only people who had acess was the bosses. To me, I think that's a little parinod. Who would go that far just to make a point, oh this school would. But yeah, working there was rough because right after the bell rang, I had to go like crazy. I had to go ALL the way back and change in under an hour, with not enough time to eat. Sometimes I had to skip lunch and go to class hungry and tired. In fact, sometimes I just skipped class, because I was just too tired. I mean, I didn't know about any of this when I signed up, and I even read everything! It's not as it seems there. Oh yeah, the pay is just pointless. It's like pocket change compared to that 1800 or 1900 bill you have to pay. How the heck can someone work so hard and be paid just miminum wage? I mean, the president alone spends so much money for the school, like paying for a huge christmas tree at the commons, changing the commons completly, giving students 10 dollars free on the I.D to buy something at the Palms Grille, or hiring professional bike stunt people for a show at the turkey bowl, or renting a helicopter just to land on the field, I mean I could go on, but you see my point. Why spend money on the college for all these things? I mean, I know he's trying to make the college a better place, but can't he use it for other things? Things the students actually need, especially finically? I know there's schlorships and loans, and even the work contract, but those are really hard to get. There's just so much competition. They say the college is cheap, but in reality and from personal experience, it's just too expensinve. Those are my thoughts on that.

Moving on, let me share about the classes. Yeah, as I said on my other post, it's based on christian principles. And that, I had no problem with. But juggling work and classes, it was just too much for me. And yeah, if I was just tired, I'd just skip the class and sleep at the dorm. Hey, it was better than sleeping in class, which you can get in trouble for. The teachers, the ones I had were good. I had no problems most of them. Some teacher, however, were fresh out of graduating and just started teaching. And let me say, some of them don't know how to handle a class. It's like they try so hard, and yet I noticed that they get pissed off so quickly. Yeah, and some of the classes were people who were fresh out of high school. So yeah, they still acted like children. But yeah, nothing more on that. Now, Let me talk about the ""DORM LIFE"".

Now, for those who read this are from the school, read my warning, because I've already warned you.

I am eligible for federal work study, and have received an offer. There's a few things that I need to figure out before I accept or reject, though.

I recieve SSI/survivors' benefits, which helps keep a roof over my head for the time being, and go to school full-time; I have no current job experience. I've poked around the internet a bit to see if federal work study would impact the Social Security earnings, but the closest answer I've found is ""the earnings won't impact the benefits, but still need to be reported"", paraphrased from [here](http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1111&amp;context=edicollect).
I don't believe my college has a similar document, however, and I can't find any official information from the SSA. 

So far as the available work-study jobs run at my college, most of them are not directly relevant to my field of study (mostly clerical/office work positions), though it is still general work experience, and I'm fine with doing most of those available jobs as it is. I didn't have problems when it came to grades on my first semester (3.8 GPA)... but in turn, I had pushed myself really hard during the semester to get those grades. I was thinking of trying it out during summer, when I have only a few classes, but I'm unsure if I should consider it for the fall/spring semesters.

I can get through fine without taking out additional loans for the time being, but I have some existing loans already (totaling about 5k or so), and I want to whittle away at them if I can. 

I'm unsure if the pros outweigh the potential cons in this instance or not, and wanted to get some other opinions. 

**tl;dr** Soc. Security recipient w/no job experience and going to college is considering work study for extra money/general, non-major experience. Good idea or no?

I know I can't rely on random Redittors to make such an important decision (besides, I think I already know my choice) but I'm just looking for some more thoughts. I got into Penn State University Park and Syracuse University. While Penn State basically gave me nothing (I would have to pay 40k a year), Syracuse would only cost me about 10k a year. I am majoring in something STEM/Technology related (Most likely either Computer Science or Computer Information Systems). My parents say that they would rather take the hit if Penn State means a more financially secure long-term for me, but I can't imagine Syracuse being THAT much worse.

I'm a really, really terrible student. I'm the sort of person that, halfway through college I'm still just straight up not showing up or not doing homework (and double majoring in math and philosophy no less, so huge portions of my grades rely on it). Even if I do homework, sometimes I'll take a 0 before I turn in an assignment that I haven't completed. It's the same thing with quizzes (another large portion of the grade): if I feel I am shaky on material I will sometimes just not go rather than do poorly. This has resulted in a 2.7 GPA that has been absolutely all over the place, and frankly I'm surprised it's even that high. Obviously, I recognize the faults in these behaviors, and those times when I am consistent studying I can achieve good results. Sometimes the late nights studying will pay off in the most ridiculous ways and I'll get an A on a 20 page paper that was supposed to take weeks in only a night of work, or be near the top of a curve on a calculus test because I stumbled across the fountain of youth of studying strategies. Inevitably, these situations have become farther and farther away from each other, and I've never been so aware of that until now. Those are the things I can change.

What I'm afraid I can't change, is two-fold:

1. I'm a second semester sophomore whose semester is finishing up, and I'm **horrifically** far behind in my Linear Algebra class. I missed about two and a half weeks of school because of an abscess in my throat (as often as I fool myself into thinking I'm actually sick, you'd think I would have been more capable of dealing with actually being sick). I kicked my ass to get caught up on the midterm that I got pushed back to the week I expected to recover, and probably would have done decently well had I not gotten a bad sinus infection that Monday (and I want to reiterate that these are not feigned illnesses nor excuses to miss class; I wish I had been able to take the exam). My professor told me that I could take the final as my midterm, resulting in the final being worth a whopping 45% of my grade. In the meantime, I did very little to stay caught up. I attended class, but I only did about half of the homework assignments and missed at least one quiz. I kept pushing my studying back, and even when started it was always late at night and I was incapacitated with exhaustion the next day. I didn't request a leave of absence, I didn't go to office hours, I fucking missed a makeup quiz, and dropped probably my easiest class a yet inexplicable reason. All of the opportunities I had to rectify or postpone this semester (at least as far as this class are concerned) are gone. I might be able to scrape a C in the class, but if I do I won't deserve it at all. Any suggestions regarding cramming/anything related to walking into an exam worth 45% of one's grade completely unprepared would be welcome. This is a class I've taken before (though, granted under an extremely poor teacher and I retook it not because I didn't pass but because I felt I didn't learn anything), and is a class that I need to get a C or higher in to earn my major.

2. Every single time I approach finals season I find myself in this dilemma. I realize how fucked I am and what a terrible student I am, generally whipping myself into a first class frenzy instead of taking what time I have left to study. When I end up passing with mediocre to poor grades (I've been sitting at a B- average the entirety of my time at college), I swear that I'll do the right thing the next semester. And I do know what the right thing is, it just never ends up getting done. At this point in my college experience, when I've halfway determined how this is all going to turn out (excepting summer classes or additional years - which I'll get to later), it's obvious that this is no longer an easy thing to convince myself of. As crass as I've come off in this post, I've frankly been more down in the past couple of weeks than I have in a very long time. My room's a mess, I don't really have any food to eat, I don't hang out with my friends very often. I just inefficiently study and sleep. I really know I can do it, because there are long moments when I've tried hard and done well. But I just don't, again and again. I'm so embarrassed that I've backed myself into a corner of lies to my friends and family and they don't know how poorly this is all going, and I can't even tell my therapist (whom I've continued seeing since I started seeing her last year because of some drug abuse) because it's like speaking it makes it more true. 

It's true that this semester was unusually difficult for me because of pledging a fraternity, initially working almost 28 hours (another instance of me actively choosing to do something extremely difficult - my parents just said that I had to get a job and I picked hard labor in warehouse at nearly 30 hours a week), getting very sick and staying that way for a while, but even though I tell myself that and have told my mom that this semester won't go well because of that, I know that the underlying issue is that I'm ultimately not a good student. What's more, my laziness turns into really awful self-hatred and manic motivation that leads me to go up to 48 hours on only a few hours of sleep. 

Almost done, after a very lengthy post. I'm lucky enough to be going to a good school that my parents are paying for completely. Summer classes and extra years are on the table financially (and the two summer classes I've taken have resulted in some of my more successful classes), though obviously this would be something I'd like to avoid. Both my mom and my dad have doctorates and very highly value education, though my dad went through a similar experience his freshman year. They're very supportive and I would suspect my mom has an idea of what's going on, but despite the financial capability  they have my overriding feeling is guilt that I'm flushing this all down the toilet. 

Obviously, this is a complex issue and in retrospect I don't know if I would read through a post this long. I'd be extremely grateful to anyone with any sort of advice, anecdote, or outright criticism. Please be honest with me reddit, because I've gotten to the point where I don't even know how to be honest with myself.

At this point I have accumulated 49 credits after attempting 81. This past semester I changed my major to Marketing after being in the Comp Sci program for 5 semesters and though I enjoy the classes more, I can't seem to go a single semester without failing at least one. I have already racked up about $25,000 in federal loans even after blowing through nearly all of my college savings. If I continue to go to school, even if everything goes perfectly, I will leave with about $130,000 in loans.

My dad is well connected in his field, and has hooked me up with an internship for the summer with a company he does a lot of business with. There is a solid possibility, I'd say 95% chance that if I show this company I can work hard they will take me on full time. They basically owe my dad a favor.

Another thing to note is that I have accumulated a bit of credit card debt. My plan is to liquidate my 529 from which I can gather about $9,000, pay off my CC debt, and buy a car to commute to this internship.

Will the lack of a BBA screw me up while working in the business field? Is the degree I earn in college just supposed to get me in the door?

I got good grades in high school and had a mid-90s average coming to university. My grades in university so far haven't been as good as I've wanted them to be... My average is in the low 80s (I am in an essay-heavy program). I'm really bummed out because I got my grades this year and got 2 marks in the 70s (one is 77 and the other is 76) and it really shocked me. I'm really at a loss right now and I just feel really mad at myself and frustrated. I am going to talk to my professor about the 77 but for the 76 I don't think I can ask about it because I've already talked to him a few times and I feel like I'm bothering him (I emailed him after I finished my final exam and he didn't reply).
I went to a counselor earlier this school year to deal with stress and possible social anxiety but I didn't go back because I felt like I was taking up someone else's chance to get their problems fixed whose problems are worse than mine.
I'm shocked about my grades and if this had happened a few years back I would for sure be bawling my eyes out but I am feeling a little apathetic and sad at the same time. I care but at the same time I don't, because I don't know what to do. I really want good grades but now I am finding myself scared to put in the time to work really hard because I'm afraid it won't pay off. I can't really talk to my parents about this because because times are hard right now and I am just so lost...
I know there are people who have gotten worse grades than mine but does anyone here relate to this? Are grades in the 70s looked down on by grad schools/employers? I don't know what I want to do after I graduate so I'm looking at getting a job or going to grad school. I'm leaning more towards employment because I think I need a break from school. I want to pursue a career in management consulting but now I don't even know if I'll be considered with my grades (the two marks in the 70s are the lowest grades that I have, as well as a 74 in a first-year course from last year. My other grades range from low 80s to mid 80s, with a few in the 90s).

867,[deleted],1430022566,/r/college/comments/33w2iw/should_i_transfer/,"Okay, here's my situation.
In high school, I was a huge overachiever. I had friends but I was never super close to anyone. I didnt really mind it a lot, but there were points where I wished it were different. However, I did a lot of traveling, activism, research, entrepreneurship, etc so I did like that. However, I was over competitive and all I cared about was being successful and getting into a good school.
I ended up getting a transfer option to Cornell, so I decided to go to my local state school in the south.
In college, I party all the time, I'm in a sorority, and have a group of friends I hang out with a lot. My problem: I'm unhappy. I live in the honors dorm, so I have a bad rep for partying, my friend group has a lot of issues and I don't like them, and I'm not super close to my sorority. Then again, I always knew that I was most likely gonna transfer, so that also could be the cause of some of the problems. I also found out that I'm gay/bisexual and being in the South kinda sucks in that there's no pretty, femme, queer ladies. However, my grades are good, I don't feel competitive/stressed out about competition, and the school is cheap. I've been able to get super involved and go to conferences and such as well. But I'm constantly stressed about friends and social issues and sorority issues.
I got into Cornell officially a few weeks ago. Cornell is pretty liberal, apparently has a sizable gay population, my sorority is there, and it's a great school with a great program (AEM/Dyson). They also have programs for transfers, most of the transfers stay in the same dorm, and it could be the fresh new start I've been looking for. And I want to get back into getting involved and working toward my future more like I did in high school.
My problem: Some of the other kids transferring have over 50 credits while I only have 39 credits (technically only need 30 per year to graduate though). I'm also stressed because at Cornell, everyone is going to be successful and competitive and amazing, and I'll have more competition there. I don't want to be stressed out like I was in high school. Also, starting over again could be potentially really bad and suck-ish. But I don't like how I'm like here at my current school. I feel more insecure, overly-emotional, and less important than in high school.
I also want to go to Cornell because they have a sizable queer population and I really, really want that. It could also be better than how it is at my current school, since i've learned a lot from my mistakes here and it could be a good, new start. Also, i would be more likely to get a job from Cornell and I got into their AEM program which is pretty hard to get into, but not that hard of a major.
Family Situation: Also, my mom just lost her job (her contract was up - she's in IT) but my parents make over 300k so now its down to 200kif she can't get a job. However, i'm a triplet, and my sibling plans to go to medical school. However, she has a half-tuition scholarship and her and my other sibling both go to state schools. My parents also support my grandparents who live with us . My parents also own a few properties and have renters who rent out some of their properties but they also have to pay off those mortgages (Idk if their paid off). I told my sister I was stressed out about all of this and she told my mom, and my mom told me to stop stressing out and that we have money and she'll get a job soon and I'll go to Cornell no matter what but I'm stressed out and feel guilty about that. I also have an internship, and I'll be making around 7500 over the summer, full-time for 12 weeks. Might take a summer class but i don't want to be too busy.

868,Edd091,1429985581,/r/college/comments/33ua3n/as_a_former_student_at_pensacola_christian_college/,"Yes. I did go to Pensacola Christian College. After my experience of one semester there, I will never go back. And since I don't go there  anymore, I figured I might as well share my experience of what really goes on from the inside.

When I first arrived there, it was big. . It's pretty big for a christian college. Anyway, the first few days were basically registration and getting things in order. Not to also mention a church service every night until classes began. But I'll discuss that in a little bit. 

Anyway, the first thing I want to share with you is there "" Work Assistance"" program. You can go to this link- http://www.pcci.edu/financialinfo/workassistance.aspx

It will tell you about the ""wonderful opportunities"" they have and Student Testimonies about how they got through college just by working there. Guys, it's all a scam. It's not going to help pay for even less that HALF of your tuition. As a student working there, they pay less than 25% of your tuition, and you have to pay the rest yourself. Yes, they pay minimum wage for hard labor and work to students who are in deep financial need. I won't tell you where i worked at, since I'm going to remain anonymous, but I can tell you that where I worked at, they treat you like they would in the real world. Crap. You get to work. And let me tell you, I almost didn't make it. I was telling myself it wasn't worth waking up early to do this job, and then have to go to classes with barely enough time to shower and get something to eat. Then I had to do the make-up chapel service, since I was one of many students who had to work. If we didn't, then we would get demerits. To sum it up, it sucked big time.



Classes, they were OK. I really didn't have a problem with it at the start. Aside from the christian principles they had, It was fine with  me. Most teachers there are very smart and wise. They seem to know what they were doing. Some teachers, however, were new grads and they didn't have a clue on how to run a class. That's all I'm going to say about that.

Chapel is pretty much just like Campus Church. Only it's shorter, with announcements. Yep. We pretty much had Church everyday except for Wednesdays, which we had night service. Sometimes Chapel can be fun, but most of the time it was just like church.

Church services on Wednesday night and Sunday was like attending a funeral almost every time. It's too repetitive. When we go in, the church band would play the same thing over and over again. Then someone would come up, and conduct the church body like a choir with his hand. It was silly, and it still is. There's no real worship, no emotion. It seems like a job they wanted to do just to get over with. They looked like they were happy to be there, but I wondered if they just wanted to go home. And most of the time as I observed it, most people really didn't want to be there as well. The only thing that seem excited by the student body is the fact that they can sit next to each other. That's one of the only freedom the students had and they didn't take advantage of that. I remember groups of 20 people going into a row of two, just to sit together. Most didn't care about church, as I've observed. They just wanted to socialize. And at the same time, they looked like they wanted to go leave as well. But we didn't have a choice. We were forced to go to Church. Sometimes we would have special guests, but most of the time it was either Pastor McBride, or Mullenix. Mullenix is someone who would put many, many people to sleep as I observed. He put me to sleep sometimes as well. Yes, he does speak on important topics, but the way he does it doesn't make it effective. I even asked one of my friends if he was ever like this and they told me that you will get used to it. I never did, so whenever he speaks, I just didn't care. Even I just wanted to go to bed. Pastor McBride was cool. Everybody pretty much likes him. But I feel that there's only so much he can do as a pastor, since the system controls what he can and can't do. One more thing. We had to dress up for every service. We couldn't leave the halls without someone spotting you for wearing the wrong thing. To me, they feel like dressing up makes you better than everyone else in the world.

Residence hall life. Now, since I was older, it really wasn't much of a problem. Yeah, we had floor leaders, but they were cool. As far as my roommates go, I can't reveal much information as I want to keep them anonymous as well. But what I can say is that for myself, I didn't care about the rules after a while. For instance, they are tight on no headphones. At first I complied, but after making some friends who knew the system and broke that rule, I bought headphones and listened to anything I wanted. I was careful about where to use them and didn't get caught. Even when I walked off campus sometimes, I would slip them on and listen to my music. Oh yeah, the music rules. You can read it here- https://www.pcci.edu/pathway/StudentResponsibilities/CollegeStandards2.aspx

Yeah. They are tight about that as well. But, from what I learned, most of my friends listened to music that wasn't allowed. I even had incidents where I would walk into one of my friends rooms and they would be listening to artists like Imagine Dragons, or Bruno Mars. So, I did the same. Even for movies. I would go to an undisclosed location and use the internet to get movies or TV shows that I missed. To sum it all up, you can beat the system, but you have to be careful. Fortunate for me, I never got caught because I was. 

Dress code. It wasn't a problem for me, but they are strict on what you wear. They want you to be an example as a christian and to the world. In fact, you can read everything here- https://www.pcci.edu/pathway/

The segregation of males and females. Yes, they are serious about that as well. When I was there, most people told me that things changed, but some things stayed the same. There's a separate elevator and stairwell so that we can't walk together. There's no dating, unless we are older. At the commons they would watch people who are sitting together. There's no touching or hugging, which I've done a few times and didn't get caught. But it seems to me that people do it anyway, if they are careful. I heard a story from one of my friends that a guy and a girl had sex on campus and got caught by a security guard. Yes, they got expelled, but because of what the college stands for, that's why people do what they want. They love to enforce the rules, that it gets to a point where people just don't care anymore and do what they want. I knew people who were there for a few years and I was surprised at what they did. Some people make those choices, and whatever happens, it's on them.

The food there is good until it gets to the point where it gets sick to your stomach. That's all I'm going to say about that.

The Student Court is just ridiculous. You have to check on your computer to see if you have to go to student court. If you do, you have to wait in a long line full of students who most of them are there for no apparent reason. For example, since I was working, I couldn't go to some events. They actually have attendance cards that you have to give when you go in. If you don't, then you have to go to student court. Then you have to waste your time and tell whosoever ""judging"" you that you are working. Then you are on your merry way. I had to tell my boss that I was getting these notices and they should know that I was working. So they had to actually tell the office that I was working, and yet again I had to go down there again! Seriously...


But one thing bothered me a lot even before going to the college was that they really don't care about victims of rape. You can read the story here- http://www.xojane.com/issues/samantha-field-pensacola-christian-college-rape-stalking

After what I read, I couldn't believe that a christian college who claimed to be caring would expel people because they were in a situation that they had no control of. As I read more stories of the victim, and the more time I was on the campus, I was beginning to understand that the administration has no heart. They only care about enforcing the rules, no matter what. They stick to their code, and get a paycheck at the end of the day. They don't have compassion and reach out their hand, like Jesus would and comfort them. They don't want the police involved because obviously they are a private school and don't want to ruin their reputation. They brush them off like dirt and take their money.  And then the people who are responsible for doing it walk away with a degree.It's just sicking. Now, I know that some stories may not be what it seems, but is it hard to believe that PCC would turn their backs on their students? Is it?

In all, I wouldn't encourage anyone to go to this school. It's like a occult. A daily routine with no change. Even with the friendly people and some people who care, it's just not worth it. Even the most of the education there is not accredited. That means all of your hard work and money spent just goes to waste, because you can't' get a job in most places. And that's bad. I won't take anything from that college except for the friends I've made there. Like I said before, I'm not going there anymore and don't plan to. So, I decided to write about it, and I did.


UPDATE- Anyone can ask me anything on here about Pensacola Christian College. Like a AMA of whatever they do on here.

UPDATE 2- Look, I'm not bashing this school and telling everyone not to go there. I'm just sharing my own thoughts and experiences after what I've been through. I wouldn't encourage anyone to go there. But hey, if you feel that it's the right place for you, it's fine. Whatever knocks your boat, I don't care. At the end of the day, it's your choice.

UPDATE 3- There's plenty more things that I could share, but i'm going to wait until their school year is finished. Why, because no one at the school will really care and some of my friends I know will be graduating. Then they won't get in any trouble. I don't want to risk their graduation if someone shares this post to people who would be interested in it. I will share stories about them when the time is right. I will also share why I had to leave Pensacola in a more detailed post when the school year is over . Stay tuned......

869,[deleted],1429857309,/r/college/comments/33ope4/giving_up_the_dual_workcollege_life/,"Hey all, so i've been in college about 4 years now. Started at a CC-worked 45-50 hours a week. Got laid off from a great job-worked lesser jobs for the past 2 years.

For my first 3 years at CC I was a great student. 3.7 GPA, working full time. I had no free time. No time to meet anyone. Lost a lot of friends. 

At my university, I am doing shitty in comparison. Sure the courses are harder but I am not a 2.7 GPA student. I'm stuck working 2 jobs, both atleast 20 hours a week and juggling school. After nearly 4 years of this, I am burnt. Hate school.

I don't want to be burnt. And thankfully, my car lease is up next september. Outside of my car payments and insurance, my only expense is about 75 dollars a month for credit card payments.

So my idea is this: Leave one of my jobs, drastically cut back on the other to 15 hours a week. Take out an additional 3 grand per semester to cover cost of living. Work seasons. Work summers.

Is that viable? I can't get grants or federal waivers-my family on paper does well for ourselves, 200+grand a year,when in truth were floundering under the IRS and my parents poor credit planning 10 years prior-so the government views me as well off-when really I am on my own.

So more debt in the long run- to remove stress an do better in the short run? 

I don't want to be a bad student, but I Am just so burnt out from 3 years of 35-50 hour work weeks+college-just to pay for bills, insurance and Gas.

I have great business and marketing experience-and great culinary experience at this point. ",college,Giving up the dual work+college life...,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/33ope4/giving_up_the_dual_workcollege_life/,1429875309.0
870,Soph573,1429289925,/r/college/comments/32xwep/considering_changing_my_major_at_a_very/,"I'm a freshman at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, a university which is very well-known in the airline and security industries as well as in some business circles and scientific communities. I'm currently studying Global Security and Intelligence Studies, which focuses on security, intelligence, business, language (I'm taking Arabic and I'm halfway done), and world geography and politics. The degree primarily will prepare you for work in three-letter agencies if you want to go the government route, but large aerospace companies like Boeing and Lockheed have been known to take quite a few GSIS graduates as well, plus everyone needs security experts. I've had a passion for security and protecting people ever since 9/11, and I work a security job back home that I've really enjoyed. This was my dream school, and the only school that I applied to (high schoolers, if you're reading this, don't do that. It's extremely stupid and risky, but I knew I would get in and the timing worked out perfectly so that's the only reason it worked out). 

I originally came here looking at their stellar aerospace engineering program, which is one of the best in the nation. I've been in engineering classes since 7th grade and science has always been probably my strongest and most intuitive subject. Engineering came very naturally and it seemed like the perfect thing to study in college. When I came here for a tour though, I got to sit in and experience a class dealing with the history of terrorism for GSIS, and I was hooked. I changed my incoming major from aerospace engineering to GSIS and hadn't looked back--until recently. 

Probably my longest-running passion (sometimes bordering on obsession) is with astronomy and physics. It's extremely empowering when you figure out for yourself how the fundamental forces of the universe come together and interact to create beautiful structures like nebulae, superclusters, galaxies, solar systems, and our gorgeous planet. I wanted to be an astronomer and an astronaut ever since I was a kid, but in high school I went through a phase where I thought that would never happen and there just wasn't a future in it, so I moved on. It was always nagging me at the back of my mind though, and we do have an excellent Space Physics program here that has been very successful. 

I have friends in Space Physics, and although the courseload can be very rough they were always happy and full of passion for the subject. In GSIS, the courseload can also be difficult in other ways, but a lot of the people are extremely competitive and negative. When you ask for help in Space Physics, everyone works together towards the same goal willingly, and there is a lot to be said about camaraderie in a small program. When you ask for help in GSIS, you are usually seen as weak and incompetent, even when the whole class can't do the problem. It's a mentality that can get very depressing after a while, and it's hard to stay motivated sometimes when you know you can't ask for help from your peers without being judged. GSIS people are usually very proactive A-type personalities as well, and I'm definitely not an A-type, but in the eyes of some that translates as weakness. I can still do all my work on a great level, but I'm not really the one to lead a group and call someone in the middle of the night to yell at them about a group project due in a month (true story). It's tiring when everyone around you is trying to outshine everyone else even though the program isn't as competitive as the STEM programs. Regardless, I'll be seeing the people from my school for the rest of my life since our industries are pretty well-connected, so good relationships will pay off. I feel like I fit in more with the astrophysicists, who are extremely happy about 90% of the time and are always willing to talk and help others out, whether it be for classes or with life in general. They are very tight-knit as a family due to the small number of them, but they are remarkably inclusive. I've already been welcomed ""into the family"" and even have access to the special building reserved for physics students called the Cave. Even if they end up competing for internships I have always seen them be very gracious if they don't get it and congratulatory if someone else finds the perfect internship. GSIS people can be very bitter about internships and the competitiveness carries over to nearly every aspect of life. 

If I switch to Space Physics though, I will have to go through at least eight years of grad school after my undergrad is completed, so the next ~12 years I will be in school working towards a doctorate. I feel like these are the best years of my life and I don't want to waste them, but if I'm working and passionate about what I'm doing, then I feel like I'll be happy for far longer. None of my classes aside from some history and English will carry over from my GSIS classes so I'll basically start off as a freshman again next year if I switch. I don't really have a problem with that though since I'll still minor in GSIS and Arabic and Middle Eastern Studies. Basically all I have to do is sign up for new classes and officially declare a new major. It's making a few clicks online and turning in a form, but I just want some second opinions. My family and friends are incredibly enthusiastic about the change and believe it's the right place for me, the Space Physics students are very excited to have a new family member, and the GSIS students looked at me like I was crazy and basically dismissed it. I think it's a good choice to do Space Physics, but it will change the course of my life. 

What do you think? 

TL;DR: I want to switch majors to something more science-based rather than security-based. Security people are generally not very welcoming or friendly and prefer competition, science people have great camaraderie and help each other out. If I stay with security, I do 3-4 years and go into the field, if I do science I'll have to go through grad school, so about ~12 more years. I love science and I'm lacking that in security.

871,5ivesos,1429258246,/r/college/comments/32wi6u/i_feel_no_passion_for_university_and_im_in_my/,"Hey everyone!

I'm a 3rd year Bachelor of Arts student, majoring in Politics and Literature, living and studying in Melbourne, Australia, where I've lived my whole life.  I'm in my second last year of uni now and I still feel absolutely no passion for what I'm doing and don't know what to do/how to regain passion.

I'm on an amazing scholarship - I worked crazy hard in high school which has gotten me a scholarship for my undergrad which means I pay no fees, get $5k allowance from uni per year, get guaranteed entry into any postgrad course (as long as I meet subject prereq's), among other things, so it's not really a good idea for me to move from the uni I'm currently in because of all the massive benefits and opportunities there are.

But then there's still the question of my lack of passion. I can't seem to put any effort into any of my studies which is weird because I'm at university, I'm choosing what I want to study, but what I'm studying just doesn't interest me as much.  Throughout my 2 and a bit years of uni, I've enjoyed a handful of subjects (most of them lit subjects though a lot of lit subjects have been hit and miss) but that's about it.  

I'm lost. I don't know what I want to do with my life after uni either lol, probably education or working in a NFP? I don't know.

872,ScaryFaces,1429149834,/r/college/comments/32raff/only_16_days_left_to_make_a_decision_and_im_stuck/,"SO. I've basically narrowed it down to 3 very different schools, and I can't seem to pick one. Don't get me wrong, I'm not letting reddit decide for me which college to go to; I just want some advice or experiences. 

**So here's the deal:** 

- I don't know what I want to major in (could honestly be anything, preferably something challenging), but I'm considering engineering as a possible option. 

- I'm very fortunate, as my parents have said that they will be able to pay for my entire undergrad education, but I am a bit uncomfortable with the thought of taking so much their hard-earned money, especially if it's not going to lead to anything worthwhile. 

- I live in a smallish suburb in Maryland, where at least half of my school and half of my county is attending UMD. I *really* want to get the hell out of here and reinvent myself/start something new. 

**The colleges:**

1.) Northeastern University

- Pros: Their co-op program is EXTREMELY good, and I feel like I can easily get a job after graduation. Also, living in a city would be interesting and a, hopefully, pleasant change of scenery compared to the suburbs. Their undeclared program (which I got accepted into) would also definitely help with the whole *oh god what am I going to do with my life* thing, and it is a smaller school population wise (compared to my other colleges) as well. I also really like the whole ""vibe"" of the college, as well as the campus. 

- Cons: Although I'm not sure this is necessarily bad, but it has a less traditional college feel (no Greek life, football, and the small campus is basically integrated into the city). Students leaving for co-ops, along with the fact that there isn't really much of a campus/social scene (at least not until you're 21) could make it intimidating to make new friends, especially for someone really shy and introverted like me. Lastly, it would cost ~$50,000 per year to attend, almost doubling the costs of my state school. 

2.) University of Illinois - Urbana-Champaign

- Pros: I was accepted into their engineering undecided program, and their engineering program is VERY prestigious, and like I said before, I'm considering doing engineering, but I'm not really sure about it. The campus is also extremely large; there's a lot to do, and with a population of 40,000 people, I'm sure that I'll be able to make friends with someone. Basically, it's an all around great school, especially for engineering, and I'll be far away from Maryland. 

- Cons: I know how this might sound and it's kinda irrational, but there are A LOT of Asian international students at UIUC. When I visited, I did not see a single Asian student hanging out with anyone other than their groups of other Asian students. Being Asian, I feel like there might be some stigma associated with being Asian, as people might just shrug me off as another typical international student who doesn't speak English. Again, probably irrational. Furthermore, because the campus and populations are so big, I feel like they might be *too* big and I won't be able to receive any individual attention. I also am not sure I even want to do engineering, so being in their engineering undecided program might have negative consequences. Lastly, this school also costs ~$50,000 per year. 

3.) University of Maryland - College Park

- Pros: I save my parents a ton of money by going to this school (around $100,000); the cost is only $24,000 per year. UMD is a *great* and very well rounded school with many of their programs, such as engineering and business, ranked very highly. The campus is a pretty good size and there would probably be lots of social activities there with its traditional ""college experience."" I am also in the general studies program. 

- Cons: As I've said before, I really want to start over and go somewhere new, and a part of me feels like that will never happen if I go to UMD. ""But UMD is a big school! I'm sure you probably won't see most of your classmates from your high school anyways!"" It's not even the fact that a lot of people from my class are going, but it's that  I've gotten sick of the whole ""vibe"" of my county and area, and I just want to leave everything behind. I'm also not particularly fond of the campus; I think it's kinda ugly. However, UMD is still a really good school and is near the DC area, which is great for employment, and in all honesty, I probably wouldn't even be *that* miserable if I went there.

This is a problem because I am planning on attending graduate school next year (took a year off for various reasons).

Well because I had a really bad GPA in high school I had to go with a transfer pathway at my Community College. My original transfer pathway degree was information systems, but I have wanted to change my major to Geology, but can't because my CC doesn't offer that. Anyways I started with 5 classes last semester and dropped 1, and stopped going to another by the last 2 months. I made a D in English 1, music appreciation, and American history 1.

Because I made below a 19 on the math portion of my ACT (I made a 21 composite so not good at all) I had to take remedial type of math to take the regular math classes needed for my transfer. I ended up stop going to that class because I was in the middle of a falling out between me and my dad while I was still living with him. I was extremely depressed last semester and it took a lot for me to even go to the 3 classes I had left.

This semester I came back with a better attitude, but things quickly went downhill from there. I started with 5. Speech, Remedial Math, computer applications, American history 2, and Theater. I dropped the Computer App class pretty quickly because It started at 4PM while all my other classes were early ones. I just couldn't do that because It interfered with my work schedule . Next was speech. My deal with speech wasn't giving the speeches it was writing them. I have never been good at writing essays. I have like permanent writers block, and after struggling for the first 2 months I dropped that class. I dropped theatre because I had to start working more to pay some of my bills. I dropped remedial math again, because I started to give up. I felt like I just wasn't ever going to finished this. I couldn't pass competency 2 after 11 takes, and by then I was behind everyone. American History 2 is the only class left and I am actually doing really good in it.

So I started with 5 classes and ended with 1.

I fucked up really really bad. This was a complete waste of money and just a complete lost year for me. I don't know what to do. I can't do summer classes, because its 5 days a week and I can't afford to drive back and forth everyday. its only 15 miles away but my truck doesn't get good gas.

I really need some help. I need at least 30 credits to transfer to MTSU. I am in a panic and don't know what to do.

878,theplan101,1428065025,/r/college/comments/31axyy/considering_dropping_out_in_the_us_and_starting/,"This is my long, frustrating story. If you spot alternatives, please let me know I'm just reporting situations as they've happened to me. If you're not familiar with the American college system this may not make any sense to you.

I am American in my mid 20s so not much time left. A few years ago, my family and I moved to Washington state.

I now attend a community college here. I wanted to study the french language and american government (or along international relations/world history). These are subjects that I'm really passionate about and I've made nothing below a B- (3.30 GPA) in my studies so far.

About 4 semesters in, I'm now told my college is removing courses due to budget cuts. At the same time, I need these courses to graduate. I need these courses to fulfill my credit requirements. 

They have cut the french language (unofficially, in favor for spanish). I'm told the protesting, petitions, and etc. have all already occurred in the class before me. Higher ups weren't phased. The other students have no idea what to do either from what I've gathered.

The college that I attend is the only practical college ""in state"" in Washington until Olympia/Seattle (4-5 hours north by Amtrak.) There is another university but they do not offer languages whatsoever! The trend continues to spread it seems.

I've contacted the Vice President. He and my advisor came to the conclusion that I should try to fulfill my credits at another school. Problem is, I'm 10 minutes away from the state border.

All of the universities start 15 minutes from me in Portland, Oregon. Oregon considers me ""out of state"" meaning I'd pay out of state tuition even though they're 15 minute from me. Portlanders themselves can [barely pay *in state* tuition](http://koin.com/2015/03/12/psu-students-expected-to-protest-tuition-hike/).

I researched this a bit more and Financial Aid will bail on me also. I was told by the Financial Aid dept at my school that Financial Aid would only pay for my ""home"" college, not another college at the same time, especially out of state. 

Also, to receive Financial Aid I would need to go ""full time"" (12 credits) to have everything paid with the pell grant. My entire problem is over about 4 credits for now. 

The universities in Portland are clearly not a practical option and after research, I'm seeing that the community colleges may not be either. 

I need about 4 credits in french to satisfy my degree however community colleges in Portland offer the course at only 3 credits per class. Meaning, I'd need to take two, 3 credit classes just to get the one extra credit to fulfill my degree. 

According to their website, and without the help of Financial Aid, I'm looking at [200€/ $220 per credit.](http://www.pcc.edu/enroll/paying-for-college/tuition/). This is out of my pocket while still trying to keep up with my courses/tuition in my home college.

None of this is for sure. I was told that even if I did go to another college to do all of this, I'd have to have these credits ""approved"". There is a whole ""petition"" process. The other advice I was given is to start over ..with Spanish. For starters Spanish obviously isn't my passion and secondly I don't know if they'd cancel spanish halfway through either!

All I wanted to do was learn french, study government, get my degree and transfer. I don't understand why it has to be this complicated. There has been other issues too, like this college requires 3-4 pieces of documentation for me to qualify for ""in state"" tuition which of course I have them all dated at different dates. This means that although I do have 2 documents and proof of residency like a bill, because one document is not one year old I'm paying out of state tuition even now. Financial Aid barely covers it due to the out of state tuition eating away at so much. I only got $30 left towards books and I'm taking 25 credits the semester.

What I've considered lately is dropping out. My associates means nothing in Europe form what I've read. I can't seem to get my degree in the US at this rate and even if I did I don't think it would be worth much more than it would be in Europe. The only thing transferrable in Europe would be my high school degree correct? In the US I'm also concerned that taking on $16-20,000 in student loan debt will prevent me from otherwise visiting Europe if I don't go now. I'm considered out of state, everywhere I turn. The tuition seems to be getting out of hand especially compared to living my studies in Europe.

Instead of continuing my associates I plan to get a job in the US and save up for about a year. I would save up the $7,000 or so required by the visa, planet ticket, and save up enough to take up a language school to learn french. I would go to france by finding a school to teach me what I need to know to pass the Delf, Dalf, TCF exams. I already have a few semesters of french under me so in the immersed environment abroad I'd hope to learn incredibly faster. 

From there I would enroll into a university for my L,M,D studies. The only thing I have not worked out is continuing the income of money but my family said they'd *try* to help.. although I'm not confident. I also have no real skills, which is why I want to hurry this along so I can have something to show for myself. Once abroad I would likely change my studies from American government (irrelevant?) to the diplôme universitaire de technologie and do network security.

This has been my story and my alternative plan so far. I'm not saying it will be easy but it's my alternative plan at least. I would really like my bachelors before I'm 30. I can't say too much here, as I said I've spoken with people in the know but this is the gist. What do you think? 

Most people I could ask want me to remain in the US my entire life. Others I've asked already in france have been helpful but lacking the perspective of being either American or in France. I'd highly prefer someone familiar with both to judge or just anyone that has done something similar to start over in france.

I apologize ahead of time for this long post-any advice you can give would be appreciated! I'm a college freshman choosing between two very opposing career options: a singing career or a career as a fashion designer. Some background on me in both fields: 
      For singing,I've always enjoyed it. I was in choir from elementary school through my first semester in college(unfortunately,I don't have room for it in my schedule this second semester),and show choir for three years in high school. I've performed in middle school musicals, and sang when I was in pageants for two years. I simply love performing. It makes me happy in my very core. I sing in the shower, I sing..everywhere,I guess. I don't think I'm the most amazing,but I am at least fairly good.I love singing. However, I am unsure if I have enough talent to make a career. I love performing,but of course the money sucks in it,and it's a very tough path to go into. Success is very slim,and it takes a long time to get to a point where you can make a decent living off of it. It's tough raising a family as well,of course,and on your spouse. Of course I can't guarantee we're together, but it's a pretty good bet I'll marry my long term boyfriend who's going into software engineering, it's not like he could travel with me.

Fashion Design:
I just got very into fashion a couple years ago- I truly love it. I run a fashion and lifestyle blog, and I'm currently studying fashion design at a state university. My classes are hard,but interesting,and designing clothes is fun.The actual career part is the only thing that I don't like. I hate the idea of sitting in an office all day, making money for someone else. I dislike the idea of sitting in meetings, just the daily life. I want a fascinating life. I don't want my own business,though. My university has an amazing placement rate for internships and jobs in this field with big companies, it's almost guaranteed I'll get a decent job with fairly good pay. I could make a living off of this.

I want a career where I'm known- I want to inspire millions, be on magazine covers. I want to travel,and go to fun events. I want to meet up with fans and have a job which doesn't feel like a job(which is my main concern with fashion). I love singing,and the thought of a career of that is amazing. Also-many singers have their own clothing lines, so I could do both,which makes me even happier.

But- I'm faced with the practicality of it. Is it even practical? The most practical option would be to see if I could do both- I'll have an internship in NYC hopefully in the next couple years for my fashion degree,and I could audition and take voice classes in my spare time. But if I did get chosen for something after I have a career in the fashion field, it's not like I could just come back to my job. Singing in the early stages isn't a steady flow of constant work, you take what you could get. It's not like I could do it on the side and keep doing fashion work until I hit the big time.

 I'm just completely unsure of what to do-do I simply forget about my singing dreams to go somewhere where I'm guaranteed money? Is there some sort of balance? If I wanted to go for singing, and I wasting my time in college for fashion the next three years?How would I go about starting in the singing business-move to somewhere and start auditioning?Should I study voice instead? So many questions, and I have so many worries. What should I do?

TLDR: I'm choosing between pursuing a job in the fashion design industry or going after a singing career, and not sure where to go from here.",college,Unsure of what to do for my career and college future.,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/307khr/unsure_of_what_to_do_for_my_career_and_college/,1427269054.0

I'm pretty sure I will get bright futures that is offered in Florida but outside of that I'm not sure what to do. 


I want to attend UWF because they have an amazing construction management program. I was hoping I could score a 32 on the ACT and get a full ride. However, I'm not sure if they offer full rides for ACT scores at UWF. The 32 score is very much reachable. 


Any advice for me? Also, if you have any knowledge on ACT full ride scholarships, please let me know!

881,Greentoads41,1427207580,/r/college/comments/304uzv/financial_aid_gap/,"Hey guys, high school senior here. I applied to a bunch of private colleges, got rejected by some, accepted by some. The other day I was lucky enough to be accepted to Middlebury, but in terms of financial aid, they told me that they cannot offer me any grant assistance in paying for it, but I'm eligible for $5500 in loans. This really surprised me, because all these other colleges I got accepted to are similar in tuition/price, but they are all offering me around $40k in assistance so the total price I'd pay would be around 15-20k, around the figure of my EFC. 

This doesn't seem to be the case at Middlebury, which is why I'm so confused. They boast about being a need-based school that covers 100% of financial need, so am I missing something? Maybe they didn't get a document from me? But they would have contacting me requesting it, so that couldn't be the case. I just can't believe that they looked at the same documents as all these other schools and decided ""yup, this kid will pay full price"" while the other colleges offered assistance.

Is there something going on here that I don't understand? Is this common for some schools to think this? Is there any experience of this happening on your end?

My parents pay for community college but I'm on my own for a 4 year university.  I work between 35 - 40 hours a week and can't really afford to work less.  I'm majoring in history and lately have come to the realism that history is mostly reading and writing. Most of my history teachers give their opinion out of a reading from the class textbook.

883,[deleted],1426938672,/r/college/comments/2zsr52/cant_decide_where_to_go_to_college_help_is/,"I've received most of my admissions decisions back from the colleges that I applied to, and I truly cannot decide the best college to attend. I'm not looking for any definitive decisions right now, but I was hoping that the collective knowledge of r/college could possibly help guide me in the decision making process. 

I've been accepted to the University of Michigan (LSA), Washington University in St. Louis (Arts and Sciences), Northeastern University (D'Amore-McKim School of Business), Indiana University (Pre-Admit to Kelley School of Business, Hutton Honors College), Bentley University (Honors Program), and the University of Maryland (Scholars Program, Pre-Admit to Smith School of Business). I was rejected by the University of Virginia, and I was waitlisted by Boston College. I am still waiting on decisions from University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and Lehigh University.

Before I discuss what I think about these colleges, here's some context that will most likely make the decision much harder. My parents have agreed to contribute a significant amount of the cost of college, but I will certainly have to take out student loans to pay for school, wherever I go. Accounting for merit aid that I have received, my family contribution, and the total cost of attending each of these schools, I will have to take out the following in loans to attend each of these schools: UMD ($24,000), IU Bloomington ($40,000), NEU ($56,000), WashU ($70,000), Bentley ($48,000), UMich ($108,000). These estimated costs also account for the increasing rate of tuition (Adjusted for 5% annually), the increasing cost of housing (Adjusted for 2% annually), books, meal plans, personal expenses, and transportation costs. I really do not want to put myself in a position where I'll have to pay off student debt for decades after I graduate, but at the same time, I want to attend the best school that I can, and graduate in a position to get a job in the financial services industry. Currently, I'm thinking that I'd like to enter corporate accounting, investment banking or consulting, but I am open to really any position in a similar field. 

In terms of what I want out of a college, I do value the opportunity to go to big sports games and have a sense of school spirit (Which I really wouldn't have at a place like WashU or Bentley). I would also like to be at a medium to large sized school (which discounts Bentley). The idea of flying to a school isn't too appealing, but I am not opposed to it if it's necessary to go to the school that's right for me. Being in or close to a city is something that appeals to me as well, which is why I'm hesitant to go to a place like Indiana. I also want to be at a college with a relatively active social scene and things to do on the weekend, which I'm sure is really possible at any school I go to. Additionally, I don't want to put myself in a position where I have to study relentlessly on the weekends and have no social life due to the work load or course rigor, which is why I'm also hesitant to go to a place like WashU. I've heard from current students and relatives of current students that WashU is incredibly hard to succeed at due to the nature of the coursework and the difficulty of the programs offered there. I also recognize the fact that it's unrealistic for me to expect to satisfy all of these needs at one college while also keeping my student debt to a minimum, which is why I'm so conflicted with this decision.

One of the things that's factoring into my decision greatly is school rankings and the general reputation of the schools I'm considering. I recognize the fact that rankings really have no bearing on the quality of education or job placement at a school, but for some reason I can't justify going to a school the caliber of UMD or Indiana after being accepted to a school like WashU. 

Wherever I go, I'll most likely be attending the undergraduate business school within that college, which also factors into my decision. While Indiana University isn't necessarily highly regarded nationally, the Kelley School of Business is very highly ranked in terms of undergraduate business programs. I really don't know how a program like Kelley at Indiana compares to a program like D'Amore-McKim at Northeastern or Smith at UMD. While the other aspects of this decision are certainly important to me (School spirit, location, social life, etc), really the most important thing to me is that I put myself into a position to get a well-paying job right out of college. I'm unsure whether or not I'll want to pursue graduate school after my undergrad education, but I think that's a decision to make further down the road. 

Any input on my decision is appreciated, particularly from those redditors that currently attend/attended the school's that I'm considering. If you have any input on my conflict with student debt, my decision with regard to the caliber of each school, or any of the aspects that I mentioned that play a factor in this decision, your help would be greatly appreciated. Also, if you have any experience with or knowledge of the standing of these schools with regard to employers in the financial services industry, that input would be greatly appreciated as well.

Anyway, now I'm in community college to finish up an associate's and save money. I want to continue on to at least my bachelor's so I'm trying to figure things out again.

I've wanted to go to the same school since sophomore year of high school, my parents could afford it but I can't. Since they make x amount of money I can't get enough aid to pay for it on my own and I can't apply for aid as an independent student. I  applied for ~8 entry level jobs a couple of months ago and didn't even get any calls. I'm also on a freelance work site but I've only completed a few tests and no bites so far. 

Going to my dream school is extremely important to me and I'd really like to be let off the leash a little bit (for reference I wasn't allowed to go to public restrooms alone until I was 16). I have multiple contacts around the school I want to go to and I've visited the area before. 

I understand that my parents don't *have* to do anything and it's there money so they can decide if they don't want to send me somewhere. Currently my mom is pushing me to go to another state school where 90% of my high school goes and is not particularly known for its academics. I would have to live there so that's kind of a plus for me and they at least have my major but it's probably the absolute last place I would choose to go. 

So I figure my options are either get my associate's, get a job, be extremely frugal until I can afford where I want to go on my own (probably at least 3 years before it's feasible and I'll be eligible for more aid). Or just go where they want me to and do what I want later in life (this doesn't really feel like an option, I've been doing what they want in my 3rd choice of major because they didn't approve of the others and I'm feeling pretty done).

I am an art student at a smallish public university. I don't pay tuition because of financial aid, but I am in ~5k of subsidized debt because I lived outside my means my freshman year. 

I really hate my living situation. Basically i live in a 2 bedroom apartment with 2 other people - my mom and my sister. It's a really small apartment. My living situation is a daily downer for my life overall. I hate it.

I also don't really have a social life. I live like 14 miles away from the exciting part of the city. I don't have a car, and public transit here sucks balls and doesn't run at night. At school I talk to people and have some friends but don't do anything with them outside of school. Most of it is because I can't (because of the no car situation) and the other half is out of habit of not socializing in the first place. 

My art program is also really small. The faculty here are good, but I have problems connecting with the students. Not to mention I go to a commuter school, so the on-campus activities are limited to football season and whatever clubs don't meet during the day. 

Basically if I can just fast forward the next two years of my life then I'll be debt free with a BA. But life doesn't work like that and I just hate it where I am. Where I am right now is literally working against me on determining what to do with my life so its a money vs. opportunity problem.

887,[deleted],1426445248,/r/college/comments/2z5btl/changing_my_major_and_chasing_my_dreams/,"Greetings and salutations, my friends.

I am turning to you in a dire need of assistance. Namely, I have gotten stuck in quite the rut. As a university student, I've naturally been having many troubles regarding my studies, but as for the grand problem that has been haunting me for a good while now I'm pointing out an insidious desire to abandon my current studies, therefore to procure a change of my major.

I've been studying a joint mathematics and computer science program for three years now. In all this time, I've achieved little progress in regards to the succesful completion of my exams, and have had an inconsequential degree of self-imposed research of the topics correlating to my field of study. I would have had many thoughts in the past of abandonment than I dare count, but my stubborness would always prevail, leading me to a change of premises on the matter. Nowadays, I'm unfortunately finding an unsfurable dullness to my lectures, and just the act of being present at the aforementioned lectures brings me great pains, and leads me to feel a fool.
Thus have I – despite all my best efforts and intentions – quite recently indeed passed the relieving decision to relinquish my ambitions of obtaining a mathematics degree. Before I outline what would it be the major that I'd then wish to declare, I will want to display what have been my reasons of entering this faculty, and of what nature have been my successes, such as they were:

From a young age, I have had many an interraction with computers, making me glad of the comforts of the modern age I lived in, as many would I dare say agree with me. I loved the joy of discovery, of experimentation, and of the solving of logic puzzles. I have then naturally been led me to a high interest in mathematics throughout grade school and middle school. However, straight A's don't necessarily mean a higher-than-normal aptitude for a subject, so alas I'd have quite a weak success in maths competitions, and more often than not I would need an assistance from private tutors as I found my understanding at the school lectures to be unsufficient for a further proliferation of my mathematical understanding. Entering university, I was intensily struck with the stark difference between college and high school maths, but I still proceeded forward. Unfortunately, I am a much sicklish individual, and my chronic illness would beset me in a debilitating state, leave me inpacatitated for months at a time, nullifying any progress I might have achieved in my maths studies, leading me to incur a forgetfulness of much of what I had knew afore, and progressing me further behind my peers in my lectures. My state had become better, but I can't ignore the fact how I have been led me to a twice-repeat of my first year. Luckily, my university has been more than understanding of my condition, and I did not have a pay for the repeat. Regardless, it doesn't negate the fact that it has led me further away from mathematics, no matter how many times during summer would I rediscover the joy of discovery in mathematics, and successfully instrument on my own a proof of a formula or a theorem. I have always comforted myself with the fact how mathematics and computer science are one of the fields most in demand, and how I would always have a job with this degree. But nowadays it is as if I've lost the mathematical mind, and problems that I could solve with ease before have become intensily difficult and dull, even the programming ones.

On the other hand, I've always had an immense love for literature and deep thought. I would always relish in self-reflection, and ask myself many hard questions. As soon as I learnt to read, I remember picking up Tolkien's Hobbit, and completing it several times in a row. That's when I knew I wanted to make it my business to read as much as I can, and create enticing stories and conclusions for my own behalf. I would enter writing contests and attend history competitions, at which I had much more success in comparison. I would enroll in drama sections, and I would be handed out main roles in plays. I loved typing; I would take a book, and copywrite a vast majority of it in my computer. Later on, I would become active on gaming forums and I would write content and articles, compose interview questions, archive data and links, and actively moderate my sections. Of course, all of this was pro bono, but I appreciated the chance the community administrators gave me, and it just helped me to further improve my writing skills. I wasn't always the most consistent, and I would have many breaks in such efforts, the longest lasting an entire year even. But I returned to writing articles relating to games on a more freelance basis, before I got accepted at a different community, and once even getting a paid job offer, which I unfortunately had to turn down due to my health becoming worse yet again. Now I won't argue that my writing efforts  were of any high quality, but at least as I matured, I could notice a marked improvement.

Ever since I've been enrolled at my university, I've moved away from articles, and instead I've been composing for my own satisfaction. The nature of my composition has mostly been journal-like, that is, I would describe my actions and thoughts in the manner presented here. But I would also find myself creating short stories, again for my personal enjoyment. What I find somewhat paradoxical is the fact how most of the composing has actually been done in my mind, and I would always remind myself how I would have to write it down before I forget, but alas I rarely do so. It is as if a strong fear is still gripping me, and if I were to give in myself to my inner desires, I have a feeling I would lose my own self. Still, at times I get an irresistible desire to just write, and were it after a dream in which I would experience the most unusual sensations, and even find myself reading prose in my dreams, – or were it rather while I'm solving problems, and a sudden inspiration strikes me, I find my hand moving of my own accord, and recording my thoughts.

In recent time, I've felt an even stronger pull for writing, perhaps due to the fact how I've been trying to forget my aspirations, taking it for foolishness, listening to idle and mean voices. It is as if someone has attached a string to my heart, and is nudging it ever so firmly each time I ignore my inner self. I've lied to myself for too long, and I've managed to comfront myself and prevent a further suffering. I understand it now how mathematics (more specifically, computer science) may not be the path for me, no matter how much I might have wished it to be, but I would rather have to then turn to my other big love and interest.

I understand how to be an author or a writer, one not necessarily need a degree, but it doesn't negate the fact how I wish one for myself, hence arising the question of what major should I pursue. In truth, only two fall to my mind, those being philosophy and languagues (or literary studies).

When it comes to philosophy, I hadn't realized how much love I had for it until recently. It had also been one of the things I've been trying to ignore, colouring it again to be foolish and listening to the doubts of my associates, but as to not repeat myself too much, I've decided to discard the opinions of the skeptics. Nowadays, I'm enjoying in the classics, and I've mostly been studying Plato and Descartes for now. I'm relishing in their arguments, and I'm drawing out papers of my own accord. I've taken an introductory class to philosophy, and I'm enjoying it immensely. I believe if I were to pursue a degree in philosophy, my options could be varied. For example, if I were to stay in academia, I could take in the study of logic and epistemology, and perhaps even return to my study of mathematics. Or I could take a study in ethics, and I could write about the morality of modern conflicts and war, for example. If I were to work outside academia, I believe I'd prefer a freelance or self-employed position. Or I could finish another major (where I live, double majoring isn't really possible, but I'd rather go for a double degree; a time consuming effort, one that I'm not entirely sure would I like to pursue), and combine whatever skills I were to obtain from studying philosophy to that other discipline. Or I could hope to build a programming portfolio, and strike a junior coding position.

English not being my mother languague, I've always strived towards obtaining a better understanding of it. I wish to obtain a truly commendable ability in my knowledge of the languague, thus hopefully making it ever so easier for me to compose prose. Having this line of thinking lead me thus to consider philology studies, where I would declare English as my major, alongside with a minor in German and Arabic. However, I am uncertain would I enjoy languague studies more so than studying philosophy. I view this matter currently as this: I could always study languagues in my free time, but if I were to focus in philosophy, it would serve to my personal betterment in a more diverse fashion. It's funny how many people tell me the exact opposite, how I could always study philosophy in my own free time, and instead focus on more a marketable major.

As you can see, I've questioned this matter extensively. I have displayed a sort of a portrait of my interests in this self-reflective study, leading me to hope it will help the composition of your comments when you take these facts in consideration. Thank you in advance for the time you might take in reading and responding to my doubts and offering your suggestions and opinions.

*TL;DR.* I thought I loved maths and compsci, but I was wrong. I wish to pursue writing and academia, so I'm considering between philosophy or languagues, despite what all the doubtful voices may say.

The basic foundation courses (i.e. Drawing, painting, color theory) are ok, but beyond those, I feel that the majority of college is fairly meaningless. 

But why do I go in the first place?

I'm a dirt poor college student, so the money greatly helps me out a lot. It's also hard to find work without a car, and I can't afford one. I don't live in a major city, so public transportation is a joke. I'm also in college to buy time as well, and at least gain skills and pay for things (i.e. art instruction books, because they don't teach *everything* an artist needs to know at school, especially at a public university). I do receive enough grants to cover my entire education, which is how I can even afford college, but also take out loans for family expenses.

I am in a program called the Mass Transfer Program which is basically if I get a 2.5 GPA I get automatic acceptance to any state school and if I get a 3.0 GPA I get that plus a 33% tuition waiver. I have a 2.7 GPA (was getting used to college and didn't do as well as I could have) and I can definitely get it up over a 3.0 but that still leaves a lot of worries.

The school I want to go to is (all numbers are rough) 24,000 a year with dorming. I need to go for 2 years so that is 48,000. After the 33% off tuition it will be probably around 45,000 and I do not qualify for any fafsa support money because my parents earn too much and I can't get a work study on campus because I have a loan through my school not a grant (just under 5,000 a year). I will probably get another loan through the school I want to go to but they give a max of 7,500 a year. That leaves me with again a rough number of 30,000 I need to come up with not even including a meal plan or textbooks. 

Where the hell do I come up with that? I could get a personal loan through my bank but those max out at 25,000 and I would need a job through college to pay for the interest or I supposed my parents could make the first few payments but even that leaves a floating 5,000.

Since early 2013, I've been suffering with a lot of indecision. I was going to college and—being the subpar student I've always been—I ended up dragging my GPA down low enough that I no longer qualified for Financial Aid. This was a huge dose of reality that I needed.

I was able to pay to take another class and take it seriously enough to bring my GPA back up. After that, I decided to take the time to work on getting a job for the first time.

I have several friends who are doing things with their lives and are able to do things for themselves and I feel as though I've just been freeloading off my parents this whole time.

I'm an American currently living in China teaching English. The pay is decent and it's a nice life. In order to work legally here, you need a Bachelor's degree; but they're not too picky about what it's in or where you got it from, you just need it for the bureaucracy. I know some people just boot up Photoshop and make themselves a nice fake degree, but I didn't feel right doing that- also, you can get in big trouble if you're caught.

Instead, I paid to attend a one-year online Bachelor's program from a little tiny school in the nation of Montserrat. Degree sorted. Got the job. (I also went to an actual college here to learn Chinese, and have a certificate of fluency for that.)

But here's where we're at now: I just turned 24. That means I finally, finally qualify for some government aid (long story short: no parents' tax info, couldn't apply before). And that means I might be able to get a degree that's actually worth the paper it's written on, should I decide to return to America at some point.

So, denizens of Reddit, I turn to you for aid! Here's what I've got:

-A good high school GPA and SAT scores

-An admittedly accredited but probably not valuable Bachelor's in Education from Montserrat

-An ability to speak and read Chinese

Here's what I'm looking for:

-An American school that will let me transfer some credits

-And it has to be 100% online, I can't exactly fly back home on weekends

-Preferably in some field that won't trap me in a full-time job the rest of my life

Thank you.**

I'm on the verge of my 20th birthday, currently in school in Chicago studying something I'm only honestly mildly interested in. I chose this path because in high school, I convinced myself I wasn't good at anything but the extra curricular I was doing after school, which was working tech crew for the theatre department, so now I'm in school studying to be a set designer. Honestly, theatre is not for me. I don't really enjoy plays and musicals like my peers, I can't rattle off lists of my favorites and I don't sing showtunes, the persona of actors and directors disgusts me, and I don't know how to read a script and put the idea on a stage. I don't think these are things I want to deal with in my life. That's a shitty career plan.

But I went and convinced myself that I was going to be a set designer and that I was going to love it, so that's what I focused on and I thought it was going to be great, but as I've been in school the past year and a half (I'm a sophomore now), I realize I don't think this is right for me.
Honestly, I think I want to be a tattoo artist. I've got the artistic talent, I could just use to better my skills. That, in itself, could be an option to just switch my major since I'm already in an art school, change from a theatre design major to a fine arts major, develop my skills, then go out for a tattoo apprenticeship. That sounds like it might be a solid plan.

The major issue is, I don't want to be in Chicago anymore. For a lot of reasons. I'm from here, and staying here to go to school was not my first choice. In fact, it was worst case scenario, and here I am. I wanted to go to school in Seattle since high school. A school there was my top choice (albeit for the same major I'm studying now in Chicago) and I was accepted with flying colors, but my parents ultimately made the decision for me to stay at home. I'm an only child and I guess they were selfish and wanted to keep me around as long as possible.
During my miserable freshman year of college, I made the effort to apply transfer to the school in Seattle, who reaccepted me basically on the spot. I felt like I was really going to go and live my dream, and then I let insignificant things stand in my way and keep me from going.

This past fall semester, school was going fine for me after choosing to stay in Chicago. I thought, alright, this is how it will be, maybe I'll choose to move after I've graduated. But recently, my personal life took a huge turn for the worst. I, foolishly, thought I had gotten myself involved in a potentially serious relationship over the past year, and was suddenly told differently when he decided I wasn't what he was looking for, and he didn't love me, despite stringing me along for nearly a year. This was very, very recent, and I'm still reeling from this situation, which is honestly really devastating for me. I just feel like I can't even be around him anymore. I don't want him in my life and I don't want to go to the same school as him, I don't want to be in the same city as him, I want to be as far away from him as possible. I wish I'd never even met him but because that's not humanly an option, the next best thing is dropping my entire life and leaving. Part of me always wanted to, but now I feel like the flame has really been lit. This was my last straw. There is absolutely no way I can ever be happy here. I need to make myself happy somewhere else.

Part of me just wants to drop out and move and not even bother trying to transfer schools and rack up more student debt. Tattoo apprenticeships are not cheap, and do not count as educational institutions, so I would have to save money or take out a private loan.

I fear disappointing my family by leaving school and moving away. My dad's family is very old school and would not really approve of what I'd be doing. But I have to think about how much that matters to me, because it's important that I make myself happy while I'm still young enough to do it. I feel like I'd be disappointing my faculty advisor, who is the professor for the majority of my classes relating to my major. She sees a lot of potential in me and I don't want to disappoint her, although I'm sure she'd rather see me succeed at something that makes me happy than to continue pretending to do something that doesn't. I'm also not the most important or groundbreaking student she's ever seen. It wouldn't be that big of a deal for her. She's not new to this.
I also fear I'd be making a huge, huge mistake if I go and can't find a job, hate school (if I end up transferring), or not be able to even find a tattoo artist to take me in as an apprentice. I'm not sure how to lay these things out and decide which is most important to me.

Adding to that, I was selected to go on a trip to Prague during this upcoming summer with other students in my department to attend a quadrennial exhibition on theatrical design. I was so excited, it sounded like the experience of a lifetime, but now I'm feeling I don't want to continue in the program, which would make the trip obsolete and a missed opportunity, but if I do go and decide after to not keep going with school, it would be a waste of my time and money, and someone who deserved more than I to go on the trip would get my spot.

I feel like I should continue out the semester, but that's another $5,000 in student loans plus interest I have to pay back on a degree I don't even know if I want. I thought I had everything figured out, and now everything is upside down. I'm not even sure how to start figuring it out. I don't know how to bring it up to my parents.

896,[deleted],1422182636,/r/college/comments/2tlsbe/doubts_about_cc_and_then_some/,"Hey there, /r/college. You've probably all heard this one many times before, but here goes. I apologize in advance for the upcoming Great Wall of China of text. Brace yourselves.




I'm a 2014 high school graduate. While I always loved learning and was in AP classes, my utter laziness caused me to barely graduate high school, and now I haven't any choice but to go through CC if I want to pursue even a semblance of anything like a  higher quality education, which I absolutely do, both for reasons of personal intellectual fulfillment and because I don't want to be almost certainly stuck as working-class wage slave for the rest of my life. The kind of job I have right now just won't cut it for me for the approximate next 70 years of my human existence, assuming there aren't any complications along the way.




But I digress. You reap what you sow and my actions (or lack thereof) have landed me in CC. Now I'm fully aware (perhaps a bit grudgingly) that this isn't necessarily a bad thing, as my local CC is one of the best in the nation and easily rivals some universities in certain aspects (not so much in many others, but you can't win everything). So while it's less than ideal (at least to a teenager), CC won't be a death sentence for me like it would in other places, and, financially, it's a sound idea, as my parents won't/can't contribute a penny to my tuition costs, and I don't have a couple thousand dollars to throw around for CC, let alone a good 20-50k/year for actual University. Ergo, this could all be a blessing in disguise, strictly financially speaking, since I haven't got the means to pay for college nor the luxury to waste time spending it superfluously trying to figure out what the hell to major in.




So here I am, bittersweet, half a week into my first semester of CC after a semester's break (7 months total) fresh out of high school to earn money via underpaid, mind-numbing labor, and, frankly,to get a bit of a break from school after 15 continuous years of it (I started young). Despite the wisdom in going to a good CC for someone in my position, I can't help but feel a bit sad and regretful of ending up there, for relatively superficial reasons. I see all of my friends shipped off to places near and far, living in dorms with their roommates (for better or for worse), all in one building with friends and foes and crushes alike, going through the ups and downs and all the antics that come with being a freshman, and I feel like I'm missing out on some fun times. While I understand that dorm life isn't all it's cracked up to be, I still wish to go through the experience of it, to make new, long-lasting friendships, and experience the independence and learning that comes with the ""college experience"". While the fact that I am now left here, with all my classmatess and acquaintances gone in and out of state to schools, while I stay behind a counter and greet the faceless entity of customers 5-7 hours a day, is entirely my own fault, I still wish to live that social aspect ASAP, especially after being deprived of any interaction with anyone within 5 years of my own age for nearly 8 months now. I'm lonely. I didn't really have any friends before, more just acquiantances, but now my interaction with people my age is at 0. I don't get to be independent, I'm still stuck with my family. I love them all very dearly, and they're all great, but I feel so suffocated. In all 19 years of my life, I've been with them. I've never  really had much of a social life. I want to get out, to meet people. To get drunk for the first time, to pull all-nighters, to feel the stress of exams, to learn all those little life lessons, to make long-lasting friendships. Right now my life is this boring, monotonous loop, and I'm alone in it. 



So, with all of this (most likely gratuitous) babbling done, I have these questions:




What is the quickest way to get out of CC and into my university of choice (which requires the wonderful range of 12-36 credits for transfer, I'll shoot for 15+ because I don't have some relative that will pay for most/all of my tuition, and I have a grand total of roughly $1600 under my name), without rushing it and doing more harm than good? Please consider the fact that in all my years of school, the extent of my studying ended with the school bell, so I don't have any study skills whatsoever, thus making me take 5 classes/semester right off the bat a bit too ambitious of an idea to be of any benefit to me.




Ultimately, does the opportunity cost of saving a few thousand dollars outweigh the lessons and experience learned through an early and true college immersion? (I understand that this is nearly entirely subjective, and that's perfectly fine.)



Is ""the college experience"" really all it's cracked up to be? Can a transfer student still live that lifestyle and experience that iconic chapter in life fully with a maximum of 2 years to experience it all? What would be the best course of action?



And finally



Should one even go to college, at all? Is it even worth it? Honestly, nowadays, it seems like less and less of a good idea to go to college if you aren't 90+% sure about your current path in life.



I just can't help but feel regret at this point, yet I am also well aware of the rising costs of tuition, or of the danger of mindlessly abiding by the somewhat misplaced cultural idea that  no college= no success, especially in today's globalized economy. I understand, rationally, that CC is actually becoming more and more of a wiser option, provided your local CC isn't absolute shit, and/or you aren't absolutely certain about what you want to do with your life. I get that. But there's that whimsical side of me that's slipping into a depression because I'm deprived of all social interaction,  drudging through each day where the person nearest to me in age is a 30-something alcoholic, lest you count my 13 year-old sister. I want to make friends, I want to find myself, as I don't even know who I am. I want to forge strong relationships, and have the opportunity to meet many people of different backgrounds, and the chance to thrive intellectually and be humbled by those superior to me in that aspect. Being a hostess at a restaurant is hardly conducive to rich, fulfilling intelligent conversation. I'm just bored of life right now. Bored of the daily grind, the colorless monotony of it all. And if not through college or travel to some faraway place, where else will I find a place where young people just like me are clustered together, united under a common goal?



Sorry if this got melodramatic/preachy. I'm just utterly bored, and unhappy, and want to get out of it ASAP. ",college,"Doubts about CC, and then some",http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2tlsbe/doubts_about_cc_and_then_some/,1422200636.0

So, I was supposed to have FAFSA fully cover my time at a local community college for 2 years, and then I was planning to transfer to a better school, normal stuff I think. I was told I had $1,200 for books and whatnot, I even just got my card in the mail that I believe I'm supposed to use to purchase books (mind you it's a week late and I was already doing classwork) so I figured they had my FAFSA money and would automatically use that for payment for the classes. I don't understand what happened at all.

So I have to ask, what did I do wrong? I can't call until 8:30AM and it's 1AM. Is this a mistake on their part and do I have a chance to get back into my classes? Every semester matters to me because I already feel late and behind the curve since I took time off (don't take time off, by the way)

898,syntheticocean,1421682236,/r/college/comments/2sxxun/advice_for_going_back_to_school32_years_old/,"I'm strongly considering going back to college in the fall. I'm 32, and struggling. I currently work as an administrative assistant and I can see it is a dead end road. I make ~$32,000/yr on an hourly pay rate. I have a building trades certificate but that field does NOT do well in the Phoenix part of the country due to every contractor hiring illegal immigration for 1/4 what we should be getting paid, so I left the field. However I'm in need of some advice by people who can guide me.

What Majors are beneficial for a 2 year degree? I may take more than 2 years but at my age, 2 years is a good start I think. I'm scared of the financial aspect behind all of it considering I'm struggling as it is and racking up student loans on my current salary is going to suck. 

I'm considering something in Accounting. At my age I can't go for my 'dream job' and I recognize I need to bend to fit the needs of the world around me. I've always wanted to do computer programming, and I had gone into the field in the past but I failed miserably. I couldn't wrap my head around it no matter how hard I tried. I need something a little less complex, yet very rewarding. I was thinking accounting because it can help both in career and in your financial life at home.

This is a scary thing for someone my age. I currently have about 1100$ in bills a month, and I only make about 1700 after taxes. So financially at the end of the month I am tight when you count in food/gas. I can't really afford to make any more mistakes. I have $0 in retirement and its beginning to look like I will never retire.

900,babyturd,1421293936,/r/college/comments/2shat3/is_transferring_to_university_even_a_possibility/,"I've had a rough time these last 5 years, well 8 years, basically since I graduated high school. I'm not going to try and make excuses though, I just want to know if there's really even a point in going to school anymore for me. 

I've been to school on and off for like 5 years. God it's so horrible writing it down. I have a 3.0 GPA with 58 units completed...and 91 attempted. This has disqualified me from any financial aid. I have quite a few F's in my transcripts with a good chunk of them retaken already and quite a few W's. I went to a financial aid workshop last semester to appeal for financial aid since I was going to need it for some time june this year. At the moment I'm getting my classes paid for by a BOGFW, but I can't get any loans or pell grants. In the work shop the lady said I could go to another community college and since W's and old F's don't transfer(according to her), I could get financial aid at that new school. I guess I let my naivety get to me.

I decided to try it out and go to another community college just a few miles further. I transferred all my transcripts, registered full time, and did everything I needed to. I got an email today saying that I was denied financial aid from FAFSA. Man, I felt so shitty after that and got me sad, but also opened my eyes a bit. I called the financial aid office asking questions, but the lady on the phone was no help. I went in person to the financial aid office and they said that I wasn't eligible due to my old grades and being over the limit. I also brought up that I saw in this website (https://studentaid.ed.gov/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized#eligibility-time-limit) that the unit cap doesn't apply to unsubsidized loans and if I could apply for those at least. The person basically said ""Nope"" and that's all. Do any of you have info on this?

So, I got an appeal form and I'm going to start gathering any evidence I have that I'm in need and why I messed up. Basically I had really bad depression and anxiety caused by living with my mother. Living with her was a nightmare and caused me to fail my classes. I only have one shred of evidence of ""extenuating circumstances"" and that's from an emergency psychiatric place that took me in and gave me some meds for depression and anxiety. This was also exacerbated by the fact that I used to be morbidly obese (not anymore). I found a place that would take me in and let me live for free and did that for about a year and did awesome in school and lost weight. Then eventually my time ended with them and I couldn't receive aid to pay for rent due to my past grades and had to move back in. The cycle continued and eventually I said fuck it all and ran away. I called my dad, he called my uncle, and he let me stay in an old trailer in his back yard. I called the department of health and services and applied for emergency food stamps and medical so I could buy food ( my uncle simply provided habitat, which I am thankful for, but I had to fend for myself). I lost all the weight I had regained, found a job and saw a therapist for a session. I was to embarrassed after that first session. I bought a bike and started riding everywhere. Now I'm in a much, much better place than I've ever been in my whole life, although I'm very poor. This was all about a year ago and my uncle is going to let me stay until June this year and I'm not receiving food stamps anymore, where I will have to move out and fend for myself completely. I've saved some money, but it's going to be a real struggle. If I have to I'll get private student loans.

I'm going to contact that psychiatry place and see if they have any records, hopefully that will help. I'm going to put the fact that I was receiving food stamps and basically write down my story and hopefully they can help me. I don't have very many things in official documentation which is my worst fear. 

Even if I do end up getting aid, with the amount of F's and W's I got, will I be able to transfer even if my GPA and class requirements are met? I'm planning on going to a CSU that isn't impacted for my major (computer science). If I can transfer to a university, will I still be ineligible for financial aid at a university?

Senior in college here and I just have some basic questions that I need a third opinion on. 

Some important background info: 

* I'm in my last semester here, graduating in May. 

* I have a boyfriend who lives 3 hours away that I dedicate two weekends to per month. 

* I plan on studying for the GRE this semester

My boyfriend suggested that I don't get a job this semester so I can focus on studying for my classes as well as GRE. I can't really take a lot of jobs because a lot of them require weekends. 
My parents pay rent and tuition, but I also have a car payment to take care of and don't want to ask them to pay for that in addition to groceries and gas money. 

If I were to take out a student loan, I was considering taking one out for ~$1000+ from a provider outside of my school. 

Has anyone else been in a situation like this that can give me some advice? Should I just suck it up and try to find a weekday job or is getting a loan worth it?

904,[deleted],1418845643,/r/college/comments/2pltvo/some_questions_i_never_received_a_degree_and_am/,"I don't know why I'm even posting this...probably because I can never even get a hold of a single god damn person at my school for advising/counseling, and can't make appointments with them given my work schedule.  

Awhile back, I attended Lincoln Tech for electronics engineering (big fucking mistake that was) - didn't get all the way through due to very hard times living on my own in the middle of a ghetto, had a job at the time, and cut my losses.  $14,000 in debt for that piece of shit school with nothing to show for it.

I joined the military not long after that.  Got some great experience in a highly technical career field, tech school, etc.

Got a great job right out of the military when I came back to the states.

Long story short, I don't have a GI Bill, so that's out of the question.

Decided to go to school for programming at a local community college since I was doing software QA and lighting system technician type work at my job, figured I'd stick with the industry given my experience with it. 

I hate programming.  I am an absolute master of everything else computer related to be frank, so programming was the only thing that would have been new to me to take classes in (IT and networking would have simply bored me) so I went for it.  It fucking sucks.  Programming is just not interesting to me in the least, but I had to get out of the (decent) but dead end job I was stuck in (long term contracting position).  I also didn't want to go for electronics engineering for (the 3rd) time, since my tech school in the military was just an accelerated version of the same exact crap I learned in Lincoln tech.

So I have no formal education.  Out of nowhere, I just got a job that I'm starting January 6th - awesome regional field service position and it's a lot more of a technician spot which I like.  I'm a mechanic/technician first and foremost.  From completely rebuilding vehicles (like the 2 I have now) to building computers/guitar amps on my spare time.  The job pays pretty damn well at $60k (where I live that's pretty good money), it's a full time position with full benefits and a brand new company truck/laptop/iphone.  There's a lot of growth potential there as well, and not just as a field service tech.  I no longer feel it's necessary to throw time, money, and effort (none of which I have any to spare) at a bullshit degree anymore.

I finally called it quits about 2 semesters in with this degree I'm pursuing after just getting absolutely fucking fed up with the lack of communication and crappy classes that I learn absolutely nothing in - these are like little kid classes for me.  I feel insulted to even have to take them, and I still get shit grades because I simply don't give a fuck or have any time or effort left on top of work to put forth into it.

So do I pick it back up once I get into my job for awhile and see if I have time to do some more online classes?

Do I cut my losses again and just pay back my loans and say that's that?  

To say that I was going to use the degree later on towards a bachelor's would be kidding myself.  Another $20,000+ down the fucking toilet for shit grades that I could barely make?  I don't think so.

So this would just be an associates.  It would be the first fucking thing in my life I fully accomplished - but is that really worth the rest of the $8,000 that I'd have to pay for the rest of the degree?  

Is it better to be $16,000 in debt with nothing to show for it, and try to stick with this new job for the long haul and never need another degree, and save myself the time, money, and effort?

My resume has been good enough with my experiences to land 2 jobs so far that only bachelor degree holders are able to get - I am **beating the system**, and I love it.  I just don't know how safe my future will be without some sort of degree I guess...

For the first year they required me to live on campus, which I did. I did great in my classes, had ample free time for studying/extra work, etc. 

But I'm paying myself. The loans for school are all going to be on me when I graduate. Because of this I figured I should move into an apartment and work to pay rent so I didn't have to pay off the on campus housing along with tuition after graduation. Since I already had a part time job near campus (downtown), I just upped myself to a 50 hour work week and signed a lease. I thought I could handle it.

This was at the start of this past semester. I quickly toned my work weeks down to 40 hours because I overestimated how much I could work and still do well in school.

Fast forward to today. Finals week was last week. I did fine enough in all my classes, I suppose, except for one, which happens to be the only class I took that was really difficult at all. The rest were basically review, but I straight up failed this one. I just didn't have the free time or mental energy to put in the required effort. 

Prof understands my position and is trying to help me retake things but as I'm leaving tomorrow for Christmas and my grade is below 50% (I've never gotten anything lower than an 80%) unless I do perfectly on everything I redo (which I won't), I won't pass.

Sorry this is long winded. TL;DR: my chosen field is so oversaturated with aspiring audio engineers that the amount of effort I have time to put in on top of working to pay rent isn't nearly enough to get me a job ever, but since my loans are deferred until I leave school I can't drop out without being slammed with payments on top of rent I can barely afford as it is.

Advice?

I'm seeing a lot of kids here who are worried about/have already failed some of their classes. No doubt there are many more who are reading those posts and are in the exact same situation. I'm currently a senior studying Computer Science. I don't have a 4.0 GPA. In fact, I too have failed/had to drop about 4-5 classes myself. But I've gotten things turned around and would like to help you do the same, so let's talk.

First of all, like many of the freshmen posting in here, high school was really easy for me. In fact, aside from a few classes, I would say college really hasn't been that hard either. I honestly didn't learn anything in high school. I know everyone here says that but it's especially true for me. I cheated on every single assignment in high school....like literally every one lol. Don't ask me how, but I always got the solutions manual and just copied answers (with some purposefully wrong ones thrown in so I wouldn't get caught). Then, using whatever insight I had gotten from that, I would go into the exams and make straight A's. I'm telling you this because I know how confusing it is when you then do terribly your first, second, and maybe even more semesters during college. Anyway onto the guide...


---Have you already failed? ---


Talk to the professor and ask for extra credit or if you can make anything up. Yes, on every syllabus it says not to do this or that it is pointless. Do it anyway (you have nothing to lose but your apparently misplaced pride). Most professors copy half the rules on their syllabus from another syllabus because they are lazy or the school tells them to. When I was taking calc 1, I saw that all my online homework was really hard...so I didn't do any of it. At this time, I didn't know everyone else was getting 100s on every assignment because they were using wolfram alpha. At the end of the semester, I had a D and needed a C- to pass and move onto Calc 2. My professor, let me makeup ALL my homework assignments (giving me 100s on all of them) when I completed a little ""mini test"" he made up and let me take home. It was about 10 questions long. This won't always work but every once in a while it will really save you. If you still have time to turn it around on the final, some of the upcoming study tips may help you.

---How to make sure this doesn't happen again---


1) Time and effort &gt; genius
You've probably just realized this now. Consistent work not only leads to better grades, but also leads to easier grades. Tests (even finals) will be very low stress for you if you already know you know everything...obviously. 

2) All-nighters are for college noobs
Another thing that is pretty obvious. What I am saying here though is this...if you know that you are going to cram for this test...that's fine and all but do it before you have to pull an all-nighter. If you don't know already, if you take an exam without sleep, it has been shown (by numerous studies) that you are basically taking the exam drunk. If you have to do any kind of reasoning/math/problem solving for that exam, it can (in many cases) be better to just watch some quick youtube vids of the concepts, focus as hard as you can, and go to sleep thinking about the topics instead of pulling an all-nighter. Sleep is a critical part of learning since it cements the concepts you learned that day. If the exam relies on you knowing and recalling a series of facts you wouldn't know any other way but by pure studying, an all-nighter might be necessary but this is honestly quite rare. I have not pulled an all-nighter in 2 years now. 

3) Do not take drugs to improve performance
Many people swear by study drugs but these people are fools in my opinion and everyone else deep down kind of knows it. This is sort of the same thing I did in highschool. Find an easy ""hack"" to get through an already easy curriculum then get destroyed on the next level. College is nothing important in and of itself and it is really only as hard as you make it for yourself. Rather, it is what comes after that you are preparing for and that will be the true challenge. If you still have to take drugs to do well in the work world, things will unravel quickly. Even if you made the grades, you will know that you are competing against people that made the same grades as you the legitimate way. You will know they are either geniuses, hard workers or both. That insecurity will eventually bleed out and undermine you.

That said, many people say it helps them focus on getting the work done. Of course, this can easily backfire. One of my friends took a drug that was supposed to help him focus on studying. He ended up spending hours concentrating on making a perfectly sculpted papermache penis. Another one of my friends pulled an all-nighter and took caffeine pills right before the exam. He told me that he started shaking during the exam and then threw up on the paper he was writing on. You don't want your body to experience 500mg of caffeine for the first time in its existence when you are taking a huge final. Rarely will drugs save you at the last minute from an entire semester of slacking. Trust me, you don't need them to keep up with everyone else who is using them. 

4) Go to class, even when the professor is bad
Most kids (especially freshmen), learn that one of the most joyful traps in college is that you can finally skip your classes if you feel like it. After all, you will just learn what he taught in class that day from the book, and he is a bad professor anyway with a terrible accent so it's probably better this way anyway right? EVEN IF you actually went back later that day and rigorously learned everything he taught (but lets keep it real...) it still wouldn't be worth it. Lectures are more than just a time to learn. They also provide you insight and information on the person who is going to be judging your performance. You will know how much he expects of you (or how little). You will always know what you should study before the exam (which kind of helps) and when the exam is (lol). Some professors enjoy only announcing important dates, assignments, and exam ""hints"" in class. They drink the tears of those who thought they would be a decent human being and post the same stuff on the course website. Trust me on this. Some asian guy a long time ago once said to keep your enemies closer to you than your friends. If I had actually learned history in HS I would know his name.

5) Don't ""study"" for problem solving exams
Really, it is too boring and slow to be effective. Reading your book, taking notes over the material and ""understanding it"" will work for a lot of classes but it is not the best way. On the classes it doesn't work , you will wish you had ebola so you could call in sick on the final. 

Whether you spread this out over the entire semester like a good student, or cram at the last second, you should focus on solving problems instead of reading explanations. Even if you don't know anything, go to the problem set first and begin solving it. As soon as you get stuck, go back to your resources, find what you need to know to continue, and move forward. This will naturally show you what you don't know, what you do know, and how it should be used. As students, we know that the temptation to watch netflix at the worst possible time will never leave us. However, since your mind will be more actively engaged doing this, instead of just highlighting entire chapters from your textbook, you will find it more bearable. The only willpower you will need is to get started.

Again, nothing helps you learn faster than raw application. It is tremendous practice for the exam because you are getting immediate feedback on the mistakes you are making. Thus, when you see a similar problem on the exam, you will remember the mistakes you made when you practiced the problem, and will avoid them here when it matters. That is exactly why that problem is there. The professor saw kids making mistakes on that type of problem all semester and put it there to see if they have adapted yet. With any luck, your peers will blindly stumble into these traps (while complaining they ""studied"" for the exam) and force the curve :)

6)Study a little for fact-based exams
This usually happens in your soft electives. Introduction to American History, Introduction to Art History, Introduction to Basket Weaving, Endroduction to being Interested etc. If you have to write essays make sure you actually try on them. That will give you roughly the same results as practicing with problems, since you are applying your knowledge. Otherwise, you really need to think about how the facts relate to each other and why they are important. These classes are usually easy and can help you pad your GPA. That makes it extremely important that you go to class anyway since there you will learn exactly which group of facts you need to know and in what context. This severely cuts down on study time as you won't be studying things that won't be on the exam (you know this is a big problem if you have ever skipped a lot of classes).

7) Don't rely on the curve
You can pray for rain or pay someone who claims they can bring it, but there is no guarantee it WILL rain. In very hard classes, a lot of kids will justify their poor grades by saying ""It's a hard class he will have to curve"". That may or may not be true. The reality is that even in very hard classes, there are plenty of people who are (a) geniuses (b) hard workers (c) know a guy with last years final (d) cannot afford to lose since they will be deported if they fail (e) lucky and so on. Trust me when I say that in the day of your disaster, these kids will somehow line up all the stars, come through as a group and pull off the academic equivalent of the Miracle at the Meadowlands all to your dismay. 

8) Never study in groups
Unless you find that l33t hidden study group with the 4.0 geniuses where you can l33ch like mad, this is worthless. The only function these serve is that people ""agree"" to study at a particular time for a certain duration where normally they wouldn't. Even then, you will be dealing with mostly incompetent people who either don't make themselves useful, or feed you the wrong information. Remember, in a group you can only move as fast as the slowest person. 

Unless you put together a solid team of SEALs (Super Elite Academic Lords), you will find that group study is the ultimate white kid's pipedream. How many asian gods do you know who rely on group study? Are you really going to rely on Johnny the Stoner to understand the intricacies of computing that took Alan Turing his entire life to discover? Trust me, weed isn't THAT enlightening. Even if Johnny is a theoretical comp sci God who has a diagram of a pushdown automotan as a bumper sticker on his car and swears he ""only programs in Lisp"" because he ""likes the challenge"", it still won't help you for him to basically give you his own personal solutions manual. You can't apply that now, or on an exam. If you are applying your knowledge as your professor assigns the homework assignments, and before the exam you will be completely fine without a group. This advice goes for tutors and TA's as well. Having someone help you may be necessary from time to time. But at the end of the day, it is college, and sometimes you need to just put on your bullshit boots and wade in.

I can use all the excuses I've had this semester between family issues, unemployment jerking me around and other menial things, but it all comes down to pure laziness. I'm currently using the Post 9/11 GI Bill and I'm now scared shitless because I'm not confident that I'm going to pass at least one of my classes. I'll have to pay out of pocket for any classes I fail and I can't even afford that right now.

This isn't cry for support, nor am I looking for kind words. What I am looking to do is ask that all of you, whether you are 18 and fresh out of high school or older and in the same boat as I am take a moment to evaluate your performance. Don't discourage yourselves if you're down. Realize your mistakes and work to fix them next time.

I find that almost *every time* I go to do laundry, someone will take my clothes out of the dryer right after I leave the laundry room, then put their clothes in and re-start the dryer and run the whole cycle so their clothes will dry, then put my sopping-wet clothes back into the dryer when there's 1 minute left in the cycle so I end up having to pay for another. I don't want to have to guard my laundry, but it seems like thats what I'm going to have to do because I always end up having to pay for two dryer cycles because the first cycle always gets stolen. Running the dryer for one cycle costs $1.25 and takes an hour, and so far I've had about 12 cycles get stolen. That's $15 and 12 hours of my life that could have been used for better things. I shouldn't have to pay for other people's laundry and I shouldn't have to guard my laundry, but since our dryers don't lock I really don't know what else to do. Does anyone have any good tips to keep people from messing with my laundry and stealing my time and money? Is there anything I can use to lock the dryer so people will leave my clothes alone until they're dry? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, and thanks in advance!

My dream came true when I got accepted to a university a little over an hour away from my hometown. I got a full tuition scholarship for all 4 years. It was great, with my pell grant and scholarship my parents are only having to pay ~$500 a semester out of pocket.

Things weren't going so hot the first couple of weeks. I felt really alone because I had a hard time making friends and I was pretty sure I didn't like my major. I went home every weekend and one time I cried as I drove back to school because I didn't want to go back because I was so miserable.

Things started looking up about a month in, I made some friends, I changed my major to something I love, and I started going home every other weekend instead of every weekend. It was fine up until about 2 weeks ago.

I don't know if I'm just depressed or if I genuinely hate being at school. All I can think about it how I wish I had chose to go to a two year college then transferred for my last two years. I'm only taking 12 hours so I don't really feel overwhelmed by the work load. I'm not homesick either, or at least I don't feel like I am. I do hate living in the dorms.

I'm kinda leaning towards taking the semester off and getting a job then applying for the community college in the fall.

914,[deleted],1412727801,/r/college/comments/2im2si/im_miserable_at_my_university/,"I don't want to do a throwaway here, so I'll just say that I go to [pseudo-Ivy League college] in [American city]. 

Here's some quick background: This is my freshman year of college. I applied to several different schools and was accepted to three: State School #1, Trade School, and Pseudo-Ivy League School. Even though I desperately wanted to go to Trade School and become a mortician (it's been one of my biggest dreams), I chose to do nursing at Pseudo-Ivy League school because a) the academics are incredibly hard and b) the opportunities are incredible for graduates. Also, I got a better financial aid package, and I'm not about to take out huge loans for mortuary school, since it won't really pay off in the long run. 

Basically, I hate it here. 

First off, let me tell you what I DON'T hate: The nursing program is fantastic and I'm absolutely loving it so far. I want to continue on doing nursing--kind of. These days, I have been questioning my school choice. I have been waking up every day going ""why didn't I go to mortuary school?"" and ask myself that continuously throughout the day. If I had to leave this school for any reason, however, I doubt I would continue pursuing my secondary dream of nursing. I am also doing fine academically (getting a B average, which is acceptable for both the parents and me at a school this tough). 

However, I just dread getting out of bed and facing the day. I am generally miserable all the time doing anything school-related; I don't hang around in study sessions, I don't form study groups, and I always study alone. I have a few friends, but I generally tend to stay away from people because I have gotten a seriously negative vibe from others here--which was NOT the case at the other schools I was accepted to and visited. I have partied but I don't really enjoy it, so that's off the table. Hell, I have problems leaving my room on weekends--I just want to curl up in bed and not see or deal with anyone. I hate doing clubs (I've tried tons and have found no passion or interest) and, as a result, have picked up two jobs that I actually really enjoy doing just to get away from the school. I really, really try to expand my social circle, but I have been constantly let down and now just feel jaded talking to new people. I want to be alone, but I feel so lonely as a result; I often find myself mulling over this and crying. 

I have no idea what to do at this point. Should I transfer to Trade School and pursue my original dream? What if I flip-flop between that and nursing, though? (Mortuary science is, predictably, not a major at Pseudo-Ivy League School.) Is my problem even my major or is it just social adjustment? I'm so confused and it's just making me even more frustrated. 

TL;DR went to second-choice school because of better financial aid; stuck in a place I absolutely hate and want to leave but can't because I enjoy my major/afraid of losing my awards package and having to pay more.

My family only offered to pay if I went to BYU, so I went and they put me on a track where I can only attend in the Winter (Jan- April) and then the Spring (April - July), so I started late. I ended up coming home for the Spring because my family lost their home in a fire so I took the semester off. So my first year, I was already behind 2 semesters. Now, I've been going to school part-time at a local community college (2-3 classes per semester) and working part-time because I can't afford to take any more classes than 2 or 3. I never went back to BYU because I am not Mormon (my family is) and I couldn't handle being at a religious school where I couldn't be myself.

Throughout high school, I wanted to be an English major. I took AP English Language and AP English Literature. When I started college, it flip flopped many times, and now I've been taking core classes to enter into a Nursing major. I know I would be happy in that field because I love helping and caring for others and I would make good money, but I would much rather study English. Though, I know how tough it is for English majors to find work after college. I just am not as interested in the biology and math classes I'm required to take for Nursing. They feel like a burden more than something I really want to study. I know if I'm already feeling this way now, Nursing school will be a million times worse. I can barely bring myself to study because the classes don't interest me. I also wish I could put my full focus on school rather than work, but that isn't an option.

1) When I first came here, I weak and naive. I got taken advantage of and was sexually assaulted. After this, my self-esteem plummeted even lower than it already was, and I did many things that I regret and am not proud of. On top of that, I actually slept with a guy who was in a relationship- I didn't know it at the time. I found out afterwards, but still, all the blame got pushed onto me . He blamed me saying that I begged him to sleep with him (completely untrue). But she bought it, and she told all their friends about me, and they still harass me for it every time I see any of them. I really regret everything but I can't undo it. And I feel depressed a lot because I'm constantly reminded of everything that I just want to push out of my mind. Plus I feel so angry and wronged that I don't know how to deal with my rage, and it consumes me.. To the point where I sometimes can't concentrate when I'm studying and just want to break everything around me. I really just want to stop letting this affect me. Plus, I really want a fresh start. 

2) Every since I was in the seventh grade or something, I wanted to move out of my state. The reason I worked hard in school was so I could move away, this was my drive. All my friends knew this and my parents knew this. When it came time to apply for colleges, I applied to my dream school, a few other schools I was not particularly interested in, and two in-state schools- One was back-up, and the other, the one I'm currently at, which is the school my parents wanted me to attend b/c it is 2.5 hours drive from home, while still highly-ranked and I only have to pay in-state tuition. I got into my dream school, but at the last minute, I accepted my offer for this school b/c I suddenly felt afraid to be too far from home. I always wonder what it would be like to be at that school though, and now that I feel more mature and experienced with life, I would love to reapply and see if they'll take me.. Or at least go out of state like I had always wanted to do before. 

3) I hate how my school lacks school spirit. Sports games have low turnout, in fact, I rarely hear people talk about them. Half the students here commute. Aside from the occasional party (which I have no interest in attending due to being sexual assaulted at one), the campus is so dead on weekends- Like in order to get food, I have to walk 20 minutes to the campus village where I can choose from 7 places.. All school-owned eateries are closed, even the student union building is closed on weekends. Many people who live in dorms are in-state, so a lot of them go home for weekends. Both my parents went to a college known for school spirit, and I had always imagined my school like that. 

I don't completely hate this school though. If I were to stay, it would be because it is generally pretty competitive, and I like that. I'm afraid of going to a school where most students are underachievers and only care about partying. Also, I love the beauty of this campus- my dorm has an ocean view, which is incredible. I really do appreciate this.

931,11tracer,1394383393,/r/college/comments/1zz2z3/looking_for_some_advicecommuting_vs_living_on/,"So I've run into a bit of a dilemma. My parents have had a big hand in supporting me through college financially for a while now. However, they are cutting off all of their support after this semester ends. It sucks, but they're not as financially stable as they used to be. It's become clear that I will have to start taking out loans, but there has been one choice I still have to make that I can't quite decide on. I was wondering if anyone with a bit more experience than me may be able to help.

I can't make the decision between living on campus or staying at home. I have been living on campus for the past year now, and aside from the awful drunken party atmosphere on the weekends, I have been loving it. I love being on campus at all times, not just for class but for spur of the moment things like needing to meet with a professor or TA for help. For context, I my house is about an hour away from campus. I also feel like I'm a lot more productive without spending two hours on the road each day to and from school. I know it sounds silly, but I'm not a very proactive person, and I like having that extra time getting the procrastination bug out of my brain without worrying about wasting another couple of hours of my day driving. 

The catch is that room and board plus a meal plan basically double my college bills, meaning I will have to take out more loan money. Yes, I have considered being an RA, and that just isn't an option for me. I am horribly socially inept as is, and being responsible for and taking care of a bunch of college kids makes me panic just thinking about it. 

There is also a catch with commuting-I don't own a car. When I'm home I use my one of my parents' cars, but using it to commute to school every day just isn't an option. Looking through used car ads it seems like I could get a car for as low as a couple thousand dollars, but I'm concerned about how long such a cheap used car would last me. For more context, as of now I only have a few thousand dollars to my name(enough to get a used car and have some left over), and I work a minimum wage job full time (usually 5 days a week, varying hours) when I'm not taking classes. Gas prices don't seem too outrageous(maybe around $800 per semester), and it all seems to come out cheaper than room and board plus a meal plan. However, I haven't factored in maintenance and insurance, so that could possibly push it over the limit. Considering the large immediate expenses, I would probably have to work while classes are in session. This is the prospect I like the least. Spending two hours on the road each day and working-that takes away A LOT of free time for getting school work done and just generally relaxing a bit. I stress myself out about school enough already, and I'm afraid that cutting down on my free time like that will only make it worse. 

I'm looking for some second opinions-and maybe some advice from people that have been in similar experiences. I'm not sure what would be more financially sound: spending most of my meager savings so that I can take out less loan money while sacrificing a lot of free time in the process, or just taking loans so that I can have a less stressful college experience and pay them back later. I really, really want to continue living ton campus but I'm not sure if it's a good idea in the long run. One more bit of context, it's looking like I'll have to be here for around 3-4 more semesters, and I'm majoring in computer science, though I'm still working out exactly what I want to do after I graduate.

933,[deleted],1392585722,/r/college/comments/1y36x1/anyone_ever_drop_below_half_time_with_stafford/,"Alright, so, I'm super stressed out!

I normally take 9~14 credit hours, depending on the semester. This semester I only took 7 (2 classes) because of a slew of important personal reasons.

I did not receive a Pell Grant this year, but I did take out a little Stafford - a little less than half of a full award.

My problem is that I need to drop one of my classes worth 4 credit hours. This will drop me below half time.

Before you try to talk me out of it.. 

* Please note that I'm a 4.0 student with over 45 credit hours, looking to transfer to a good school.
* This class started with 30 people, a month in it's down to 11. I keep watching in amazement. How many will be left by drop date in a month?
* The teacher does. not. teach. and asks very random stuff on her tests. The book and youtube does not prepare me for them (I'm usually good at self taught with bad teachers).
* This class was a science elective, I don't need it for my major.
* I've *struggled* to keep a borderline A (around 90%). Every week my average goes down even though I study more. I'll probably end up with a high C, and then get nailed on the timed final that is 60% of my grade. It will tank my GPA. I promise, I will not get a A in this class. I doubt I will get a B.


That said, I'm worried about dropping with Stafford. I keep googling and reading different things that can happen. I can't call my school until Tuesday.

My school *does* send me a letter every semester telling me I have Satisfactory Academic Progress, and that I'm well above the percentage enrolled to keep aid. If I were to drop this class I would still be above that percentage just fine.

So here's some things I'm worried about that may or may not happen.

* If I drop to 3 credit hours in the middle of a semester, will my loans go into repayment in 6 months (from the exact date I drop)? Will summer school cancel this out? I don't normally go during the summer, but I'm willing to to catch up on my credit hours and/or keep my loans in a safe place. What if I wait another month to drop (at drop date) and then Fall starts back up in 5 1/2 months?
* My school splits and disburses Fin Aid in 3 payments. I just got the first one, I'll get another check in March, and another in April. Think they'll just not give me those checks at all?
* Will I need to pay back what was already given to me?
* If I need to pay back or they stop disbursing, would I get the remainder or whatever I paid back during the summer?


I know I need to talk to my school personally on this. I guess I'm just looking for any personal stories about people who have done this to calm my nerves and/or prepare me mentally before I do. I'm the type of person to just stress and stress and stress.",college,Anyone ever drop below half time with Stafford?,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1y36x1/anyone_ever_drop_below_half_time_with_stafford/,1392603722.0

And they can't smoke it anywhere else outside because the university is in middle of downtown. I also told them to smoke it at their friend's dorm but they come back and smoke it in my dorm because it's more ""convenient"".

I told my RA that I need to transfer rooms because of the noise and I can't focus my academic work and sleep schedule. I didn't tell him about my roommates smoking/vaping weed and other drugs because I don't want them to get kicked out of school.

 * 2) That I won't be able to afford it.  I can't quit my job -- obviously -- since I have people depending on my paycheck to help pay a chunk of the household utilitles.  I have some government loans already from the first 4 years of school (which have gone into repayment)
 * 3) That I'll fail...again.  My first time through, I did well the first 3 years.

1. My parents do not contribute at all to any of my college expenses, and refuse to do so. 


2. I don't qualify as an independent student (not married/over 24/don't have kids/not a veteran) , so I can't get enough money in federal aid to cover even one semester of college. 


3.  My parents divorced early in my college career. They are both barely squeaking by with paying for bills and fees because of this. But because their yearly income is around $50,000 each, FAFSA determined that their ""estimated contribution"" is around 7k apiece. 


4. I work almost full time during the school year, but still don't make enough to support myself and pay for school. 


5. I can't take out private loans because I don't have high enough credit for it yet. 


6. My parents can't cosign a loan for me because their credit is fucked because of the divorce. 

7. I've applied to around 100 scholarships over the past year, and haven't gotten a single one.

**EDIT**: On the advice of many people that replied, I just got back from an appointment with a financial aid officer, and very good news. They reviewed my financial aid award and told me that I actually had three potential options: I'm supposed to have my mom fill out an application for a Parent Plus loan. If she gets accepted, I'll be able to receive up to 12k in federal unsubsidized loans per year! If my mom applies and is denied (which she probably will be) I'll still be able to receive about 10k in loans/grants per year. I'll also be counted as an independent student for financial aid purposes. Also, it turns out there was a mistake on my FAFSA that led to me getting waaaay less aid than I should have. The question asked whether my mom had any 'investments'. She thought this included assets as well, and told me to put in 75k. Turns out, that amount is what her house is worth, which doesn't count as an investment.

With college tuition now leading in the nation's debt with the growing amount of 830 million dollars, we are stuck asking: Why is the college-loan system failing? The College Bubble was a term used to explain the effect of the nation's current financial crisis and college tuition constantly on the rise. That is creating the bubble of debt that will eventually burst. College tuition rates have skyrocketed up 29% in the last five years. The average school year for a standard four year, for-profit college now costs $27,293 and on average only two out of three students are graduating due to not being able to afford their college education.

During the beginning of the recession, many industries felt the collapsing of the economy, industries like that of the stock market, real estate and even oil! All industries but two: healthcare and colleges. During this difficult time, colleges are prospering at student's expense and graduates are not seeing the benefit. This makes the expenditure of college and the hard work of graduates, a poor investment.

Colleges are charging too much for an education that even with government aid and loans cannot be affordable or paid off by a graduate in this struggling economy. The college loan system is failing students due to an endeavoring economy, over college spending causing higher tuition rates, depleting wages and declining job market. College tuition and the loan system that is in place to fund it must be modified to compensate in order to lower student debt. 
	College tuition has obviously risen to unmanageable amounts for college students, but why? It is due to the college arms race. Colleges are currently spending huge amounts of money on their campuses and recreational activities in order to encourage more students, which also means more money. Ohio University economics professor Richard Vedder was quoted saying, ""Every campus has [to have] it’s climbing wall, you cannot have a campus without a climbing wall""(McArdle). In 2009 alone, colleges spent a total of 10.7 billion dollars on construction of new facilities like gyms and nicer dorms in an afford to recruit more students. (Parker). Students will pay more money to attend a college that has a favorite college sports teams. When it comes to NCAA coaches, Brady states statistically that the average salary for a NCAA football coach was is $1.47 million in 2011, which in the last six seasons has climbed up nearly 55% (Brady). If teams meet performance goals, coaches will, in addition, receive bonuses. Such expenses made by colleges for sport teams, may be leisure for a student but how does this help them with a better quality education or with their crippling debt? Students are paying for something that in no way betters their education, just the notoriety of the college. Colleges have found many ways to capitalize off of their students in order to afford such expenditures. Some 4 year colleges require that you must be on campus for your first two years of attending with them. Room and board cost an average of $8,887 in the school year of 2011-12, that is up 4% since last year (College Board). It would make sense why they would require that you stay on campus, if it only put more money into their pockets. College books are another expense of students which colleges are benefitting from. Books are also required by colleges in order to attend classes and are not included in tuition. The cost of college books has tripled in the last 10 years, costing an average of $200 dollars (Parker). Colleges will publish their own books, require students to buy them, then update or revise them every year to make the book obsolete causing students to have to by new ones every year and making the resale of them, nonexistent! Colleges will work with publishers and receive kickbacks for using books they publish. Administration for college also feels the advantage of higher tuition rates. The president of Yale receives salary that has tripled from $591,709 in 2000, to $1.63 million in 2009 (McArdle). 
	Some experts argue that the rising cost of college tuition is due to federal aid programs. David Schnittger, aide to Education and Workforce Committee, argues that, ""The federal government should not have to automatically subsidize hyperinflation,” that ""there is no pressure on [colleges] to keep their rates down [due to government student tuition assistance programs]"" (Colin). What they don't take into consideration is that government aid is normally only given to low-income students. Middle and upper class students don't receive such aid. So how is it that government funded aid programs are to blame for the rising tuition costs? Now with the average cost of graduating at a 4 year college at $27,293 a year (Parker), it is easy to see who is truly profiting from an attending and/or graduated student. Colleges are capitalizing off students in a poor economy, and once out of college there is no guarantee employment will be waiting. 
	In 2008, Americans lost over 10.4 trillion dollars in the financial crisis. Between 2008-2010 over 8.3 millions of jobs were lost. The government tried bailing out the country with  4.6 trillion dollars and was only able to recover 1.1 million jobs, .9% percent of jobs. That is 4 million dollars in cost for each job recovered (Parker). Boyce Watkins, a finance professor at Syracuse University is quoted saying, ""[College] is certainly an investment. The question is whether or not you get your return on that investment in actual financial capital... [and] this blanket notion that going to college will guarantee you a better economic future is not always true""(Billitteri). In 2009, the numbers were at 12.5 million unemployed, which is 8.1 percent of the American population. The numbers have continuing to rise leaving the total count of unemployed at 17.5 million. With unemployment at the highest it’s ever been in the last 25 years (Katel), it's easy to see that even with the investment of college education, the job market is not in a state of stability leaving the college graduate to take minimal paying jobs, move trades, or move altogether to an area which is hiring. All of which is at a cost to them. 
Many people can't afford to move, so they need jobs to come to them. This is one of the least discussed, most challenging problems in the labor market right now...This is the largest annual jump in the number of unemployed since the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics began tabulating this data just after World War II. Most of the unemployed—62.3 percent—are out of work because they lost their job, higher than any point since 1982. (Boushey)
Some argue that college degrees do increase the likelihood of getting employment. The fields of healthcare, engineering and computer science have seen a sharp increase of employment within the last five years (Billitteri). However, are all students obligated to study in fields that are hiring so that they may make a high enough income to pay back student loans? If so, where will our educational teachers, earth science specialists and art specialists come from? Chances are these programs will lose funding. All these degree areas are feeling the economic downturn, does that mean that all students should have to pursue a degree that they don't wish to pursue, in order to guarantee enough income to pay back their student loans? Part of the American dream is to pursue what your passionate about, not to conform to the demands of society. Though some argue it is because of the student's degree choice, if all students were to graduate in a degree that was hiring, wouldn't that cause an abundancy of applicants? Making the job market for those jobs hiring like the rest, not hiring? College graduates not only face the outrageous cost of tuition but once finishing their degree they are stuck in a dead end job market which they cannot avoid. 
	With both college tuition and unemployment at record highs, it is not hard to see why the college loan system is failing. What once was the American dream has now turned into the national debt. With colleges spending too much on non-educational expenses and leaving their students to flip the bill in this economic downfall, it’s no wonder the college loan system is not helping the college graduate. The college loan system has to not only take into consideration the economy's state but the college's spending. While the nation is trying to recover and grow from the current recession it is important to recognize that student borrowing is working against our economic interests and the source of why that is happening. In order for the college graduate to pay off their debt, there must be employment after college and if that is not a guarantee, colleges must reevaluate their expenditures. Until the economy recovers from its current crisis, student debt will only worsen and end up not only costing the American graduate, but the nation as a whole.

When I sit down to do programming for class I feel like I could be getting paid for it. Not mention, the stuff I'm doing in my internship is much more interesting than the projects or homeworks. I graduate in 1 month anyway, if Reddit doesn't prevent me. Double major in math. It's been a rough 4 years to say the least. I got into some trouble freshman year and got kicked out of my dorm/school, quickly transferred right after the incident to a better school and dominated my sophomore and junior years. School was cake. Now, however, I'm plagued by even the thought of getting started and I wait til the last minute to start. I'm producing crap but still passing ±0.25 of the std. dev. so I'm not too worried, just tired of school. Honestly, at times, I feel embarrassed to be doing so well and trying so little. 

I've gotten some full-time offers but have yet to accept anything. Some offers are too far but pay well (80k) while others are close and pay average (60k). I want a lot of stuff so naturally the more the better. Living at home could save me ~12-16k/year but what fun is that. However, in terms for student loan debt, from what I estimate, I have more than the average student ~$46.5k but I've already paid ~$8.5k so I really have ~$38k left. I received tons of need/merit based aid too, went to public school, and took 4 AP courses in high school. It's retarded expensive to go to college, even if you do everything right like me ;)

Car has been having problems recently and I just found out I need to pay another 2k for the Fall semester since I dropped a class because of laziness and bc I didn't need it for anything, just an elective to reach full-time (12 credits). I lost a 2k scholarship that was already credited to my account since I dropped to 9 credits. Bullshit is that shit. Pretty mad about dat doe.

Thinking about buying a GTI too. Wicked awesome little cars. Have yet to test drive one but looking forward. That, or a 2013 audi/bmw Just can't wait til school is over and I get started at my job, save vigorously a few months (12-24), pay off all my loans &amp; get a nice ride to replace the POS granny-mobile 02 toyota solara I've been rocking the past ~4 years. Hopefully a nice car will impress easy-to-get girls. If not, I can still appreciate the german engineering....

As a bit of background, I am a high school senior with a 3.5 GPA (unweighted) and 1650 SAT score (1100 combined math/reading). My parents have told me that they are able to pay 10k a year for whatever college I choose to go to, so this divides up my college choices quite evenly. Either I dorm and take loans, or commute and remain debt free for my undergrad education. However, I am going to go for a B.S/B.A in Psych, and will almost definitely need to go further with my education and pursue a masters, (it may not be relevant but I'm thinking Occupational Therapy, which is a total of 6 years of schooling). After months of contemplation, I have decided that I would very much like to dorm and have the ""college experience"". My question to you Reddit is knowing that I will have to take out loans for my undergrad education, say 40k, (10k per year for dorming), will I still be able to take out more money for the two to possibly four extra years of graduate study? I asked several of my school counselors and surprisingly none of them were able to give me a straight answer. I received information regarding taking out money during undergrad education, so that's all fine and dandy, but when it comes to my graduate study funds I can never find a solid response.

If at the end of it, you will end up working in some mediocre job or living in the streets, why not get the same loan from a bank that you would've used for your art degree, and instead invest that into the stock markets, or maybe start your own business. 

Heck, my own uncle, who only finished elementary school, is a millionaire, because he owns a very successful bookstore business that he opened up by himself, being an immigrant to Canada, and ran with his wife.

If you can't (a) afford (b) don't want to go to college, or are just plain stupid, don't fucking go. Start yourself a sandwich business or something and get cash. I don't give a damn how much you like music. If you are THAT good at any of the arts, you don't need school. 

At the end of it, college is all about earning the credentials that say that you are someone someone else can hire because you know a certain number of things, which leads to getting money.

I understand going into technical schools, where if you save up, you can get rid of your student debt in 3-5 years, just by your paycheck.

950,zayg,1344016217,/r/college/comments/xmou3/at_a_crossroads_here_what_the_hell_do_i_do/,"Hey everyone. So I'm pretty much stuck with what I have to do. Here is my story.

Went to high school. Through high school I wanted do be an architect or something along the lines of that. All four years I took architecture related courses and decided near the middle of my senior year that I really didn't want to do it. Sadly, this didn't leave me much to work with.

Went to a small, commuter only branch of a state school (UNH Manchester). It was a decent price, although New Hampshire state schools are ungodly expensive compared to most. I decided to just go for business. After a year I decided I wasn't crazy about it, but I was going to stick with it. While registering for classes for my sophomore year, I was not able to create a schedule that would work with all of my classes. Commuter school = 3 of my required classes ended up being at the same time on the same day late at night.

So I never went back there. Decided I wanted to do something else and was pushed to follow my dream. Applied for an art school in Boston for photography and got accepted and even granted some scholarships. Still, I would be paying $25k out of pocket every year and was not willing to take student loans on something that would probably end up paying $20k a year. So - dream crushed.

Decided I NEED to go back to school either way. Looked into a community college in my state (NHTI) that I actually liked the atmosphere of. While trying to decide my major, I learned about radiation therapy from my bosses wife. It sounded pretty decent - relatively in demand, the field is active where I want to live (Boston), the pay is excellent, and it sure as hell beats a cubicle job. It was too late for me to apply for the program, so I took the suggested route and went into the general studies program.

Well, yesterday I had orientation. The head of the general studies program broke the news to me that to get into the radiation therapy program you need to fulfill a bunch of requirements based on points from classes taken. She told me that only 1% of applicants made it (thanks for telling me in the first place NHTI!)...so I don't have a chance of getting in next year. So I'm essentially looking at going to community college for FOUR years for this - and that is at the least. There is always a chance I don't get in on my SECOND application and I have wasted two years and two years tuition on nothing.

So I pretty much have no clue on what to do here. I'm almost 21 and I pretty much have nothing in store for me. I honestly can't take four more years (if not more) of living at home in New Hampshire. I don't have the money to move out and go to school on my own, I don't have the training to get a good job to do that, and I can't afford to go away to school anywhere that won't drive me nuts since room and board is so expensive. Should I just go back for business and complete that?

I hope someone can give me an idea.",college,At a crossroads here - what the hell do I do?,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/xmou3/at_a_crossroads_here_what_the_hell_do_i_do/,1344034217.0
951,aelysia,1343009512,/r/college/comments/wzt7a/i_want_to_cry_and_i_havent_even_applied_yet/,"Hi guys, sob story time. Whoop whoop. 

I'm going to be a HS senior this upcoming year, and finally had a 'talk' with my mom about finances (which she had tactfully managed to evade). I asked her point blank what she could afford, and asked her if she would run net price calculators with me. 

So we did. We ran tons of them; we ran the one for the state U, the state U flagship, some private colleges, and an Ivy for shits and giggles. I know these things aren't 100% accurate but I wanted to give my parents an idea of how much it would cost.

And guess what? Every fucking school costs the same out of pocket. The state U's will give no aid. The private colleges were generous with the aid, but they were more expensive to begin with. The 'cheapest' was UPenn, and I regretted to inform my parents that no, I am not Ivy material. 

The FAFSA was worse. My mom needed a refill on her wine when I told her the EFC's of each school. She told me that she can pay one year of these crazy EFC's, but no more. 

So what's a girl to do? Community college isn't an option. Commuting isn't an option. I'm glad that my parents told me I can apply anywhere I want because they all cost the same, but seriously, being middle-class in America sucks balls so bad. I can't wait to take out 75k in loans for my nursing degree. 

So yeah, just had to let off some steam. How are the rest of you doing it? @.@",college,"I want to cry, and I haven't even applied yet...",http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/wzt7a/i_want_to_cry_and_i_havent_even_applied_yet/,1343027512.0
952,sazzyoranger,1341691762,/r/college/comments/w6vhj/xpost_maybe_college_isnt_for_meconsidering/,"To start of, mine isn't the usual story where I'm either suffering from an illness or just fudged up by not showing up to class and failing (no disrespect to anyone who is going through it in that particular matter though).

I am in ways glad that I have an opportunity to attend college and took full advantage of it, but going through it was not an easy task. After graduating from high school at 16 years old, I decided that I wanted to just move out and live my own life, one that didn't involve my parents. The reason was that, growing up, I was neglected verbally and physically by all my family members. This created a mind-set that I just needed to get the hell out. So initially right out of high school, I guess college wasn't in my sights. This also affected my performance academic-wise from elementary through high school since I didn't tell anyone about the issues I faced at home. With that in mind, this effected my GPA in high school and ruined any possibilities of going to a good school.

It wasn't until I finally told certain people about my issues and what I intended to do. These people (who I consider and wish were my true family) got on me to go to college, some even threatened me haha.

So with their persuasion and advice, I moved out and started college at 17. It in no ways was easy though. Having to deal with a sociopathic roommate, financial issues, injuries, and illnesses, I pushed though 3 years of community college.

Recently, I got into a nasty car wreck that really set me back. I mean financially, physically, and mentally. It ruined a lot of things in my life the last 6 months. Even with that, I still managed to pass all my classes and get credit. I mean not having a car or to be able to work with my injuries for about 4-5+ months really hurt me.

So I guess to get to the point, after 3 years of community college I decide it's time to make the dive to a college or university. At community college, the costs were low...so my parents income didn't become an issue for me to go (fafsa related). I got accepted to couple of schools and I guess the situation now is that in each school I got accepted to, I still have out of pocket costs that I can't pay for. The reason being is that, I myself can't get approved for loans (I have good credit) and need a co-signer. I've tried to apply for loans with my parents as co-signers (well my dad since he handles the finances) and couldn't get approved since he has bad credit (gambling issues).

After so many years grinding away through college..trying to make the leap to finish at another school just doesn't seem like an option for me. Even after the scholarships and grants I've received... I'm just tired of it. Trying to push through knowing I have a huge road block to hold me back. I want to finish what I started but trying to do so isn't really in my future for the time being.

I'm considering take time off until I'm financially able to afford college on my own...or possibly wait till I'm 24 when I myself can personally take out loans (without a co-signer).

At this point I'm considering taking some time off until I can handle the financial part on my own. Opinions? ",college,(X-Post) Maybe college isn't for me...considering dropping out. 20/M,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/w6vhj/xpost_maybe_college_isnt_for_meconsidering/,1341709762.0

I'm now in hole to the school about 2 grand, without paying this I can't return to school. My academic career has been on hiatus for about a year now, and I desperately want to return. For the past two springs my parents have made empty promises about paying it of for me with their tax return, I'm unable to pay for the debt myself because I'm not even able making ends meet for daily life. This situation has left me in such a depressed state I simply don't know what to do anymore. I have huge dreams and I can't make them happen without an education.

954,[deleted],1338146907,/r/college/comments/u7lxb/thinking_of_going_back_to_school_for_engineering/,"So, like the title says, I'm about a year away from finishing my BA in Linguistics, and I've realized that I completely squandered my first shot at an education. I go to a moderately well-known/respected private school on the East coast, and since the tuition is comped due to an employee benefit through my father, the money isn't really a factor. 

The thing is, I feel like I've taken nothing away from my BA-- I studied Linguistics and Japanese, and while I had fun and made some good friends, I don't know anything about either and I've realized that the people-oriented fields I thought I was interested in going into have *no* appeal to me. The one thing I have learned, though, is that I want to *do* things, and make things, and solve problems, which I feel like my degree doesn't qualify me to do.

To that end, I've been thinking of doing half 'freshmen' courses (Calc, Physics, Gen. Chem) next year, and going back after I finish my BA to earn a BS in Chemistry from a state school and then try to find a master's program in Chem. E. or Material Science. 

The thing is, I can't tell if it's a _terrible_ idea or not. I'll be graduating from school debt free (no tuition, only had to pay cost of living the whole time), so the idea of getting saddled with a couple years of state school debt really doesn't terrify me, but what I'm worried about is how I can tell whether this is a nervous reaction to my impending future, or if I'm just going to flip flop again and wind up hating this too and just wasting time and money. 

So, r/college, how do I disentangle all that and figure out what I really want to be doing? I guess I'm just confused and need some advice on what would be a 'good' idea.

955,The_AntiPirate,1336348865,/r/college/comments/tadvh/well_ive_hit_a_wall_here_what_do/,"So here's some backstory, after wasting the better part of 3 years attending a college with a 15.7% four year graduation rate and only a 37% 5 year graduation rate. I've finally come to the realization that this is a fucking awful school, and probably contributes to my complete and utter lack of motivation here. I don't know why I didn't do this sooner since I've had it in my head for about 2 years that I was going to worst possible school I could have picked. Sole reason was beacause in-state tuition was pretty cheap and I would be close to home, regretting that a lot since now I have a ton of loans, a shitty gpa, and no interest whatsoever in ANYTHING that I could major in here. Doesn't help that there is no clear curriculum given, structuring sucks, the pre-requsite courses are not well defined and usually fuck people into spending 5 years there, and the advisors are generally unhelpful and not-give-a-fuckish.

There is one school that I want to transfer into. I'm trying to get into WIT in boston, had some friends who went there and I know it's a good school. They have the major I'm interested in, mechanical engineering, BUT they are no longer accepting applications for that major. Of course, it's been a bad enough month for me, I feel like garbage, I cut my finger off 2 weeks ago in an accident, now the only major that I'm interested in is the only major no longer accepting applications. Figures I don't come to the conclusion that I need to trasnfer to save my college career until the end of the semester when everyone else is pretty much done applying.

I can't wait another year, I'm already 22 and I'd be looking at another 4 years since not many credits would transfer. If I stay at my current college I'd waste another year of my life, drop my GPA even further, and accrue more debt. If I take a year off and withdraw from my current college, my loans will come out of deferment and I'll go into debt since there's no way I can pay those off. I'll never end up going back.

I am just completely out of ideas. I feel pretty helpless with all the bullshit that's been coming my way so far in 2012, now I'm walking towards the cliff were I fuck up a significant portion of my life or all of it depending on where the tides take me.",college,"Well, I've hit a wall here, what do.",http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tadvh/well_ive_hit_a_wall_here_what_do/,1336366865.0
956,[deleted],1336272442,/r/college/comments/t978b/sick_of_looking_maybe_reddit_can_give_me_any_last/,"hey everyone, i've been looking for any kind of financial aid for the past 8 months now. I'm technically a high school senior (although i did an early graduation in January and have just been chillin in brazil ever since). Also most importantly - I'm an international student


Anyways, i plan on going to a school called Slippery Rock University this fall. It's best thing is that it's considerably cheap compared to normal colleges. It's going to cost about 19-21,000 a year total for me. I have to find a job on campus or something to help pay because that price alone is still way too hard for my family and I. I see the school as a step-up from a community college though, and I plan to transfer to a really nice school if I can because all i want to do while at SRU is focus on good grades for the first 2 years.



However, no point in transferring or even trying well without a help in financial aid. if 20k is already really hard for my family, 45-55k is unthinkable.


I've emailed a ton of organizations and colleges. Every single one of them basically says the can't help. I don't understand how some of the organizations have ""success stories"" where i see they helped kids just like me, and some either insanely smart that go to stanford, or some that did worse than me in school yet still get full rides.


So i know this is dumb, but i thought maybe it would be just a shot. Anyone know of any other organizations i could talk to or colleges that  are basically known for giving a high % of financial aid for internationals?
