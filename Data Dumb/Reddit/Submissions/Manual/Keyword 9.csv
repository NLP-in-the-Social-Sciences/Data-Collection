0,Narguin2,1656058908,/r/college/comments/vjjhgb/how_to_deal_with_pressure_and_also_get_over_fear/,"I've been feeling more stressed out ever since I entered college. I kind of cruised through high school and didn't really feel a lot of intense pressure from classes except during my junior year cuz of some rlly bad family stuff.

Now that I'm in college, I feel like my world is falling apart every single day and the fear just keeps consuming me. I'm going to be a junior in the fall. I recently changed major paths and went from being a biology major to a stats major. Idk, with biology and my gen ed classes, they were similar to my experience in high school. It was tough and I definitely felt more pressure compared to high school, but things worked out and I never failed a class. Recently, I realized that I don't really love biology and I was only doing it with the hopes of getting into med school, but I dropped those plans because don't wanna spend ~8 more years in school and be hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. I mean I think I'm good at bio and chemistry, but I don't really love it and bio degrees aren't rlly known to get lucrative jobs unless I pursue higher ed. 

So, I switched to stats because I had some interest in it and I could get a lucrative career out of it. The problem is, I have a bad history with math. I always had math teachers that were extremely heavy-handed with their teaching methods and would go out of their way to publicly humiliate lower-performing students in the class. I was only a victim to this humiliation once, but being in such an environment just made me hate math and I guess I have some gaps in my knowledge because of this. I took calc 1 and calc 2 at my university and I just loved the way it was taught. Instead of being graded on just the answer like how it was in HS, I was able to earn partial credit for showing my thought process in addition to the answer. The professors also seemed much kinder and were more detailed in their teaching. I thought that perhaps I could make it in the statistics program.

Now I'm taking calc 3 over the summer and I'm in shambles. It's all online and my professor likes to ask conceptual questions. I understand their importance but I feel so dejected because I haven't yet acquired the mathematical maturity to know how to answer them. I was more used to the computational aspect of math and I just crumble when I'm met with the theory. There are some math symbols I don't recognize and I feel so dumb because it seems like everyone else does. Idk if it's because it's a summer course and I feel super stressed, or maybe it's cuz I'm just bad at math or perhaps it's both, which seems like the likely case. I can't afford to fail this class as I'm entering the major rlly late and the program has a gpa requirement. I can't drop the class, and I'm just scared because I'm a low-income student and I have to worry about the financial aspect of university life. My family is expecting a lot from me and I'm beginning to question my capabilities. I just feel like I'm going down a spiral and I'm crumbling under all the pressure.

Ive never asked for help from my teachers all throughout high school. I managed to figure stuff out on my own or read them off the internet. Maybe some of it stems from my social anxiety, but I know a big part of it is because I don't want to look dumb. My parents always expected me to just ""get things"" and when I would show signs of not understanding something, they would criticize me for being stupid. So far, I've never asked my professors or TAs for help in any of my classes throughout my college career this far. How can I get over this fear of sounding stupid? I think another reason I'm fearful of this is because I have friends who would gossip to me about students in their class who ask ""stupid questions."" They validate my fear that there will be people who think I'm stupid for asking questions and it just makes me feel worse.

Idk if any of this made sense. I'm sorry for all the rambling, but I'm in a high stakes situation and maybe I'm uncovering certain aspects of me that I need to mend and everything in my life is just stressing me out. I would appreciate any advice and first steps to fixing myself. Maybe even some advice on how to excell in calc 3 and ""achieve"" mathematical maturity.""",college,How to deal with pressure and also get over fear of seeming dumb?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/vjjhgb/how_to_deal_with_pressure_and_also_get_over_fear/,1656076908.0
1,SaadInHalf,1651442999,/r/college/comments/ugapw7/i_really_blew_it_please_help/,"This is a really long one- but please stick with me. I need some real help and I'm breaking down here trying to figure it out. I've written this much because the problem could be anywhere in here and I want the best advice I can get.

To preface, I was a high performer in high school (Class of 2020). By no means was I a particularly good student, but I was a high performer, and I've read tons and tons at this point on the issues that are associated with that/being labeled ""gifted""/etc. I never really had to apply a ton of study skills in high school therefore and never really had the chance to learn them. I was both smart and decently privileged, so anywhere that my smarts couldn't make up for the study skills, a tutor or my mom was there to catch me. I pretty much nailed high school with the exception of like one B in Senior year after COVID hit. Graduated with honors, wasn't valedictorian but that was fine, the kid who got it really deserved it.

In the summer leading up to college, I got accepted to my dream school, which was awesome, but a lot of family issues resulted from it. Toxic father who was abusive as both a parent and a spouse who insisted to pay for college for the sake of status, but also refused to pay for any school unless I landed ridiculous amounts of scholarship money... you know how it goes. Eventually we managed to get him to pay for my dream school, since I didn't get in on any scholarship and our blessed situation financially didn't really award any financial aid. I promise this becomes important later, just stick with me here.

Of course, because this was the summer of 2020, this is when COVID really changed the college scene and my school offered the option to go online, so naturally this is what I did since my whole family was really COVID-conscious. Fall semester comes around... and given how I started this, you're probably expecting me to say this is where I flopped, but truthfully, I actually NAILED first year. I even managed to develop all the work ethic and good study habits, along with having a thriving social life while at home! All As in primarily important pre-med stem classes with an extra elective I wanted to take. Only got an A- in the lab Gen Chem lab. I had the option to take Spring semester remote as well, so I did that.

At this point, a huge family crisis hit where we finally just hit the peak of the bs my father was putting my mother, sister, and I through, and he filed for a divorce behind my mom's back after she suggested they could file together. This became an incredibly stressful situation on top of being ostracized from an online friend group I'd been in for a year and a breakup with my girlfriend of three year at the time. My coping mechanisms weren't the greatest, but I trudged through the semester and did alright. Somewhat lighter course load, in all fairness, but all As and A-s, with one B+ from Gen Chem (which would have been an A if I didn't botch the final), so that's still incredible performance. In all fairness, I also made a lot of excuses in my lighter, less-serious classes that allowed me extensions on certain assignments and such, but that's still incredible performance and I'm not afraid to flaunt that. Ended freshman year on a 3.8/9 (depending on how you round it) GPA. However, due to the panic at the time, my mom really was panicked about that B+ in Gen Chem, so we decided it would be a good idea to get Organic out of the way ASAP, so I took it during the summer.

That was hell, but I came out with a B-, but my mom and I, being so used to how I was performing in high school, felt it wouldn't be a bad idea to just take it again during the school year since I've already seen the material once now and can just nail it next time, while also taking Bio and some other lighter classes (that would fit my now major, Psychology). It also was a huge hit to my confidence and momentum, alongside what I perceived to now be another huge pressure I needed to compensate for when I got to school in the Fall.

**Here's the juicy part. Sophomore year**

The divorce situation between my parents boiled on for the entirety of that winter semester, through the summer and fall semester, and finally ended during the Spring break of this past Spring 2022 semester. It only became worse and worse, and with my moving out, I wasn't able to handle it well at all, especially since on the big move-out day (remember I was remote that entire first year), my father trounced all over it by calling in his moving crew to move out to his apartment the same day.

My coping mechanisms with the whole ordeal were awful, and I had also recently rekindled my relationship with the girl who broke up with me during Spring 2021 (we found out a lot of our issues were based on gaslit misunderstandings from some 'friends' we had who hated what we had going on... we're healthier and happier than ever with each other now). So I was spending a lot of time with her over the phone trying to cope. At first, things still felt exciting and fresh and new. I renovated my room from the worst building on campus into something *AMAZING* (not to brag). My first couple weeks I was studying hard and good, but it all just started to catch up with me.

My work ethic just vanished. All that change I'd made and resilience I had to the family situation and other problems in freshman year just vanished. I was breaking down, I was skipping classes (which I had never done even *once* up until this point), and was doing so pretty unapologetically. I was suddenly having intense trouble grasping material well enough to do anything on exams, even when I felt just as confident as I would in freshman year before exams that I *aced*. I tried talking to on-campus counselors and therapists and they were nice but it just wasn't helping. I took courses from the Student Wellness Center to see what I might be missing, but I just couldn't do it.

I knew and know what I have to do but I just can't do it. I know I need to put in the work, but I've stopped studying diligently and regularly too. That whole first semester I didn't really even have close friends on campus aside from my roommate, because I became a shut-in, but in the last two weeks of Fall 2021 I managed to find some really nice people who I'm now close friends with. I even start making the walk to classes, then just sitting outside the classroom or building. It's right there. It's just another 50 footsteps away, but I don't go in. My confidence kept taking more and more hits as I'd mess up even incredibly easy classes. Fall 2021 ended with one A in a basically gimme-A class, a B-, and all Cs.

It's only during Spring 2022 when I managed to fix my issues of attendance and start actually getting up in the mornings consistently and going to classes and not just staying outside, and even now, my grades are technically doing even worse. I ended up with a midterm deficiency for my absences in one of my classes. I used standing witness in my parents' trial to skip out on some midterms whose credit have been shifted onto my upcoming finals. I don't want to be a bad student or a bad person but I really just feel like I somehow randomly am now. I really want to do well. I just can't find the drive, focus, or motivation to do any of what I need to do now. My semester is yet again looking like it's going to finish out on Bs and Cs, which, while not the worst thing ever, is certainly not gonna cut it for med schools.

I've made it this far, and even got myself together during my freshman year of college. I managed to overcome that typical gifted-kid burnout slump or whatever it is. I overcame my lack of study skills, time, management, and social awkwardness I had in high school. Then I move out to college after doing the first year remote with a few unnecessary hits to my self-confidence over things that really weren't big problems in hindsight, a bunch of extra problems on my back, and no ways to properly cope that are genuinely helping me.

*The interesting part of the issue here is not the same thing about high-performing high school students doing bad in college*. *It's about actually getting myself together after high school, nailing freshman year and not even feeling too burnt out, making one mistake (that I blew way out of proportion) at a bad time when everything else in my life comes crashing down, and now it's all gone.*

I keep feeling remotivated to try and try again but then two days after I get that motivation burst I just fall back into it all. I'm so tired and don't know what to do. I can't find anything on even remotely similar situations, but there has to be someone out there, right? Please. Someone help me. I'm so tired and scared. I'm not gonna make any huge life-altering or ending decisions so please don't worry about that. But just, please. Someone help me. I don't know what to do.

4,EagleAtlas,1617854840,/r/college/comments/mmjnmf/a_message_to_incoming_freshmen_from_a_senior_bio/,"The following is a list of tips that genuinely helped me over the last 4 years in university, and I hope some incoming freshmen can gain something from them as well. (Based on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/mmdid6/what_are_some_dorming_tips_youd_give_incoming/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share))    
    


1. **Go to your professors' office hours!**    

Try to make a habit of going to every one of your professors office hours at least once each week (even if it's on Zoom). This way they can learn who you are both as a student and as a person. That'll make it both easier for them to help you, and be more willing to help you (e.g. they may not take points/as many points away on quizzes and exams for topics they know you've been struggling with [this is not guaranteed, but I've personally experienced this at least one time every semester for the last 4 years]).    

Your professors want you to be interested in and learn the material as best as possible (well at least most of the professors I've had felt this way). If you show them that you're making a conscious effort to work hard and do well in their class, more than likely they'll reciprocate some, if not all, of that effort back into helping you. ""Helping"" could mean anything from spending a little extra time in office hours, to spending non-office hour days trying to help you through problem sets, to not taking points off for parts of assessments that you got incorrect (when other people would get points taken off for the same mistakes).    

(*Tangent*) Prior to COVID, I tried to make sure that I went to each of my professors office hours at least once a week. I started doing this for two reasons 1) because my father recommended it in our father son talk the night before my family took me to school, and 2) I felt awkward asking questions in front of large classes. Since COVID hit, I've personally found it harder to attend Zoom based office hours, even though I know I should.    

College can be incredibly intimidating at first, especially if you get stuck with rigid first year/semester professors. However, from personal experience, as long as you show them you're interested (even if you're not because it's some gen ed., just act like you are) they'll be very willing to help you. As they get to know how you learn and who you are as a person, they'll be able to explain things in ways that make more sense than they did during lectures/while reading the textbooks.    

2. **Try to sit in the front row of your class**, you might get picked to answer questions by the professor more often, but that will be an incentive to learn the material!    

3. **College is exactly what you make of it**    

College will be based on your mindset/outlook, and it will be exactly what you expect it to be, regardless of what your expectations are. 
*If you keep a nonchalant attitude, you'll see that even the most stressful challenges will come to pass. 
*If you came to party and chill, you'll have a great time... But try remember to submit your assignments prior to the night they're due. 
*If you're dedicated to working hard and trying to do the best you possibly can (i.e. me), it's okay to try and cool off every now and again, you don't need to work yourself to death before you even hit the workforce.    
The examples can continue forever.    

(*Tangent/Message to past me*) I can't tell you how many times I've heard this last point over the last 4 years, but it's true; I know that there are countless experiences that I let slip through the cracks because I felt as though I couldn't take a break from my work - do as I say, not as I do. If you're working hard, you'll do fine. So feel free to let loose every now and again, meet new people (literally, if you're given the chance to meet new people, do it; I don't mean just walk up to some random person with your hand outstretched and ask ""what's your name? My name's [name here]!"" that'll get weird looks... or pepper spray...), get out of the library/your dorm a every now and again if for no other reason than to get some sun and fresh air.    

4. **Try something out of your comfort zone!**    

This could mean answering a question in class, speaking to that person you find attractive, joining a club that seems interesting but deals with something you've never tried before, and the list goes on. However, this doesn't mean to try something that you find morally wrong, like if you're against doing drugs and alcohol, don't feel obligated to join in (peer pressure is not like it is in movies, or how high school taught it, but it is still a thing); but also, don't try to tell everyone that they shouldn't be doing it because you don't think it's okay (unless it involves hurting another person, then you have every right to speak up).    

5. **Don't feel shy, ask other people if you can hang with them!**    

If a person's door is open in your hall, and you see people hanging out, feel free to knock and ask if you can hang with them. If that group doesn't turn out to be your crowd, just continue this process until you find the right people. The ""right people"" may not be in your hall, or maybe in your building, just try to open yourself up to talk to people and you'll find your best friends eventually :)    

If it just so happens that you were the only one from your high school to go to your university and your feeling like an outcast, use that as your literal opening line. (Preface, in high school I was very shy, I wasn't against talking to others, but I struggled to initiate conversations with new people) This is how I felt when I first went to school, the last person from my high school that went to this university graduated 12 years prior to me starting. On my first day, I saw a small group of people talking and laughing together outside my building, so with the help of my father's words from the night prior, I mustered up the courage to walk over and just introduce myself. To the best of my recollection this is what I said (or at least something very close to it): ""I'm sorry for interrupting, but my name's Daniel. I don't know anyone so I was wondering if I could hangout with you guys?"" They welcomed me with open arms, stating that they were the exact same. That one interaction has stuck with me more than really any other, because it showed me that it's not that challenging to talk to others, you just need to muster up some confidence (even if, in the back of your mind, you're freaking out).    
    

All in all, good luck. This is a crazy world we're living in, who knows what could happen over the next 4 years. Also, if you read all of this, good job!

5,glitterpoot11,1568183288,/r/college/comments/d2lu3m/important_decision_about_my_senior_year/,"Hey all,

I’m in my fourth year of college after transferring to my local state university after two years. I’ve changed my major around 10 times and I’m still completely confused on what to do. I changed my major for the final time to political science because I already had the pre reqs completed for that and I just wanted to be done. While I like political science, we all know it’s harder to find a job with a poli sci degree.  I’m considering dropping out and pursuing my degree online at a later date or just getting an AS in CS which would take me a year at most (I have a lot of pre reqs done already). Sorry, the phrase “dropping out” isn’t in the title because it was auto removed last time but that’s what I’m considering doing. 

If I could do it again I would probably do MIS (I attempted that but it was too much extra time) or computer science because I’ve learned how to code and do data analysis in my marketing internship which I loved. But I can’t, there’s a lot of pressure for me to be done with school and start making money ASAP.  My home life is very difficult and I’m a commuter. This is also why I changed my major so often, I was rushed to decide and I was constantly stuck between my passion and what will earn me money (which later turned out to be something I enjoyed doing anyway). Right now I’m stuck with a poli sci degree and a lot of stress in a shitty home situation. 

I’m a first gen college student/high school grad so I have a lot of pride in how far I’ve come but I feel like I still won’t have much to show for it even if I graduate. The only thing is that if I drop out,  I’m sure my friends and family will be disappointed in me. I’m just not sure what to do. I know my future dream career (web dev) doesn’t exactly require a degree but I’m sure one would help. I’m sure I could continue studying on the side while I get through school but I’ve just been so overloaded with stress and depression that I feel like I don’t have time for anything after school and work.

6,lacroixalty,1533760002,/r/college/comments/95pppu/the_college_guide_for_poor_kids/,"hi r/college!

After browsing this thread for a while and also just searching online, I realized that while there’s an abundant amount of information and college survival tips/guides for the average college student, there’s hardly any for *actual* poor students and students of immigrants/first gen kids. After three frustrating years at Boston University, a seemingly progressive private institution that basically just discriminates against its lower income students, I decided to create my own guide as a lower income student who is a child of a single parent immigrant for anyone who might be facing the same experiences or about to enter college. Feel more than free to enter your own tips and/or experiences! 

1. Work Study: Most lower income students qualify for work study, and while its a good federal aid opportunity, I quickly realized after my freshman year that you don’t really get paid enough to live because there’s a cap on the amount of hours you can work, especially if your parents can’t afford to give you some spending money too. I recommend getting a second job if possible, and either working very little hours through work study, or forfeiting it altogether. 
2. Financial aid: You’d think schools would be more willing to help lower income students who are already enrolled but that’s just not the case. If you ever find yourself needing more money from the school, I highly recommend appealing for more (even if its a small amount). If they deny your appeal, keep calling the office. I have a friend who even emailed our financial aid office once and talked about his deteriorating mental health as a way to guilt trip them into giving more aid. 
3. Discrimination: The funny thing about my school (and probably all seemingly “progressive” institutions) is that they try to hide how discriminatory they are. This year, and every year for the past three years, I was “randomly” selected for income verification as were many of my other low income friends. Not very random if you’re only targeting low income students. Little things like this are the just some points of discrimination I and many others face every year at private institutions. 
4. Health Insurance: If like mine, your parents are immigrants and don’t qualify for health insurance, the odds are that your school will try to force you to pay for their student insurance plan. That would be fine, if said insurance plans didn’t cost thousands of dollars, which is kind of contradictory if you can’t afford health insurance, or tuition, to begin with. I didn’t realize until this year that there’s an easy loophole around this if you’re able to find a part or full time job that offers health insurance, which is helpful to begin with if you already plan on getting a job in addition or in lieu of work study. 
5. Housing: I lived in on campus housing for the first two years of college, and then decided to move off campus. Many other low income students I know fear doing the same because of student housing scholarships, which is fair, but what I’ve found is that living off campus is for the most part still cheaper than living on campus with a housing scholarship. If you also get federal aid, that money can also be refunded back to you to pay for the cost of rent. At the end of the day, paying around the same to live off campus and have your own room, kitchen, privacy etc will always be better than living on campus and sharing a room with someone in a dorm that hasn’t been renovated in 50 years. 
6. Friends/Socializing: This is one of the hardest things for me to deal with, because I’m constantly surrounded by middle class and to upper class kids who complain about how poor they are and how expensive school is. Yes, school totally is expensive. But I can’t pity someone who comes from a well off family when mine can barely afford rent let alone put me through school. (Seriously, I once had a girl complain to me about how her family makes 100K so she doesnt get any federal aid and so “in a lot of ways college is harder for middle class students than poor ones”). Its also hard when your friends parents pay for all their ubers and they can afford to go out almost every day and you can’t. My best advice is to not try to follow that lifestyle if/when you can’t. It sucks, but unless you want to work like a dog to be able to afford it, it really isn’t worth it. 
7. Parents: If you’re a first gen college student, especially if your parents arent from this country, there’s a weird phenomena that happens in college where you kind of feel caught between worlds. There’s the world of poverty you feel like you belong to, and then there’s the world of academia and security that you’re introduced to. In a way its alienating, because you can’t really even turn to your parents for guidance since they haven’t experienced it. You can’t ask your parents about motifs in *The Great Gatsby* if they’ve never read *The Great Gatsby*. This is actually still something I struggle with, but the longer I’ve been in school, the more I’ve been able to find people in a similar boat. We’re all sinking together. 
8. Major: This is similar to the above. There’s a huge pressure, once again especially if you’re the child of immigrants, to study something lucrative in college so you can make more money and rectify their choices/emigration. That’s perfect if you naturally excel and want to study engineering, but it can lead to so much anxiety if you want to study something related to the arts or humanities. My best advice is to study what *you* like and what makes you happy even if your parents don’t approve, because at the end of the day its your life. Additionally, it can still be difficult to pursue the arts in school because, at least in my experience, most kids who do study something in the arts are the ones who can afford to, meaning they have their parents to fall back on and pay their rent even if they dont excel after college. Or, their parents have the ability to help them out after school with industry connections. 
9. Student Organizations: One thing I’ve found after joining a fraternity is that dues are super high and you can’t always afford them even if you’re working. This is even harder if you can’t ask your parents for financial help, so apply for all the inter-organization scholarships you can, or try to talk to the leader of whatever organization you’re apart of about lowering your dues.
10. Textbooks: Split the cost with a friend! Check the university library because they often have a copy of whatever book you need! Then photocopy the book or ask to borrow a copy from your classmate and then photocopy theirs! Yeah its time consuming, but textbooks are super expensive and this is a virtually free way to get them. I haven’t had to encounter any online textbooks that *require*  you to buy them, but I would also talk to the professor of whatever course you’re taking and explain the situation. They’re a lot more understanding than the university as a whole.
11. Food: Ask your friends who have meal plans to swipe you in! Buy in bulk! Trader Joe’s is cheap and incredible! I also recommend buying groceries every two or three days instead of weekly to avoid waste of food and money. 
12. Mental Health: Even today its still kinda taboo to discuss mental health, and i felt weird mentioning that i go to therapy until this year when i realized a lot of my other friends do too. don’t hesitate to go, even though i know how hard it is to take the first step. More often than not, whatever insurance you’re on covers most or all of your outpatient costs, and if its still too expensive, most universities offer on campus licensed mental health professionals at little to no cost. One of the perks of being in a high stress environment. 

That’s all for now but I will definitely update if i think of anything else. Apologies if any of this comes off as bitter or spiteful towards anyone who isn’t from a low income/international fam, I love everyone regardless but it can definitely be isolating to only see middle class and upper class experiences discussed in both this thread and around you at school.
