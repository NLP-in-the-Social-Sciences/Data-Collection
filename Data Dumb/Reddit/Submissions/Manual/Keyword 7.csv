0,mallorylee,1663173842,/r/college/comments/xe6syl/got_accepted_into_a_nursing_program_but_cant/,"Long story short, I got accepted into a 2 year nursing program at a community college (Portland, OR)  
Tuition is $21k, and fafsa only offered me $19k. The program is Monday-friday, and class gets out between 3pm and 4pm.   
My monthly bills are $2100, and that is the bare amount I was able to get it down to. No subscriptions, extra things I don't need, nothing.   
My rent is $1125, car insurance $115, car loan 446, and the rest of the bills are typical ones like phone, electric, water, gas etc. 

I have applied to every possible private loan company out there and have been denied from all of them even though I have decent credit (754)   
Sallie Mae only will approve if I have a cosigner, and I do not have one. (parents said no, don't have anyone else to ask)  


I applied to every scholarship and didn't receive any grants. 

I honestly do not know how I am supposed to be able to afford to go to school.  
I understand that a lot of people work and go to school, however this is a difficult program, and I truly don't know how I will be able to work full time to cover my bills and be in class 5 days a week. It will leave me no time to study if I have to work during all the times I won't be in class.   


Is there literally anything that I can do?  
Has anyone else gone through this?",college,Got accepted into a nursing program but can't afford it,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/xe6syl/got_accepted_into_a_nursing_program_but_cant/,1663191842.0

Hey yall. So I'm basically a Sri Lanakn born in Italy.its in my birth certificate and my ID that my birth place is italy and the province I was born in.

My problem being due to the inflammation in Sri lanka I can't afford to pay for my tuition in universities. 10 usd in Sri Lanka can afford to feed a family of 4 for atleastly 2 days.sincw it's my last year in school I started looking for options. I saw this Swedish public school that has no tuition for students from Sweden and students from EU so was wondering if I'm applicable for this category. I already emailed the uni abt this waiting to hear thier response but I'd like hear some outside experience from anyone who has been in this situation. 

On context regarding my background my dad still works in italy and my mom used to too. But after my birth they moved to SL",college,Dual Citizenship,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/xe34x6/dual_citizenship/,1663182972.0

The train station is a short drive from my house and stops right on campus. Despitecthe commute being alright so far, I feel like I'm really missing out socially by not living in the dorms. I could possibly apply late for housing, as my college's dorms aren't filled to capacity, but simply put- I can't afford it. I'm paying my tuition by myself out-of-pocket, and the extra 10k+ would require me to go into debt.

 I am already acquainted with some people who live on campus and hope to meet more residents through them. My main concern is that I will be stretching myself too thin with commuting, classes, studying, work, and home responsibilities, and that I'll be hindered by being in the same environment I was in hs. It has been hard watching all of my friends leave and move into their dorms while I'm stuck at home attending a so-so college because I don't want to take out loans and my parents have no money to spare. 

I know in the long run I'd probably be better off saving now with the manageable commute, but I can't help but feel like I'm isolated from my classmates and miles behind my friends from high school who have all moved away and moved on.",college,Missing out by not living on campus?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/x6r235/missing_out_by_not_living_on_campus/,1662429325.0

I have been waiting 3 weeks to speak with my academic advisor tomorrow about the remaining courses that I need and what they think my best approach would be.

4,r3iddd,1661053199,/r/college/comments/wtpmp3/i_recently_moved_out_for_college_im_a_new_place_i/,"I moved out for college last month. I'm in a new state, hundreds of miles away from my family and friends. I'm broke, I have no one to hang out with here, and everything has been going downhill for me. 

I'm a part of the college band. I am the only girl in my section, and all of the others treat me as a lesser being. They're always putting me down, telling me I can't do certain things, and they talk over me whenever I speak. I've brought this to the band director's attention and now they won't speak to me. There's lots of tension and I feel unwelcome here, but I can't leave because I have a scholarship and student loans to pay.

One night at practice, I was feeling nauseous and I threw up behind a dumpster. Next day I was taken to urgent care, but couldn't be serviced because they tried charging me $100. My insurance doesn't work in this state so I have to pay for everything out of pocket, which I don't have any money for. I ended up having to go to a local health center, and it turns out I have a UTI. I was prescribed medicine. It took a week to get to me because the local pharmacy was having technical difficulties. I couldn't afford my medicine, the pharmacist offered to cover it for me, and I missed two weeks of practice. 

My roommate hasn't been making this any better either. Every morning I wake up to her alarm, and she sleeps through it. One morning it rang for a full hour, while music was loudly playing, and she slept through it all while I was up, unable to sleep. I tried waking her up but she doesn't budge. She leaves the room messy and she blasts music while I'm trying to sleep. I tried talking to her about this, but she doesn't want to listen to anything I have to say. I reached out to the residency department and they said it's too late for me to switch rooms.


Just today, my suite mates (it's eight people per suite, four dorms per suite, two people per dorm) had made a mess in the suite. They left, and I came back to find the suite messy, with trash everywhere. They had eaten and left all of their drinks and plates there, and a whole cart of trash in the suite. I was sitting in my room, complaining about it to my friends back home, when my roommate (who wasn't there at the time), called and asked me to clean it up for them, by myself. Apparently they had all went on a shopping trip over half an hour away, and it was expected to be cleaned up by the next 20 minutes, or we'd all get fined $150. I called my RA, and apparently she was already aware of the situation, because she asked me who did it, and I said I didn't know. The other suite mates had all said the same thing, so I felt taken aback by this. Eventually they came back and cleaned it, and I had to go for a walk to clear my head because of the anger I felt. I came back from my walk, and they all started to verbally attack me because they felt betrayed by the fact that I didn't clean up after them. 

I'm currently on a tuition payment plan of $500 a month, and my next payment comes up in two days. I am completely broke, and my mother is no help. I've asked for more scholarship money, and there's nothing else that they can give. They advised me to take another loan out, but this loan has to be taken out by my mother, and she is no help.

5,alenamalina,1660517737,/r/college/comments/woj8c6/adding_a_major_senior_year/,"So I'm in a bit of a weird situation. Last year, my major changed its requirements about two weeks after the drop add period and I basically finished my major first semester of junior year, and finished my degree requirements last semester. But I really didn't want to graduate early at all. First off, I had really bad mental and physical health issues, and I had actually been trying to take the past two years off for that specifically but my parents did not let me. Why I listened to them I'm not sure, since I pay for college and rent myself with financial aid and multiple minimum wage jobs. This was incredibly difficult, at one point I ran out of money and couldn't afford food, and I started having daily panic attacks and a couple of strokes because of it. But also, part of me was mad at my shitty three years of college and I wanted to have a normal year. I knew this year's tuition would be covered by financial aid and scholarships so financially it wouldn't even be that bad of a decision.

Regardless, I'm going into my fourth year majoring in International Relations. When I was making decision I also thought, hey this will be cheaper and better than paying rent at home and job hunting for a field that I know I cant get a job in yet because I don't have enough experience or connections. I can work and save up for my last year and continue to network, especially since the IR field really needs connections and college was online for year and a half.

But the problem is, I... kind of hate my major. I've hated probably since about second semester sophomore year and I've been too stuck mentally to change it. I know, it's completely my fault and I have to deal with the consequences of my actions, but it still sucks. I originally wanted to get a masters in IR and work for a think tank or for the state department, or maybe work for a nonprofit. At first I actually liked the major until I started learning about the corruption in the field. Honestly idk what I expected. I went to college to learn, not to necessarily train for a job. 

Now.. I just want financial stability. After being abused and harassed at my minimum wage jobs for so long I can't stand being financially unstable and I don't want a job that pays $40k after obtaining a graduate degree. When I first went into this my parents actually promised to pay for half my tuition and rent, but because of family issues I had to start supporting myself starting sophomore year. That shit is incredibly fucking difficult on around $11-12 an hour, especially when jobs refuse to give you enough hours. I am tired of working hard for terrible pay. Basically, after going from a family that was relatively well off to struggling to survive, my priorities have shifted. I no longer want to help people for work and I'd rather do some job I tolerate and do what I enjoy outside of work, including activism and learning about politics.

I've found that the only thing I really enjoy in this major is data analysis and research. I think working with R is fun and I never understood why people were struggling with it. This past summer I did some RA work for my professor and I'm doing my own research project this semester, and I'm also working as an RA for another professor.

So I've thought about a relatively different career path as a data scientist. I like working with numbers and I feel like this will make me a livable wage. I've thought about adding an information science degree, since it'll give me the skills I need to get into this field. But I've also thought about going into grad school. Here's where I'm unsure. Should I basically get a second bachelors in information science and go into data science, or should I just whatever classes I can in programming (like for R, SQL, and python), learn the rest on my own, and apply to grad school for data science? Or, can I learn these on my own and get a job in data science with just my bachelors in IR?

In terms of cost, I have this year's tuition and living accommodations covered, but I'm not sure that I'll get aid for my fifth year. I know I can potentially get a local scholarship and maybe a few grants, an interest free loan from a local scholarship, and I know that since this isn't technically my second bachelors I can also get loans from FAFSA. I've also thought about bootcamp, but to be honest its more expensive than what I would pay for one year at my state  university.

Is it worth the time and investment? Or am I just fucking stupid",college,Adding a major senior year,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/woj8c6/adding_a_major_senior_year/,1660535737.0
6,aapetired,1660337040,/r/college/comments/wmvgp0/did_you_work_full_time_through_full_time_school/,"I'm going into the last year of my undergrad degree, I've been working full time all through college,  taking 16+ credits a term (even though 12cr is considered full time at my university). This coming school year I also have a 15hr a week internship. I'm planning on taking a gap year before going back for a masters degree (the program I'm in offers an accelerated master's program for people that completed their undergrad at this university, so I can finish my master's in one year). (I'm in the U.S. by the way)

I'm really worried about being able to manage finishing a graduate degree while working full time. This undergrad degree feels like it's killing me, but I really can't do anything with this degree, I need a master's to even use it. I don't have the option to not work full time. I need the benefits (health insurance) and the income to afford my bills, I support myself and am estranged/no contact with my family, so I don't have literally anyone else that can help me out financially. I also make just barely too much money to get a pell grant or anything like that, and my student loans don't fully cover my tuition - I have to pay 500-1000 out of pocket every term. I can't afford to cut back my hours at work. 

I know it's just a couple more years, but last term I ended up in the hospital due to overworking myself (40 hrs a week at work, 20 credits in school to avoid having to take summer classes). I'm worried about balancing an internship, full time job, and full time school this coming year. I contacted my field work advisor and academic advisor and they were of no help at all. Everyone just says ""self care"", which I try my best to do.

I got accepted into a university recently and they said I was granted a 50 percent scholarship on tuition of my first year there. The problem is, they demanded: ""Every student, including those who received a scholarship, must pay full tuition at the beginning of each semester. Then, the accounting department will give students our scholarship money.""

I considered enrolling in this school partly because of the scholarship. But with their policy, I'm afraid I cannot afford it because I can't send all that money at once. If you decided to give a student a scholarship, why not just deduct it from their tuition? why make them pay all that money and then return?

However, every year tuition costs are rising and rising, and inflation is squeezing the average American. With this, wages aren't keeping up and being outpaced by inflation by a large margin. To me, this sounds like the ratio of earnings to college tuition price for the average American household gap is getting even bigger. Correct me if I'm wrong, but that either means less people will be able to go to college because they can't afford it, or will succumb to student loan debt with an even higher balance that will take even longer to pay off than ever before. Not to mention the rising interest rates and some recent FAFSA rule changes that is making some policies more strict, so less families will get aid.

Any suggestions or even your own lists are welcome.

- First and foremost, I need to get out of my room, dude! I don't have to be a hermit anymore to evade my family. My dorm building is full of opportunities to socialize, especially since it only houses freshmen, and I really gotta take advantage if I'm paying all that money for it. The way the building is structured is that it's a tower with a sort of hangout area in each floor; maybe I could bring my Switch, hook it up to one of the TVs, and invite others to play with me. Or study in that area... anything to not fester in my dorm room.

- Get used to being more open. I'll have a random roommate (luckily, they have a roommate matching system to pair those with common interests/habits) so most privacy is off the table anyway, but I just gotta be more interesting. I do a lot of cool things - art, animation, creative writing, all of that on top of majoring in CS - and I'm not usually expressive about these. Since I have nothing to hide anymore (overbearing family), why not show people the cool stuff I make? This also goes for things like my favorite music artists, animes, etc., many of which I wear on my clothes. I get judged every day at home for these, but once I move out, who's going to really give a damn about what I wear? I could connect with someone through these anyway.

- Be presentable. Nothing crazy, just keep my consistent hygiene habits going, brush my teeth more often, and (this is a little embarrassing to admit but) keep my hands off my face and get my nails growing healthy again after so many months of stress. I've promised myself to start these right after my high school graduation two weeks from now. Quitting is honestly harder for me than it might seem.

- Hit the gym if I can. They have a recreational building with a full gymnasium near my dorm, and if my schedule can fit it in, maybe get a good workout in occasionally. I need to gain muscle weight and not look like a walking skeleton.

- Stop procrastinating. I can't breeze through my schoolwork at the last minute anymore, especially not with a STEM major.

- Know my campus and get involved, take advantage of extra educational opportunities, and find a good work-study program. They all pay the same towards my tuition so it's just a matter of picking what sounds cool.

- Be careful with my spending habits. I can't really afford to throw money out the window as I do already.

With that said, I go to a run of the mill cardinal direction state school in one of the smaller towns in the less populated side of my state. Realistically no one outside of this state knows about this school, and I doubt anyone more than an hour or two away from here could tell you anything about the school beyond its name.

Even within our state, we are known for nothing. We have no programs or courses of study worth noting, our sports teams are nothing special, our band, choir, preforming arts, and anything else you could think of are just your run of the mill programs, and we aren't known for being a good research institution.

We are just here to provide a decent and cheap education for mostly local commuter students. Most students who come from out of state are from rural areas in neighboring states or have family ties to this area.

However, if you were to walk across the courtyard during passing periods on any given day. You'd never be more than a stone's throw away from a group of Chinese/Japanese/Korean/Arab/Indian/whatever students. There's literally more of them here than kids from out of state?

Some context: I go to a trade school/college and for the 3 out of my 4 semesters, it was going fine. Suddenly into our 4th semester, the professor of our class emailed us telling us he had some health emergency and we are on our own. He also said that he was going to set the midterm online with further details ""coming soon"". Fast forward a couple months to around the end of March and our prof emails us asking us to submit 3 labs within 4 days otherwise we're getting a zero on it. We didn't do these labs and this really pissed me off. I went ahead and emailed the Deen plus the chair and nothing happened. They didn't even acknowledge my email or send anything back. I eventually submitted the labs and went on with my school. The prof then emails us that after he's done marking the labs he's gonna set up the exam. Now the whole class is pissed. How are we suppose to do an exam when we have no idea whats going on in the class. Some people went to talk to the deen in person and they told me that they just took them as a joke and brushed them off. We all slowly forget about it and then when all our classes are almost finished, we get an email saying next week is our exam. Now I start studying my ass off cuz I cannot afford to lose my GPA. I have been grinding my ass off so I can get into uni and I'm not boutta mess up now. The day right before the exam, there is some heavy snowfall and our prof emails us again asking if it's safe for us to come in to write the exam the next and if it's not safe then the exam will be canceled and it will be put online. We'll he replies saying that the exam is canceled and we'll be updated with further details. Today we get an email saying that our exam is Friday. I am pissed. I can't believe that this is considered one of the best trade schools in the country. 

I just want to know if there's some way at all, I can do anything. Can i get my tuition back? Can i get out of this exam? Is there someone I can contact, talk to, or even let know so that people don't make the same mistake and come to this school just so they waste their money and play ring around with their prof.

19,Wildjay7931,1649567301,/r/college/comments/u0an03/taking_a_year_break_from_school_your_opinion/,"I'm a student at a university. On my second year. Going for two degrees. One a degree in creative writing, the other a degree in biology. All with a minor in Outdoor Adventure.

This is the final term of my second year at my university, but basically my first (because of Covid and other factors). Also, I'm 26. It took me 6 years at my community college to finally figure out what I wanted to do and get accepted to a university. And, despite my previous 6 years at a Community College, intellectual, I'm not much better than when I graduated highschool.

So, six years at a Community College, two years at my university, and still basically a freshman...

Now, I have always loved school. And still do, but I feel way overloaded at the moment. Not just with school, but personal life aspects too.
I have ADHD, which has always affected me in school (in some good ways actually, depending on the topic), I also have brain damage from when I was 16 which basically wiped my memory clean and I have had to relearn almost everything. And that by itself has been trouble. But, even worse, really the worst aspect of all I think, is a social anxiety disorder I gained as a consequence of my memory loss.
Basically, I was embarrassed of not knowing elementary things in highschool that I learned to lie and pretend I knew. Which made it so much harder for me to relearn since everyone thought I already knew. And my fear of others judging my hidden lack of knowledge made me more and more anxious to a point where I am now with a social anxiety disorder. And with my lack of relearned knowledge it makes many of my classes more difficult. Now, I'm actually a quick learner, but with the anxiety around judgment and how far behind I am intellectually, all coupled with my ADHD, I feel I am learning almost nothing in my courses. Putting me farther and farther behind.

Along with all this my family is currently going through some tough times too. And my distance from them and inability to help is heavy too.

And I'm confident, if I was to take a year off school, I would be able to catch up with the information I have missed.

I have the material and text from all my courses along with recordings many of my professors actually post to YouTube of their lectures and classes. And without the angst of time and judgment of others I could easily study over this year break and be closer to, if not at the level of the other students. And with the fear of judgment of my intellect being my greatest influence for my anxiety, I would be much more comfortable in class with the knowledge I missed.
Hell, I may even be confident!

I would also have time to get more help with my mental and some of my physical health which had fallen behind too, thanks to my anxious waist of time.

But...

Their are of course consequences if I do take a break

For one, if I take a year break, then that means it will take me an entire nother year to gain my degrees.

Also, at the moment I am noteably dependent on my financial aid. It covers a majority of my living expenses.
I do work, but at the moment I'm only doing Doordash to help a little during the school year and cover me over my summer breaks. I've had a few other regular jobs, but my anxiety has caused me for one reason or another to quick or lose them.
Doordash is the only one so far that I feel comfortable doing. Hell, I actually enjoy in a little. And with my low living expenses, I could likely get by with Doordash for a year (I did the math, haha), but I'm still nervous of it though.

Also, at my university, I actually found a program that helps students like me with similar disabilities. I have a coach I meet with each week who greatly helps me out. Honestly the only person I have met yet in my two years at my university that I am comfortable, even enjoy, interacting with. Closest thing to a friend I've had in years. And taking a years break, I wouldn't have that. Plus the help the program gives me not only with school, but life outside of school too.

And finally, one more thing that makes me terrified of taking a year break... Making a friend...

It sounds odd for a 26 year old man to say this, but making a friend is honestly my biggest goal at the moment. While I have social anxiety disorder, it has lessened on the past year or so, and I have made it a goal of mine to make a friend. Because, well, I'm lonely as fuck. I mean, my family lives in another state as do all my old friends from way back when. I have made it a goal of mine to make a friend.

And school is the best place for that. For me, there's not many other options outside of school at the moment really for me to make friends. I'm hold no religious affiliation, I don't drink or smoke (hate the idea of lacking sobriety), I'm more so an introvert, I hate parties. I don't follow sports. School is really my best option to meet people I can connect with at the moment. And damn, I'm depressedly lonely. I wantva friend.

Now, I know the option of just taking one or two classes, and I would go with that option but I'm in an odd situation with my university.
I'm an out of state student, but I'm in a program where I get in state tuition as long as I am a full time student. And the out of state tuition is so noteably higher that just two credits with out of state tuition would cost me nearly the same as me getting in state tuition as a full time student.
And I am not rich. My family can't help me out (they would if they could but my families broke). And with my low income I am unable to pull a student loan without a cosigner. And I have no family with goodenough credit and/or income to cosign with me.
So, with school tuition, I rely on being a full time student or else, ironically, I couldn't afford it.

Oh, also, I'm fearful that if I take a break, like so many others unfortunately, I may not return. Which is an awful thought seeing as all my life goals rely on me going to school, and school honestly being one of my favorite places.

Anyway...

Given my awkward, long worded situation what is your opinion?

My head's going 50/50 right now. Any opinion on either option, or others, is welcome.

(I just feel like ranting a bit: I don't have a penny saved to my name for college.

But I'm in my 2nd semester of college - the classes aren't even hard yet, but I'm feeling overwhelmed, getting bad grades, I have no motivation to do stuff other than homework, and I've felt pretty depressed ever since I started. I don't know why I chose my major, I don't know what would happen if I changed or what I would change to.

I'm a math/civil engineering major. But you know what? My worst grades are in my math classes. I was 2 years ahead in math in high school, and now I feel like bottom of the barrel in math. I'm in calc 1 and I can barely even differentiate an equation. I definitely could understand the material, but the thing is every time I sit down and try to study I lose focus, my brain gets foggy, and I just find it exhausting.

I don't have a social life and the only times I'm with people are when we have a group assignment to finish. I go to my classes and then go home or sometimes I find a secluded area of the library to stay in. And yeah I commute, which only makes making friends harder. I'm not bad with people, but I have mild social anxiety, and I've always been introverted and quiet. Since college started, I've fallen into a state where I feel much more comfortable being alone and that honestly surpasses the loneliness I sometimes feel. I also just don't feel like I identify with anyone at my school. And the idea of going to clubs just scares me. Outside I have anonymity in a weird way because most people don't bother with other random people. In a club setting it's more personal.

Recently I've also fallen into a habit of skipping classes. I know it's terrible so don't remind me. Sometimes I just can't even muster the energy to walk in there. Several of my classes are just boring lectures where I find myself half asleep and unable to focus at all. Then I feel like it's a waste of time to go in the first place. I don't know what it is but sometimes I just can't do it. Maybe I'm just weak-willed?

On top of all that, my school is stupid expensive. My family can barely afford the tuition after applying for several loans. I do have merit scholarships. Of course, to keep them I need to stay above a certain GPA threshold, and if I'm unable to do that then I'll probably have to drop out. Which means I'll be tens of thousands of dollars in debt with nothing to show for it. 

It's a serious problem. Why don't I have the motivation to take action? Why do I feel apathetic to all this? I'm here to create a path to my future because I don't want to work at McDonald's for the rest of my life. I don't know if this is even the right place to post all this.

Oakland University is a medium sized school with around 12,000 students and good engineering programs. It has stuck out to me throughout my college application process because of the many merit and financial need based scholarships I'm eligible for there. My family is well off enough but my parents can't afford to pay for any of my college so I'll be taking out student loans or paying out of pocket for everything. Money has been a big factor throughout the process. 
        I applied to U of M just to see if I got in, I wasn't really planning on attending due to the money issue. However, this changed a few days ago. I received an email that I'd been accepted to U of M which was awesome, and I also received the HAIL scholarship which is full tuition for 4 years. Now it's not so clear to me if I should go to Oakland or U of M. 
       At Oakland I've received scholarships covering full tuition and half of housing. As it stands Oakland will cost $6,000 a year not counting local scholarships per additional Oakland application based scholarships. 
         U of M currently will cost around $12,000 a year currently, however I haven't received my financial aid offering from them yet. 
         I've always been a small town guy and honestly the size and scope of U of M is intimidating to me. The accounts of snobby and arrogant students don't thrill me either. I've visited Oakland and done lots of research on it and to a certain extent I've fallen in love with it. The location is a plus for me as not too far north there are beautiful woodlands and natural areas I'd like to camp in and explore. Oakland has a great advising and job placement program which I've heard can be hard to find at Michigan due to the large student body. However, I recognize that U of M will probably provide a better education and more opportunities anyways, but right now I can't decide if that will be worth the extra money. 
        I'm fairly outgoing but I wouldn't describe myself as competitive (easygoing would be a better term) which from what I've read is a big deal if you're trying to thrive at U of M. I want to be social in college but I don't ever plan on drinking or partying so that's not an issue for me. There are various other cons that come with attending U of M vs Oakland, most of them related to the size of the school (transportation - especially for engineers living on the north campus - and parking seem to be a big headache which is a problem for me as I plan on driving to Lansing quite frequently).
        The main problem here is I've obviously never been to college, and I don't know what a college experience is like, so how could I possibly compare them. In the end the decision will still fall on me, but if anyone has any words of advice I would greatly appreciate them.

My father was able to cosign with me last year. But, this year, my dad has had some medical issues, lost his job and can't cosign with me. And I have no other family that could either.
I have no clue what to do. Am I just screwed, or is there an option I don't know about?

I have also looked at other options to help with money for school and living, such as scholarships but have yet to find any I'm eligible for. I'm a doing fine with school, but I'm not a straight A student and don't have anything really special about me that makes me stand out for or be eligible for special funding.

Also, one of the reasons I'm short on money for school, even with FAFSA, is medical conditions I have. I often have to travel a distance for my doctor appointments and medications which add up notably.

Sorry for the long description. In all, I'm short on school and living expenses even with FAFSA, and don't have anyone that can cosign with me for a private student loan.

I'm currently enrolled at Columbus State Community College. I hope to transfer to Ohio State University if/once I earn an Associate degree in pursuit of a Chemical Engineering Bachelor's degree/career. But I am not enrolled in any classes yet because I don't see how I can afford it. And again, I'm at a community college. Tuition is not the issue here. It's living expenses. I need to come up with about $1500 a month, pure cash. I wish it could be less, but I have a mother/family to support. But here's the thing, I thought that was a lot, but according to The College Board, that's ""moderate spending"" in the 2016-2017 academic year.

https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/2016-07-05/estimate-living-expenses-to-determine-college-affordability

A job could cover that, and I have one. Hence how I'm able to support my family right now. But the time a job takes prevents me from going to school. Even if I could somehow schedule my shifts so that I had time to go to class, my academic advisor explains that 1 credit hour of class comes out to 3 hours per week outside of class, studying and doing homework and the like. 

https://www.aic.edu/academics/credit-hours-calculator/

At LEAST. This is an especially hard rule for engineering students, which I am/hope to be. So going from class to work with only an hour between wouldn't leave me enough time to get my coursework done.

But there are full time engineering students. Lots of them. And they don't all come from rich families. So how are they affording their living expenses if they aren't working full time? My academic advisor didn't know. So she referred me to a financial aid advisor. She told me the financial aid advisor could advise me on the proper pursuit of full-time studenthood. 

We must not understand what a ""financial aid advisor"" does. Because this financial aid advisor was fucking useless as far as that. What she did know was how to say ""Have you accepted your reward package yet?"" I explained to her that the reward package alone isn't enough to cover school + living expenses, and I needed to know, based on her wisdom and what she's seen of other students and how this tends to work out, what the wise steps to take are if I'm looking to cover what The College Board alleges are moderately typical expenses. If these expenses are so typical, I'm assuming she as an advisor has seen many students in this situation, who need to cough up this kind of money, and did somehow cough up that kind of money. But no, she knew dick outside of what everyone already knows about the financial aid process. I know what a federal loan is, I know what its limits are. Obviously gambling on scholarships is of no use to me if I need money right now. Not in March of 2022. So she says ""Well, you could take out private loans..."" And I'm like ""Is that wise?"" And she's like ""No, no loan is wise."" So can this just not be done??? She, whose job I assumed was advising about a tenable path to paying for college, is giving me advice and then immediately following it up with ""That's bad advice by the way. I don't know what to tell you.""

The closest thing to valuable advice I could find was on Reddit. r/CSCC is a ghost town. r/OSU has mostly suggested things that only apply if I'm an actual student at Ohio State. Some have suggested part time work, but are there really jobs out there that are so part time that I can go to school full time AND do all my homework AND all of my labs/group projects AND study AND go to work? The College Board says people are doing it. But I can't find a job like that. People say ""Get a part time job as a waiter. The hours are short &amp; flexible, and the tips are plenty."" But you can't just get a job as a waiter. I've tried. It takes training before they make you a waiter and I need wait staff money now. I can't support my family without it. And that's if they even give you a chance. In Columbus especially they talk a big game about how desperate they are for wait staff &amp; other restaurant staff. But the only place that didn't turn me away because they're ""not looking to train someone new"" offered me a door job that averages only $40 in tips a night. If I worked every night I would be barely scraping half of what I need. I appreciate them being honest with me though.

I need to talk to someone who's done this. So I can follow their example. Crunch the numbers as might, it just don't add up. Everyone warns me, Chemical Engineering, or any engineering at all, is a dreadful undertaking. My academic advisor expressly warned me against pursuing an engineering degree while working full time. So where are engineering students getting money for food and rent if they're busy with schoolwork all the time??? What part time jobs are covering their living expenses? Can I have one of those jobs???

38,thebulletinaction,1630103101,/r/college/comments/pcxktr/transferred_to_a_different_college_and_dont_know/,"Hi all,

To give some quick backstory, I graduated in 2019 and was accepted and attended the University of Michigan. What nobody had told me, however, was that pretty much 40% of my scholarship was based on need-based aid, something that fluctuated based on my EFC and my FAFSA. So off I went into freshman year, having the time of my life and getting everything out of college that I desired. Michigan was a perfect school for me in every stretch of the word. Big campus, great studies, amazing social life, loved Ann Arbor, had great friends, you know the jist.

Well, then covid hit, and as I was rounding the corner into my sophomore year, I had lost my need-based scholarship that had sent my out of pocket costs from $6,000 a year to $27,000 a year. However, due to the pandemic, they processed my aid very late, and as a result, I had figured out I could not afford my second year mere DAYS before I started my second year, so I was thrown into a gap year.

If you're a middle class student, I'm sure you're aware with how unfairly you are treated within the American Education System. Too rich for financial aid, too poor for out of pocket. Transferring out of state was impossible, so to say, and even if I did get into another great school, that EFC was going to fuck me over at one point, so it wasn't even worth it if I had to find out I had to transfer again.

So, locked within my home state of Kentucky, I looked for potential transfer schools. I was a CS student at the time, but through Michigan I was achieving the major WITHOUT going through the school of engineering. However, looking at my big state schools, they only had offered CS through engineering. That was a big nope for me. I switched majors to my other passion, Music Technology.

I then applied to a very small private, Catholic college in my city that offered the program, and I was accepted with pretty good financial aid. This financial aid is merit-based, and so it is permanent. I'm working at FedEx, and I will be able to use the tuition reimbursement to pay off my federal loans from the jump. I will also be living off campus with my best friends. And I will be chasing my dreams of becoming a performer. It's definitely not all bad, but now I'm going to talk about the bad.

I feel like an outcast on this campus. I'm not religious at all, and a lot of the people here I don't relate to at all. It has an undergrad population of about 2,500, and the campus is tiny. It doesn't feel like much is going on here. I tried to be proactive and look for clubs and activities to join. I'm not joking when I say there isn't anything except for environmental stuff and some club sports. I also hate commuting, and I feel like I miss out on many events because many of the stuff is word of mouth. And the social events just feel... forced, too. Overall, it is NOTHING like my old school, and the big state experience fits my personality better than this school ever will.

I guess if I had to summarize it, from a logistics standpoint it checks all my boxes, and I made best with the shitty hand I was dealt. But from an emotional and social standpoint, it makes me feel upset and trapped. Does anyone have any advice? I was maybe thinking about transferring again, but honestly I feel like I should just bite the bullet and make-do.

But it's so hard to not compare this new life with the one my old friends are still living, and the one that I physically can't live any longer. I don't want to have a bad college experience. Maybe it just takes some adjusting?",college,Transferred to a different college and don't know how to feel.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/pcxktr/transferred_to_a_different_college_and_dont_know/,1630121101.0

I am VERY low income but I am fighting to complete my master's degree and improve my quality of life.

Through undergrad I never really did the summer thing, but I ALWAYS knew the requirements for summer course loads are different than regular semester loads. For example, my friend's uni has a 4 credit minimum for full time enrollment for summer. Apparently, my school is the same for all semester. so 12 credit minimum to be considered full time, even in the summer (yikes..)   


Apparently as well, to get aid from FAFSA, you need a minimum of 5 credits. I did not know this. I tried digging around to find this information on my school's website, and it's legit just not there and the information is very difficult to find. I had to search on the .gov website to find the info.   


long story short, I enrolled for a summer course. Financial aid never said anything to me. I enrolled, applied for aid, was granted aid. half way through summer course I'm like where the flip is my aid? I reach out to them to ask what the hold up is (delays have been common especially since covid) and then they inform me because my class is only worth 4 credits, I do not qualify for aid and it is too late to drop the course and now I can pay the full 5k and keep the course going, or drop it and pay a % of the tuition cost. (roughly 3,000) W.T.F!? Had I know about the 5 credit minimum I would not have enrolled into summer courses, ESPECIALLY because for my degree only one 4 credit course was even available. I am trying to petition but they're saying I have to be mentally ill or sick, or have a death in the family and prove to them this to get the refund for extenuating circumstances. I did that, showing meds I have, a divorce I went through (even those it's not even the reason but whatever I cant afford the fee they're trying to give me) but I don't think anything I submitted qualified as the timing of my divorce and my meds/depression was a month or two prior to the start of summer semester.   


Does anyone feel this is off at all? Shouldn't financial aid have reached out to me sooner to warn me BEFORE the deadline that I don't qualify for student aid?

Throughout these two semesters, I did bad in school as I wasn't paying attention in online classes and barely getting by. This affected my grades and resulted academic disqualification. 

I understood where I made mistakes and the consequences but now it's too late - I can't do much about my past now. Two years of education from community college is now wasted by one year of carelessness.

I am already experiencing the beginning of these regrets and I want to put and end to it.

45,oozak9,1623726828,/r/college/comments/o04bve/dropped_out_2_years_ago_but_want_to_go_back_to/,"Hello everyone,

I studied in the UCLA film program for 2yrs but dropped out for financial and personal issues. I spent another two years working as a 3D printing teacher in a HS in Korea and I have now realized that I want to pursue a degree in EE or CS. I am currently self-studying programming and math, and I'm enjoying it a lot.

A big issue is that I failed a class right before dropping out, so my GPA dropped from 3.7 to 3.37. Another issue is out-of-state tuition cost. If I go back to UCLA, I plan to move to Cali and work for a year to get in state tuition, but there goes another year of my life. If I transfer, I'm going to have to go to a cheap school or apply for a transfer scholarship, but I don't know if that's possible with that GPA. I really can't afford to take out any more loans.

Here's what I think I can do:

1. Change majors - Go back to UCLA and petition to change majors to engineering. But it's almost impossible to change majors into their engineering school, especially with that GPA, and I did not take ANY math classes.
2. Transfer after fixing grades - go back to UCLA, pay out-of-state for one semester, take some math classes, retake the class I failed, and fix my GPA. Then transfer to another engineering school in the US.
3. Just transfer right now to another engineering college and explain my personal story. Again, I didn't take any math classes and my GPA is poor.
4. Start fresh - apply to another college as a freshman. I am totally okay with doing this, and it also seems like there will be more scholarship opportunity. If I have to retake the SAT, I am good with that as well. Obviously I'll have to omit the fact I went to UCLA.
5. Start fresh at an engineering school in Seoul, Korea. I am here now, and I've heard it's easy for foreigners to get into top schools. This might be best, because college is basically free if you do well.
6. Go to cheap community college, fix some grades, and transfer out.

I honestly don't know what to do in this situation and whether there are more options that I'm missing. I would love for some input and also any advice in general with this situation. Which plan might work best?

TLDR - Went to UCLA for 2yrs as a film major, dropped out for another 2rs, want to go back to school as an engineering major, but have a suboptimal GPA. And I'm very poor :(",college,Dropped out 2 years ago but want to go back to school with a different major - Should I transfer schools or simply start over?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/o04bve/dropped_out_2_years_ago_but_want_to_go_back_to/,1623744828.0

47,Neon_Salesman,1623271596,/r/college/comments/nw5wv4/academic_probation_appeal_advice/,"Hello, I am in the process of drafting an appeal for academic probation. To make a long story short I made a bad choice and provided a peer with test info in a course that I then failed. Accordingly, I only got 10 of the 12 necessary credit hours to be in good academic standing. At my university academic probation isn't punitive, but it's supposed to be ""supportive."" However, I will lose my scholarships for the semester, can't participate in varsity sports while on probation, and cannot hold an elected position in any clubs. 

The school suggests the following for appeals:

&gt;Outline the issue that led to you earning too few credits this semester, what you learned from that experience and how you plan to move forward, point out your academic performance in your remaining classes from the Spring semester, and propose why you shouldn't be placed on probation

Members of r/college, if you would be so kind, please share your thoughts on my appeal draft. Do I convey my thoughts succinctly and appropriately? Do you believe I am making a fair argument. Thank you in advance.

Note I have edited some things for privacy. I am a rising senior.

&gt;I wish to appeal the motion for academic probation on the basis of my 2021 Spring Semester. In the Spring of 2021, I was enrolled in Course. I made a regrettable decision during the course of the class to provide a peer with test information. This resulted in an Academic Integrity violation and my failure of the course. Thus, I earned only ten of the required twelve credit hours for the semester. I have met with Dr. Professor, the professor of course, and Dean Dean regarding this incident, and completed all requisite ethics training.   
&gt;  
&gt;In reflection, I know and believe my actions were unacceptable. I undermined the learning potential of myself and my peer, as well as the atmosphere of academic excellence at this university. However, this isolated incident of poor judgement and forethought has reinforced the values I hold by showing me what happens when I neglect to adhere to them. It has also shown me the value in being candid and honest about my decisions. I hope that this isolated incident does not become a hallmark of my undergraduate experience or a roadblock to my future. Rather, it will serve as a personal reminder and a learning experience for the consequences of shortcuts and ill-guided decisions. I can say with utmost certainty that an incident of this nature will not, ever, happen again. I have learned much, and continue to learn and grow from this occurrence.  
&gt;  
&gt;I respectfully ask that the Academic Standing Board does not make a motion to place me on academic probation. The event that has caused my deficient credit acquisition has been resolved completely. It will not affect my academic performance in the future. This was an isolated case of one poor choice, and does not reflect a trend of poor academic performance. Through my written and oral ethics tutorial with Dean Dean, I have already engaged in and completed an extensive process that has allowed for meaningful reflection. It has also proactively prepared me to finish my final two semesters with diligence and esteem.   
&gt;  
&gt;I believe that my other courses in the Spring of 2021, of which I received A’s in all, and my transcript as a whole, demonstrate that I am a capable student; that the framework of academic probation is not necessary to continue on towards my degree.  I fully understand that academic probation is not punitive in nature, but is a supportive measure that enacts rigorous guidelines to focus efforts in the classroom for success. Accordingly, I do not feel that I am a candidate for this measure. These missing credit hours have not altered my intended schedule, timeline, or outcome of my studies. Even with a sole failed class, I maintain a GPA of 3.78 and I am well on-track to finish my undergraduate plan, a dual major of Chemical Biology and Psychology, on time. I am confident that all courses I will take for the remainder of my time at University will be A’s or B’s, as has been the pattern throughout my undergraduate career thus far.  I know that I can continue to be successful as an independent undergraduate, without the structures of academic probation.  
&gt;  
&gt;I would like to emphasize that I have maintained my current academic record whilst being a member of the VARSITY SPORT, and holding elected positions in both STUDENT ORG and STUDENT ORG. I take great pride in representing University as a student-athlete, and I would be honored to continue to do so as a rising senior in the fall semester. I believe that this host of extracurricular activities, in tandem with my academic record, demonstrates my ability to balance significant time commitments outside the classroom and excel in the academic setting. I have no doubt in my ability to continue my studies responsibly in future semesters. These activities, VARSITY SPORT in particular, help me to keep a well-planned and efficient schedule. In the fall semester of 2021, I will enroll in 15 credit hours of courses. In the spring of 2022, I will finish my undergraduate requirements and graduate. I also plan to retake COURSE, although not a degree requirement, to demonstrate my capability and honesty as a member of University.  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, the financial implications of academic probation would place a significant burden on my family. As the recipient of a sizable scholarship from the university, it’s revocation would raise my tuition by over $X for the fall semester. As my younger sibling prepares to begin college this coming fall, my family simply cannot afford tuition for the both of us if mine increases so drastically. Therefore, I ask that if the board should decide to move forward with academic probation, they maintain the scholarships I am currently receiving.   
&gt;  
&gt;It is my hope that you will consider this 2 credit hour deficient semester as nothing more than an outlying data point in my undergraduate career, and conclude that I am not a student in need of the support structures imposed by academic probation. I would like to reiterate my most genuine regret for my academic integrity violation and the lessons I’ve learned from it, as well my steadfast dedication to excellence in my education. I sincerely thank you for your time and consideration, and I know you will weigh this decision with the utmost care and concern.",college,Academic Probation Appeal Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/nw5wv4/academic_probation_appeal_advice/,1623289596.0

I know it is early to worry about this but the earlier I get this sorted out the better. My parents are incredibly (like, insanely) religious and won't allow me to attend a secular college or else they will not pay. I've been at an extremely religious all girls private school my whole life and I'd honestly rather work at McDonalds for the rest of my life than go to a another teeny religious all girls school for college. There's less than five people in my entire grade and none are going to college, or theyre going to seminary and then a religious college. 

My absolute dream is to study abroad specifically in the UK either England or Scotland. I am in California. Tbh, I know it's crazy for my situation and maybe unrealistic but I just want it so badly. From what I'm looking at, tuition costs are ranging from about 21k-27k per year there. There are a few scholarships but not many, if I can manage to get one or two I can hopefully save a couple thousand dollars. 

My parents make a good amount and could easily pay 4 years of any college without aid if they wanted to--but they don't and won't. So I don't know how I can apply for need-based scholarships or aid because they will be able to see my parents make a lot even though they're not even going to give any to me.

According to the university websites, expenses are due in full before you begin the term. 

I plan on working in college, definitely. However how would I pay the expenses in full before?? I think taking a loan is the most reasonable option here but I'm not sure at all how that works. I don't have any credit history. And is it not worth it to get a loan? This is just my dream and either way I will DEFINITELY not be staying at home when highschool is over.

When I was a teenager, my mom married a man who made a lot of money. It was great for her, but it kind of tripped me. I didn't have college savings as we were in and out of poverty for all of my life, and he said he wasn't going to pay for my college which is completely understandable. I don't know why he would. When it came time to fill out FAFSA years later, I learned that it lined up perfectly with my mom's taxes being filed jointly. I was not eligible for financial assistance from the government. Due to my mom's credit score and my lack of credit history, I wasn't eligible for private loans either.

I ended up going to a cheap school I could afford to pay out of pocket, but again my financial situation changed and I had to drop out. I worked shit jobs make shit wages for 10 hours a day sometimes every day and I was technically homeless but fortunate to have someone let me stay with them until I could afford rent.

Now it's about 5 years later and I am eligible for full financial assistance, covering 100% of the cost of tuition but not living expenses. God damn is it a blessing. I cried a fucking lot after supplying my FAFSA info and getting enrolled.

It makes me so sad that people who are already in college, and already have the means to finish just want to quit. Don't.

Yes, it's unfair we have to put ourselves into debt. Yes, it's unfair schools don't give a shit about you and your mental and physical health. Yes, it's unfair schools are charging you just as much for unprepared and disorganized online classes as they would for in-person classes during a pandemic and using the money to line pockets and spend it on sports.

Yeah, it fucking sucks, but what would be the point in waiting for it to get fixed first? You're more than likely going to find yourself in a shittier situation if you stop, and I'm just going to say it gets 1000x harder to go to school if you decide to go back later because you have bills you didn't have in college, so you have to work full time and go to school full time. It's nearly impossible to eat and sleep regularly, and there's a high chance you can't do school from your work. I can, and I am so thankful for that, but that's rarely going to be the case.

Stay in school. This is an opportunity that 2/3 of the US doesn't get, but you're already here. Why squander that? It's only 4 years, and it's going to be the fastest 4 years of your life.

P.S. your school more than likely offers mental health services. That was a huge help my first attempt in college, and they gave me therapy and medication during my time there.

The thing is, I don't really have much of a passion for computer science and all that. I like using them, but the inner workings of them just don't interest me much and computer/information systems and programming aren't super exciting either. I went with this major and career path because I knew there would always be job security and plenty of money to make in the field, but often find myself looking at my school's list of majors and wondering what it'd be like to do something else. I've looked into a lot of different things, from Pharmacy to Law (my current interest), and other things just seem more interesting to me and seem like they'd be more fulfilling. My problem though is that I just feel like I'm out of time and I feel stuck with this choice. I'm 25, 26 in a few months. I know that's not very old but it FEELS old when you're still stuck at home with parents working part time and still will be for quite a while, can't afford much of anything nice like a new, let alone my own place to live, and still have just under 2 years left before I can start a career and do something with my life. I also think about things like how I won't have any health insurance when I turn 26 since I'll be removed off my parent's insurance, and whenever I mention to one of my parents about having some new ideas for what to do, they usually remind me of my age and far I still have to go on this degree and how I need to finish so I can do something with my life (my other parent tends to be more supportive). It's not really so much that this one parent isn't supportive or doesn't care or anything, they're just looking at the future and trying to look at it from a logical standpoint so I can make a smart move on whatever I choose to do and that that choice will be in my best interest

I started getting interested in being a lawyer and I've been doing some research here and there on law schools near me and what the curriculum and tuition and all that good stuff will be, but I end up getting discouraged when I think about how I'd still need to finish a bachelor's (I'd probably change to a Criminal Justice bachelor's which would take the same amount of time to finish as my current degree which is just under 2 years) and then it'll still take another 3 years to finish law school so I'd basically be 30 or 31 depending on when I could start it, and I've read that it's tough to work full time through most of law school and nigh impossible to do it during the first year (or even part time work for that matter, judging by the course load of the first year). I start thinking about how I'm already stuck at home as it is and can't afford to move out or anything like that and doing something like this I'd REALLY be stuck at home then, and it wouldn't feel good to be 30 still stuck at home and never having moved out a single time. All those feelings get coupled with what my parent says about looking ahead and finishing and pretty much not sticking myself in that very situation I think about being stuck in and I just get discouraged from pursuing anything else. I basically feel stuck with what I chose and with my age and how long I still have left until I finish this degree, I just feel like I'm out of time to do anything else, and I could always go back in the future but I'd like to get it right the first time and not have to do that, you know?? It's really my fault that I'm in this situation anyway because I didn't take school seriously enough in my earlier adult years and I valued leisure (like video games) over education and really looking ahead. I mean I have an associate's degree so I've already been in school for years but I regret not being more aggressive with school and planning my future years ago or else I might be doing one of these other things I've looked at doing. Slacking off on it and not really putting a lot of thought into it is something I'll always regret but hopefully I end up feeling happy and fulfilled and satisfied by the field I'm going into

Regardless, I'm sure all this research on law school won't be the last time I go looking at what all other opportunities are out there and wishing I could actually consider them and do them before it really is too late because of how I get closer and closer each semester to earning this degree

But like the topic says, how can I overcome these feelings of feeling stuck on this path that I'm unsure that I want to do and being out of time to consider other options?? That includes the option of just sticking with this one and going for it too, if that's the best option then how could I get past these modes I get into of looking at other things and just look forward to the career path I've chosen??",college,How to overcome feeling like you're stuck and out of time to change degrees/career paths??,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/m41cmx/how_to_overcome_feeling_like_youre_stuck_and_out/,1615637562.0

I moved out of state to attend my particular program, but because of the pandemic I can no longer afford my apartment. At this moment I can't even technically afford to pay to break the lease. My FAFSA was actually based on my income when I was working full-time (I was told they don't update this once you reach senior-status) so my federal loans never reflected my actual situation. I opted to learn remotely this semester because of a history of health issues, and am in the process of moving back in with my parents.  


My school has a process where if you are struggling to pay the balance of your tuition, you can fill out an application explaining your situation and they will review it. I sent this to financial aid over three weeks ago. They sent me a reply saying they got it, and then I never heard back. The first monthly payment was due this week, so I contacted the business office to tell them that I was undergoing a review and hadn't heard yet. They told me I still had to pay the balance, I couldn't adjust the due date, and that there would be a late fee if I need more time. Shortly thereafter I checked my financial aid online and it said my balance was paid in full. Then I got an email from the business office saying I was actually going to get a REFUND check.  


This afternoon students got a mass email saying that they accidentally doubled everyone's scholarship amount (why on earth that would ever happen I can't even wager a guess) and that everyone's financial aid info was messed up for a couple days. I called them to ask when I can expect to hear back about the review process, they said they didn't know. I told them that the lack of communication and the clerical goof was something I take very seriously, because I am in a very serious financial situation trying to finish this degree. I told them I don't feel as though the full seriousness of how dire the financial circumstances are for students right now.  


I was told, oh OF COURSE they understand what students are going through. And I was told I did the ""right thing"" by advocating for myself. I'm almost 30 and I felt like I was being spoken to and treated like a kid. Pretty audacious considering you're charging me $30,000 a year.   


An hour and a half later I get an email saying that in response to my financial aid review there's ""no additional funding"" for me. But oh, I can enroll in a monthly payment plan if that helps!  


I know private universities are businesses and the bottom line is all that they really care about. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. But my school began a nearly $100 million apartment/shopping complex last year. And the reimbursement date for tuition has passed, so even if I were to unenroll I would still owe the same amount. I can't help but feel like, they knew I was going to have to cough up this money at some point so why would they help me? My school markets themselves as being an environment of solidarity and a perpetuator of social justice work, which I find sickening when I see how little is being done for students who are still struggling in a pandemic after almost a year.  


Be a private college, keep paying those administrators top dollar, keep watching the money roll in, fine. But don't pretend to care about the financial situation of your students, or about the idea of promoting equity in the world.

Not in a legal dependent sort of way, but my mom is too poor to afford rent and utilities on her own. So she depends on contributions from her ""adult children"" who live with her. If I was to move out, like into a dorm, she would eventually be evicted or something if she went without my contributions. We're all basically like dependents on each other? I'd like to earn a Bachelor's degree though. I'm trying to figure out what my options are as far as money. My household depends on about $1,000 to $1,200 a month in contributions from me. How can I continue to provide that much, but be a full time student? Is it even possible?

My first thought was loans. I don't like them, but most people go to school on loans. But in addition to tuition and supplies, I still need $1,000 to $1,200 a month in cash. Federal student loans only go as high as $12,000 a year, and that's only for seniors. I wouldn't even know where to find a lender who would allow me to take out enough money. Furthermore, from what I understand, borrowing more money than that over 4 years of schooling just isn't done. That's an insane amount of debt that no one takes on. It would never be paid off in my lifetime even if I could take out that much.

So people say ""Go to community college, it'll save you money."" That's the plan for the first two years. But if I want a Bachelor's degree, I'm eventually gonna have to transfer to non-community college.

55,MindfulRain,1611175128,/r/college/comments/l1hysw/cant_afford_grad_school_and_im_exempt_from_most/,"I graduated last year with my B.A. in History with a 3.9 out of 4.0 GPA from California State University.  
  
I am in the process of applying to multiple universities for my MA. I have no doubt that I will get accepted into most, if not all, of them. The issue is that I live in Europe now (permanently with my Italian spouse) and am looking at school here since we have no plans on returning to the states. While tuition is cheaper here than in the US, I still cannot afford grad school. I have enough in savings to last me two years of living expenses OR two years of schooling, but not both at the same time. 

I've reached out to nearly a dozen schools and they have all told me that I will not be eligible for their scholarships for Americans because my residency is in Europe, despite being an American citizen. I also don't qualify for scholarships offered to Americans because you must be a resident of America. I also don't qualify for scholarships at American schools in Europe because they are primarily given to those who have residency in America who want to go study abroad, not for those already living here. So, I fall into this strange gray area. I'm an American citizen with residency in Italy, and therefore exempt from both European and American scholarships because I already live here. It's weird, I know. I don't understand the logic either, but that's what I've been told by multiple institutions. To make matters even worse, European scholarships discriminate by age. Since I'm an adult in my mid-30s, I fall outside of most requirements even if there were scholarships I could access.

So, I feel stuck. I can go to school here at an Italian university, but I'd have to pay for it out of pocket, AND I'd be flat broke half-way through. I can't go to an American school in Italy because tuition per year is more than my entire savings. (And getting a loan is out of the question. I refuse to pay back a federal US loan on what will eventually be an Italian salary. It would take ages to pay that off, if ever.)

I'm also a US military veteran, and nearly every scholarship I can find for people like myself are limited to those who currently live and will be attending school in the US.

I feel like my options are nonexistent.

58,anonbutterflyrocks,1606328428,/r/college/comments/k0xkv8/how_i_won_an_academic_violation_case_and_how_you/,"**If you want to read the story that began this, I made this post in October:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jcuhw7/professor\_said\_i\_hacked\_into\_his\_computer\_to\_get/](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jcuhw7/professor_said_i_hacked_into_his_computer_to_get/)

Hey everyone. I come bearing good news. I ended up winning an academic dishonesty case against my professor, who claimed that I cheated on an Zoom administered exam because I answered a single question with an something that he didn't teach in class. He claimed I searched up my answer because he saw something similar online. This all started in October, when my professor held a meeting with me and tried getting me to confess to something I did not do: cheat. He then proceeded to report me to the college even after I explained my side of things to him and told him numerous times I didn't cheat and that he's making a mistake.

For all of October and most of November, I was utterly depressed. All of my hair fell out and I lost like 10 pounds, for real. Waking up every day felt horrible. I felt like I had a huge weight on my chest and I wouldn't be able to get it off, ever. I couldn't focus on anything this semester, friends, family, even my other classes. I couldn't even leave my room and talk to my parents, and whenever I did, I would cry because I wished something like this would've happened to me in high school or something, not college, because they would've been able to defend me. But in college, you're pretty much all alone. Parents can't do much but show you sympathy and reassure you. What will be the outcome? What will happen to me? Will I get kicked out of college? These would be the only things I would think about 24/7.

I'm a pre-med student and a cheating accusation could derail my entire track to medical school, my lifelong dream. I thought my life was over. Yeah, I know this sounds dramatic, but it really isn't dramatic when you're living through it. On top of that, I go to a really prestigious and expensive college in NYC, I felt like all of the money my parents worked so hard to save up and spent on tuition for me would've gone to waste if I didn't win this thing. Premed student or not, just being accused of something you didn't do while being completely innocent can ruin you, especially in college, where you're just starting to experience adulthood and independence, stuff like that.

After the professor pursued his case against me, I still didn't back down. I challenged his accusation and wrote out my appeal letter and sent it to the dean. I kept on going to his lectures, taking every single exam and submitting every single assignment and homework. I didn't miss ANY of that, and that's extremely important to do when you're faced with a false accusation like this. My professor stopped grading my work, though, and admitted he couldn't grade me fairly anymore because I was disputing his allegations. I reached out to everyone I could, the deans, my advisors, the department chair, to inform them of this. I was being treated like I was guilty by this professor, even while my case was pending.

After torturous weeks and weeks of waiting, I found out from my college's dean a few days ago that the case against me was dropped completely because my professor's claims were unreliable and his insufficient ""evidence"", which was an assumption, didn't make any sense. I had an incredible support system behind me throughout all of this, and I'm so glad my name was cleared. Just because of a stupid, careless mistake on my professor's side, my entire college career could have been ruined.

**So if you're falsely accused of an academic violation and you're innocent, DO THESE THINGS:**

1. During the initial meeting with your professor (if they offer one) to discuss the violation, make it clear that you didn't cheat, don't apologize for anything, explain your side clearly and calmly, and definitely communicate to the professor that you will be appealing the case if they decide to report you. **Don't let the professor take advantage of you,** because this is what happened to me. Had I defended myself properly, I wouldn't have been in this situation in the first place.
2. **APPEAL, APPEAL, APPEAL!** If the professor does end up reporting you, know that you have the right to appeal by your university. I'm pretty sure this applies to every single institution in the U.S, at least.
3. If you can afford an educational lawyer, definitely hire one. It's not necessary and they won't be able to directly defend your case, but it's nice to have someone who can help you write your appeal letters and come up with any evidence that you need to defend yourself.
4. Reach out to an academic advisor, the department head, the deans, whoever has some sort of power. Don't be embarrassed to inform them. The more people you have on your side from the beginning of the process, the better.
5. If there's an ombudsman/student representative in your university, TALK TO THEM. Set up a meeting and ask them to walk you through the process and what you have to do to protect yourself. They should even help you write your appeal letter. I didn't have an ombudsman at my college (weird, even though my college's law school is well known) but I had my advisor, class dean and the department chair on my side.
6. **Don't stop attending the classes** where you were accused of cheating in. Keep doing everything you would've normally done-- homework, tests, assignments, etc. Don't miss a single thing, seriously. If you do, it can make you look guilty, you'll look like you just gave up and don't care about your academics.
7. **Have patience.** Academic violation cases can unfortunately take a lot of time and you just have to wait to hear from the committee or whoever is going to review the case. Also, during the pandemic, there are a lot of academic integrity cases anyways because students are literally cheating left and right and getting caught red-handed, even over Zoom administered exams. However, there are other innocent students (like me) who didn't cheat and are being accused due to misunderstandings or just sheer negligence on the professor's side.
8. **Trust the process, and GET OFF REDDIT!!!** NO, your life isn't over. Breathe. Unfortunately I was an idiot and came to Reddit seeking help. I posted about my case (linked above) and desperately asked strangers for advice. Some people said that I'm not going to win the case and that my life is over. These comments really made me second-guess myself and my college. I thought that I would be convicted of something I didn't do, and that my college could indeed convict me of a false accusation. Turns out all of those negative comments are wrong.

Sorry for the long post but yeah, this is what happened. I could still sue my professor for defamation and mistreatment, but I don't think I will, because I don't care about him. It's really sad and unfair how some professors can get away with maltreatment and false accusations, ruining a student's life. But if you know didn't cheat, then don't worry, you will be fine. Remember to defend yourself and don't back down. If you did cheat and you got caught, sorry buddy, I don't know what to tell you. Actual cheaters deserve the consequences and that's all I'll say.

I hope this post was helpful. All hope is not lost. If you're convicted of something like this and you need someone to talk to or you need advice, I'd be more than happy to help you and share some of my wise wisdom haha.

I'll be doing a BA in Humanities, the Arts and Social Thought, but I'm planning to major in ethics and politics. By accepting this however, I turned down four international relations and geography courses from well known universities in the UK (UCL, King's, SOAS, QMUL), with cost mainly being the reason. Whilst financially I'm making a good decision, everything I've read has basically slated liberal arts degrees, and some people are judging me for accepting it, along the lines of ""I thought you were smarter/better than that, why are you getting a useless degree?"". 

The thing is I really want to get a post-graduate degree (most likely master's but possibly a phd) in an area related to international relations and development, and want to work the for UN or the civil service, so I'm viewing this liberal arts degree as a kind of stepping stone. A large chunk of graduates from the college I will be attending do go on to graduate school for areas like this (including UChicago, NYU, Oxford, SciencesPo etc), hence my interest in it. From my perspective, by accepting this offer and doing a liberal arts degree I can work and save more money, and put this towards doing a graduate degree, as well as coming out with minimal debt. The school is also really big on internships (compulsory to do a long one in third year and encouraged to shorter ones in second year) and study abroad programmes, and my scholarship would also cover these, so I would be able to apply to (and afford to attend) some interesting programmes, which I think could be really valuable, and override the fact I have a liberal arts degree if I have good experience.

At the same time, I'm scared about something changing? What if I decide suddenly I don't want to go to grad school/something happens so I can't? Am I now stuck with a useless, unemployable degree? Am I going to be the laughing stock of the academic world? Would I be better off doing a degree at one of the UK unis and just take the debt, because I'll be more employable if I don't go to grad school?

Also, since I will be commuting 30 miles going there then back 30 miles total 60 miles a day, ill prob be so tired and worn out that i wont have the energy to study and being a home with no freedom of a college student, it will just affect my performance in a really bad way. So med school would be impossible for my conditions even if I got a 3.9 or something i dont think my parents would even have the money to pay 250k for med or 400k for dental.

This job will also help me prepare for grad school, that's why I really need to keep this job.

I keep pleading with her to allow me to take the night class because if I take the day class instead, I will lose my job because I need to follow the strict schedule.

I somehow didn't inherit their intelligence but I went to a competitive high school and was able to pull off a decent ACT score and get into BU (after my parents proofread everything on my common app). But now here I am, a sophomore STEM major, and I don't really think I can handle it. My GPA is just hovering right around a 3.0 and I don't want to give up on my classes. But I keep getting Ds in classes everyone says are the easier ones and I just feel like I really can't do it. Some people have to be weeded out. The issue is that if I tried to switch now there's no way I'd be able to graduate in two years like I planned and I can't afford to go here longer than I have to. I'm not a hard worker but my major is decently interesting and there's no other major I'd rather do here anyway. I've also lived in the Boston area for my entire life and most of my friends and family live here or pretty nearby, but none of my family is from here and I deeply feel like an outsider. I'm dying to move somewhere else, but I have no idea how I'd afford it or where I'd go because I have no idea what career I want or could get after college (I'm not premed). I barely know anyone who lives in other cities so I'm terrified of being lonely and I have no experience with moving, but I just feel like I'm deeply not a New Englander. Honestly I don't really have much faith in getting a job after college. BU seems to be decently hard to get a good GPA, but still. I feel like it's hard to compete with people who have a better GPA. Also, my younger sister has dyslexia and my family might move so we can afford for her to go to private school. I know I'm so immature and selfish to be sad about this and this is what she needs, but secretly I've been fearing it so much since I've lived in the same town for almost my whole life and a lot of my best friends are still from my high school and it'd be hard to see them much again (I go home for breaks). I'm also in my first relationship and my boyfriend is way more into it than me which really freaks me out, but I can't bring myself to end it even if honestly some of the reason I'm still dating him is just to finally have a boyfriend and not be my stupid self people have looked down on my whole life (I do like him in the ways I should to some extent, which complicates things further). I'm worried long term I'll never be able to commit to someone and legitimately want to spend all my time with them more than anyone else since I like hanging out with a group of friends the most, but at the same time I want to get married and not be alone my whole life. I'm doing way too much stuff- balancing schoolwork with three clubs (no leadership), exercise, a volunteer position, an on campus job I can choose my hours for, trying to apply for summer internships I likely won't get, my relationship, seeing a bunch of friends that aren't all friends with each other, and still seeing my family semi-regularly/helping with my ten year old sister since I'm not very far from home. And I have terrible time management skills so I waste half the day away when it's incredibly important. I know I need to quit something, but there's nothing I can really quit. Here it is, almost 2 AM, I'm trying to make up the hours I said I did for my job last week, I flaked on my boyfriend today, and I have an 8AM chem lab tomorrow I haven't done the prelab for or last week's postlab. I just failed my orgo exam I crammed for and I'll have to lie to all my smart friends in the class as usual so they don't know how stupid I really am. I don't even know what I'll tell my parents. The worst part is that I know these are all such first world problems and I was given so much opportunity that I don't deserve when a lot of people don't get to go to college (I sound like such a shitty person in this but I really do care about other people and I see myself as worse than the average person), and I'm going to throw this expensive tuition away my parents are killing themselves to pay for away and never get a job and live with them until they die and then who even knows. I might seem like I have low self esteem, but I think I have reason to. I was born without any real talents in an area of success and I don't belong here at all. I don't know what to do. I'm sorry for going on and on and this is probably normal for a 19 year old to be unsure of their future, but I just feel like I'll be a total failure (you can probably tell by now interviews aren't going to save me). If anyone has any idea of how I could possibly turn any aspect of my life around, that would be much appreciated.

Really crappy system the administration has, but even the university president doesn't care enough to do anything about it. 

Anyways so I've been banned because I made a terrible mistake of burning a small stack of papers (around 100 pages) on fire in my shower. The moment I felt the heat from the papers, I turned the water on, but I didn't realise it'd create a lot of smoke, which a staff noticed and pulled the fire alarm in response to. 

There was ABSOLUTELY no damage to the shower, much less the building, yet it was deemed that I be suspended for two years. I appealed, and the consequences changed to a year ban from dorms. I did find this fair, but I'm in Washington DC and this is a very last minute revelation, and I can't find any housing off campus, especially with the expensive rents. 

I still have a week left to apply for my local community college back home. But this could lead to my losing my scholarship from my University. 

Or should I risk this week and keep looking for off campus residence, which will mean I have to loan even more money to be able to afford rent? 

To make matters even more risky, I'm deaf so I have my state's support with college tuition. If I don't take at least 12 credits this semester, I'll lost that support, which means I'll once again have to take out an even bigger loan.

My university doesn't do that. They keep whatever is left over. In my case, I have a full tuition scholarship but I still get financial aid, so there's 3k left over. I'm grateful I even get to go to college for free, but honestly that financial aid would've helped me drastically. I'm not that well off.

I've been using a laptop since I was 15 and it's starting to be really shitty. It shut down in the middle of an exam once (thankfully the professor reopened it for me) just to give you an idea (it shuts down a lot).

I also don't have a car. I think many people can understand why that's a major inconvenience, especially because I also work and am involved in multiple clubs/organizations. It doesn't just affect me but my mom as well because I have to take her car a lot of the time. Financial aid money also would've helped me in that regard.

The govt gives certain people aid for a reason. In my case it would be because I can't afford what a lot of people can, and paying for textbooks I can't find online for free is always something I have to worry about.

Anyways, my friend whose dad makes 200k a year, she is very well off and doesn't even work because her parents pay for all her shit and buy her whatever she wants/needs. Laptop? Done. Apple watch? Done. Car? Done. Whatever. You get the point. 

She says that it's ""unfair"" for other students to get their aid money back, because why should they get money for doing nothing. I told her that she can't talk about fairness because it's also ""unfair"" that she doesn't have to worry about money just because she so happens to be born to an upper class family, and she has done nothing to deserve money either.

I didn't take any GE classes because I could even afford the major classes. I don't plan on graduating from my local uni with a degree.

80,Jam3sConn3r,1578774830,/r/college/comments/enctwm/a_reminder_to_say_thank_you/,"My father is a good man. He is the best man I know, and I am immeasurably lucky to have had him guide me to where I am now in life, which is a freshman at a great university. He also went to college. He worked two jobs to pay for it himself while maintaining a good enough GPA to apply to law school, in which he also worked multiple jobs. I don't work while at school, but I do 40 hours a week in the summers. My father grew up poor. Really poor. Hispanic kid in 60s California and Illinois trying to make ends meet poor. 11 siblings that all ate the same thing every day and didn't complain because they knew how hard their parents worked to put food on the table poor. I grew up asking for ten bucks to drive through Culver's with my friends. I grew up asking for something else if the dinner he made me wasn't what I wanted. My dad worked from 6 am to 8 pm picking cucumbers in 80-degree heat when he started middle school. I got my own laptop when I started sixth grade. My dad works long days, sometimes six days a week, at his office and has prosecuted more cases than most of his coworkers combined over his career. I go to frat parties and get so drunk that I have to go the hospital. I woke up this morning in the ER with an IV winding its way down my arm and my clothes in a bag behind the bed I was in. I loathe myself. My father brought me up strong, showed by example what a man should be, raised up good men in my eyes, and talked about his love for God so strongly that when I was young that I wanted to be a priest. Sometimes, when the world seems very quiet to me, I like to take a moment to remember the stories he'd tell me of the amazing people he has been blessed to work with over the years. He would talk of the judge, an old Irish catholic from Boston with a presence bigger than the room. How he would talk, and everyone would listen, hanging on each syllable, even the men standing before him accused of murder or violent sex trafficking or drug running, they all stood before him enrobed in the thoughtful cadence of his voice as he doled out wisdom from his seat. He talked of things like justice, yes, every judge should, but he also talked of compassion, of thoughtfulness, of honor, of strength of character and mental fortitude. He sat on the bench as a judge, but he stood before the room as a man, a model of what one should strive to be. He loved his wife dearly for over forty years and always took the time to shake your hand, look you clearly in the eye,  address you as sir, and ask you how you were, even the young men who came before him accused of heinous acts received the same solemn dignity that I did when I came in to watch my father work on warm summer days when my daycare wasn't open. He died last year. Pancreatic cancer. He fought it till the end, but the end was bitter. I won't soon forget how my father cried for this man. All my father said to me when he got back from the funeral was, ""He was a good catholic, but a better man."" My father worked many cases that this judge presided over and they were good friends in private, he was almost a second father to my old man. My dad's real father died when I was in third grade. Alzheimer's. I had never met him. My father's side of the family lived in Texas and for some reason we had never visited. That was the first time I saw my father cry. It broke me. He spoke at the funeral, between quiet, reserved moments of thought. That was the first time I had ever truly paid attention when my dad told stories about growing up. He talked about his father's life. Making a living during the depression, fighting in the second world war, raising 11 children on a car factory worker's salary. Teaching his children the value of their faith and each other. Never letting them forget the value of a dollar or a dream. Showing the resourcefulness of an eighth-grade education and the passion of an immigrant with a belief in the ideals of America. I could tell from the way the room was packed that this man was more than just a father. That was what I thought then, but remembering my old man speaking through teary eyes before his family, I now realize the man laying in the casket before him was exactly that: a father. He was the very best thing a boy could have. A father, a giant, a pair of calloused hands tucking you into bed after they worked a 14-hour shift placing the door on new model Chryslers they could never afford. A man who smacks you across your ear when you talk to loud in church and a man who picks you back up after you fall trying to learn to ride the secondhand bike he saved up for 3 months to get you. The sort of man you spend your whole life trying to grow up into, but always feel like you're coming up just short. The sort of man I hope someday my kids might be able to look to, and the sort of man my father is to me. But I let that man down yesterday and the shame and guilt are almost more than I can bear. But they were also a choice I made, and my father raised me up to own the choices I make. Laying on that bed in the middle of the ER I felt like dying. Not from the alcohol or from the embarrassment of the bad choices I made suddenly flooding to the front of my mind as I started to remember the previous night, not even from the thought of the bill that was inevitably coming in the mail. Those were all my choice and things that I could and will own. No, I dreaded more than anything the thought of telling my father, the man whose eyes filled with tears dropping me off at one of the best universities in the world because I now had ""the opportunities he never did"" and who was so proud to be able to pay for my tuition that he had saved for so that I ""wouldn't have to work the same crumby night shifts at the CVS"" like he did. How could I do this to my old man, who had given up so much for me. The same man who stayed up late hours to help me with my math homework after work so that I could get into that summer program. The same man who never missed a single one of my stupid tennis matches and coached every basketball team I was ever on. The same man who quietly drove me home after bad losses because he knew the music just made me angrier. The same man who spent what felt like years teaching me how to cast a rod only to see me give up after I got no bites in the first fifteen minutes. He is a colossus and I spent my childhood living in his loving shade. Now as I stare at the yellow patient ID bracelet on my hand, part of me can't help but smile. Not because I'm proud of what I did, there is no redeemable aspect of my actions and this I know. I smile because I know just how much my father loves me, and just how much I love him. I began writing this because I didn't have an outlet to put my emotions, a thousand miles from my home. I thought I understood how I felt and that the phrase ""I want to die"" pretty much encapsulated it. Now, more than anything, I want to live. To live to be the man my father wants me to be, to be the type of man I want to be. I'm still racked with conflict in my mind: sadness, regret, self-pity, disgust, and anger are all swirling through my thoughts. I'm still terribly afraid of the disappointment I know my father will feel. But I am strengthened by knowing I am my father's son. His love has always been my armor in this world, and it has enabled me to do great things. As I leave the world he prepared for me and start my life outside of his influence I am comforted by the knowledge that he raised me with every ounce of effort, courage, compassion, and conviction that he had, and, that while I will inevitably make mistakes, including many bad ones like last night, I have what I need to pick myself up, dust off my shoes, adjust the saddle and get back on the horse. No matter how many times it throws me. Now, I don't know if I will ever find the time or courage to show my father this, but I hope after you read this you can take some time to reflect on how much someone in your life has given you. Take the time to appreciate the small things they may do for you every day or the things they do for you without knowing it themselves. I hope you read this and feel like maybe you too can stand on the shoulders of giants like my dad, or your dad, or your mom, or your older brother, best friend, neighbor or cousin. We all have giants in our lives who raise us up to more than we thought we could be. Finding yours is important, but maybe more important is standing tall for others and making room on your shoulders for someone else's giant. So, if anyone needs a 5'8"" giant, I'll be studying for my calc final and trying my best to stand tall in the library basement.

I decided to attend my state uni since it was known to be the most prestigious in the state and it was very much affordable. I managed to get a very very generous financial aid package that covers almost all of my yearly tuition, and since I have a part time work study job, my parents have decided to not worry about paying for my college tuition (except for dorm things). So thankfully, they've not had to worry about it which I'd prefer for it to stay that way. 

Thing is, when I looked at my financial statement in the campus bursa, I saw that there was a charge of ~$711 for tuition which remained after financial aid applied, which I was unaware of the cost till now. I looked it over and realize this might be how it is for the next four years, not even my work study and spending habits could cover the cost each year. The reason I didn't get a loan was because my parents did not allow for it since it builds up interest rates over time according to them, so we decided it would be handled by us (or me in this case). 

And just recently, I've had to drop a course I was inevitably going to fail for the semester which meant I had to pay back ~$800 for dropping it since I'm under a scholarship in-state. And I can't even afford to pay that back right now which means I might be temporarily barred from the scholarship next semester until I pay it back. Even worse, my parents don't know that I had to drop a course and was charged a lot for it. 

I've looked into Boro but they require a 3.0 GPA and I'm only in my first semester so I haven't gotten back my final GPA for fall, and I'm not sure I could even pull a 3.0 since I'm struggling in CS right now. And I'm not sure if University loans would be a good idea due to excess charges and interest. 

Is this a good idea? My parents would not be happy with this but I'm sure I could pay it off quick given the field I'm looking to go into (cybersecurity). I'd like to be able to do this without letting them know and dealing with this on my own if that's possible since I wouldn't want to burden them. If so, I'd estimate about $6000 which I think shouldn't be too bad. Thank you.

If you're wondering why I believe I can't afford college, it's for a few reasons. The plan is to go to a state public university. To begin, I'll be eligible for a $2k scholarship but that's not much. Second, my parents make over $100k, so I'm really not eligible for much aid at a cheap 4-year school. And my parents also *absolutely refuse* to co-sign for any private loans, or Parent Plus Loans.

I hope you all are good.**I live in East Asia and I'm 22 years old**(I will be 23 this year). I got enrolled in a business school in the country I'm living in because I couldn't go abroad and I didn't get into some good schools because I couldn't meet some criteria (mainly language issues). So, I got into the school in 2017 so now I'm in my 2nd year.

When I first enrolled, I asked them if I can transfer my credits to any other universities and they said that I can. So I continued for 2 years and now that I wanted to transfer and when I applied to other universities, **the universities told me that they can't accept any of my credits because my school is unaccredited**. I feel like I was placed in the darkness for 2 years.

The reason I want to transfer in the first place is because of the tuition fees which is so extremely high. So this is how it is, **there are 4 semesters (having 2 and a half month)**.Â **Per semester you can take 20 credits, so basically you can take 4 courses and each course is worth 5 credits. Now each course costs $2000. So, 4 courses x $2000 = $8000 per semester.** And **to graduate you need to have 180 credits** and so far **I have like around 45 credits** because each semester I couldn't take more than 2 courses because of the cost. I could only afford paying $4000. And for each course there are like only about 20 hour of lectures. And the lectures are always shortened and they are so poor. The exams are also not well structured. I feel like I'm learning nothing.

I feel honestly down, mentally and emotionally weak because of how worthless it is to continue in my current school. After talking with the other universities, they told me that I need to start from the freshman and honestly that will be the hardest decision. Coming from an Asian family, my family cares about status and all that. Everyone knows that I'm in my second year even though my school goes by the credit system. I don't know what to do, **I can't tell my parents because they are mentally and physically suffering a lot already and this situation is going to stress them out even further. I have 3 more siblings, 1 is going to go to a university this year.** So if I start from freshman I will be with my brother/sister who is now 18 years old. This is a shame in my community and I will be called a ""loser"". I feel so lost. I don't know what decision I should make.

**I would like to state now what I want to do in the future, career and where my passion lies. I'm very passionate about designing and creative fields that include, UI/UX designing, graphic designing, design psychology, product designing, filmography, video production, photography and coding**. The creative fields always bring fascination and excites me. So besides, my studies I have always been involved in learning all these by myself. And **in the future, I would want to create a company either that's a graphic-design company, a clothing company, or software related.**I'm not sure yet, but I have interests in those areas. So I don't know where and how I can pursue all these because there's no university here that offers these fields. So I'm learning all by myself through youtube and other materials online.Â

At the moment, I don't really know what to do. Whether I should change to another school, stay here in the current one or dropout. I don't know what will be the best and if there are any school for the creative fields I mentioned above.

If for some reason the loan doesn't come in on time and I don't pay it (Which I definitely can't afford), then I'll be dropped from all of my other summer courses that start on June &amp; July and will get a hold on my final grade for the Maymester.

Here's my situation: my parents make too much money for me to qualify for any need based assistance from the schools or the government. My parents won't be helping me pay for my tuition either. So I'm basically on my own. 

Now if I go to a commuter public school, I did the math, I'd be able to work a part time job and afford the entire time with no debt. If I do a community college then I'd be able to pay for the two years and have nearly enough money left for a year in the go-away state school. The negatives to this though is that the commuter schools, especially COMMUNITY COLLEGES, are known to have less of a social environment than dorm schools. 

For a little while now, I've been wanting to go away for multiple reasons:

-I'm honestly CANNOT STAND being around to be at home around my mother anymore, I see an onset of mental illness that might worsen her behavior in the coming years and I don't want to be around that

-My high school is so boring and I feel like I've missed out on so many ""high school experiences"" I look at other people's high school and they have fun but NOTHING, I MEAN NOTHING, ever goes on in my school.

-I want to be around more of my own race, I feel like such an outcast at my high school (some of you guys may not understand this point but it has really affected my experience a lot)

I feel that after how my four years were at my current high school, I honestly deserve to have a better next four years. Besides that, I truly can't stand my mom and I don't want to feel a certain way at home after I turn 18.

The cons to this though is that I'd probably have to take out a loan and a part time job wouldn't be enough to pay it off before school ends.

I need some honest advice because I'm really stuck on what to do. I'm still 80% leaning towards going away but also still thinking about how beneficial a commuter school would be.

-I do NOT qualify for FASFA. Only have once, and that was when my younger brother first started college 2 years back. Family makes *too much* and I'm only 23 still living at home and paying my own expenses. 

-I pay for my courses myself. 0 help from anyone or my parents at that(nothing new here). 

-I'm doing vocational school at this moment. 

I've decided to go back to school, and go back FT. I've earned my Associates 2 years ago and decided to wait on my Bachelors, due to financial circumstances. Instead of going to Uni, I decided to go back to my former community college and earn a certification in Electrical work(very similar to my college major), which is an 11 month program. 

Before I began school, I was working a nice FT office job and making a decent wage. I decided that's not what I wanted to do with my life. I saved up enough money to get me through the first semester of school, but that's only the first semester. 

The spring term has opened up for payments and is quickly approaching, but I have &lt;$400 in my savings right now. I've put my tuition on a payment plan and forwarded that plan to charge my Visa credit card at $335 a month for 4 months(this was for fall). Spring is going to be the same price with the exact same payments, but I'm afraid I cannot afford it. 

My current PT job is complete crap, and I'm looking for a second job. If I can find a second job by the time payments are due, then I'll be able to afford the payments no problem, but at this moment in time I cannot.

Scholarships. Let me just say, they're just like playing the lottery, but for free. I've applied for one and just got informed I did not win anything. I'm looking for others, but it's not as easy as I expected it to be. They all have specific requirements that have to be met, and I can't lie and say I have those requirements(live in X state, be X age, be this, etc). All the ones for my state, I keep getting denied because of my qualifications for FASFA are not met. 

Now I've looked at loans in the past, but I have never been a fan of them. The amount I'd need to make it through the next 8 months would only be $3,000, but I don't know how that would work out. I don't want to be charged hefty interest rates and I want to pay it back while I'm still in school. What to do??

It is my last semester of my senior year now, and my tuition has not been covered... AGAIN. I told my mom about it, and she told me that she ""forgot"" to set up loans for me or financial aid or whatever and its past the due date, but previously she had told me I don't qualify anymore since she got remarried to another rich guy. She basically told me its not her problem and to figure it out myself. My dad did pay for my summer internship class this past semester, but my parents had a huge fight about it first. He also just paid for a new laptop for me that he is forcing me to pay him back for, so I have a strong feeling he will say no to helping me and have another horrible fight over the phone with my mom, and my mom will probably resent me for it if he gets verbally abusive again. So now i'm scared I'm not going to make it to graduation.

On top of all this, I had to move out of my apartment because of a bad roommate, and my mom told me to move back home. It has really put a strain on my relationship with my wonderful bf of 3 years too, since I lost some of my freedom to be with him whenever I want. We even secretly lived together for a year too and it was amazing. Anyway my mom is now always upset at me about little things that aren't even my fault most of the time, and wants me to pay rent. I would be fine with that, but my dad has started giving me way less money than usual every month so that she won't get any more of his money than the child support for my sister he barely pays. 

I really don't know what to do and my anxiety is just getting worse and worse. I am almost always crying about it if I am alone too long... especially when I need to be working on my artwork for my senior art show. My bf and I have been talking about moving into an apartment together after I graduate. Then I can get out of this mess of a family and hopefully go to grad school for my masters in graphic design, but I still have to make it another few months until then, and idk if I can even afford that... my mom also says she is totally on board with us moving together since she ""can't afford my lifestyle"" (whatever that means), even though she also always makes a point to tell me to NEVER marry him.  Its like even though my mom says she agrees, she also makes me doubt it will even work out by saying things like how my bf is not who she would have picked for me (what is this, the 1500s?) and how it will suck when we break up and are stuck living together. I know that is a possibility but it sucks that she has no faith in us, or anyones relationships really. She also just told me she asked my dad over the phone what he thinks about me and my bf living together and he said he does not approve at all and would cut off all money for me.

I am feeling completely lost right now and I don't know what to do anymore.  My parents are too selfish to help me with anything, but at the same time try to control me to the point where I feel every decision I make is wrong. I am just trying to graduate and be an adult and a professional artist, but I also have to deal with all this garbage. I am now terrified for my future and my parents are making me feel like I am suffocating.

103,avocadoambassador,1535218826,/r/college/comments/9a8l0s/to_transfer_or_not_to_transfer_again/,"Hello my fellow broke as students, Just wanted to get your guys input on the aspect of transferring to a different college(s).

&amp;#x200B;

 I started college 2014 and was suppose to graduate in 2018. But since I got pushed back two years, I will be graduating in 2020. So far I have attended Loyola University Chicago for 2 years and a local community college around where I lived with my grandparents for about a year or so. Just last fall I transferred to Marquette University (Fun Fact: Jimmy Butler when here!).

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons why I transferred out from: 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;LUC:  I did enjoy this place, I was able to make new connections with the staff and faculty on campus and had made good friends here.....but I transferred out because I did not receive enough financial aid and it was CRAZY expensive...(if you are wondering about scholarships? Yes, I had applied for some and got some...still not enough).

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Community College: I loved this place as well. My peers who I had classes with, taught me that you DO NOT have to finish college within a goddamn given time. EVERYONE finishes at their own pace. I transferred out from here to be closer to my parents in MKE (Because they wanted me to and I had no choice).

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;MU: I also Love this school for the programs that they offer. I felt like the professors were actually teaching me something during their lectures. They also  show how much they care about their students. I also finally decided and stick to a major and minor that I really like. Here I was able to get a good amount of financial aid but not enough (definitely still expensive). 

&amp;#x200B;

I am grateful that my parents have been helping me pay for the 4 years that I've been in school. However, they are giving me a hard time last semester with helping me pay the tuition ( my parents are not willing to help me take out loans). 

&amp;#x200B;

Moral of the story that I had learn the hard way: 

&amp;#x200B;

1) Go to community college first. SAVE that MOOLA.

2) Don't go to a private school if you can't afford it...

3) Don't listen to your parents. You do you boo. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I am deciding to transfer out once again, But to a public uni. Do you guys think there is a problem when a student decides to transfers in and out of universities constantly?

There would be a point where I'd have to exclusively rely on financial aid and tuition goes up at 6% a year. Eventually I wouldn't be able to afford it with federal loans. So I research ways to at least make it out with a degree. The best I can find is probably WGU business degree (I read about people easily finishing 30+ credits/term) or FHSU general studies where I'd just have to take 30 random credits from there and I'm done.

I need some support on what's been going on right now and I don't know where to get it aside from a therapist (my friends can't understand my situation, I'll explain why). 

I'm poor as fuck. All the time. I make between $300-$400 every two weeks working a part-time job but all the money goes into bills and food. I've seen a financial advisor at my bank and I'm working on improving my finances but I'm always poor as fuck.

I live a shitty situation at home with my mother. We have a disastrous relationship, we fight so much. Since our last fight (last week-end, after which I also had to go to the hospital because she stretched my ligament on my finger) my mom wants me out. I've never been able to move out before because I was not comfortable financially. Now, luckily both my parents will want to afford my rent. Prior to that I also applied to my government loans to be considered in a special situation (due to family problems and violence) so I could get more government loans but my application was rejected by them. So I have just enough loans to pay for tuition and textbooks.

I know it should be a good thing that my parents will pay a rent for me but I'm still overstressed and feeling blue. I'm so afraid of going homeless for some reason. I'm stressed because I want to keep my valuable possessions (I have close to 200 books with me - I'm a huge reader and I study philosophy - and a very few sentimentally valuable objects that I'm afraid to lose). I've never moved out before, I don't know how any of this works.

I've been looking for a place since yesterday and I don't find anything. I'm hoping I will fall in love with one of the places I'm visiting tomorrow but maybe they won't be as good as I anticipate them to be. 

Lastly, the reasons I don't really talk about this with my friends is because they can't really understand my situation. Somehow I ended up having best friends who are all loaded, but more importantly their parents help them for anything and support them more than mine do. My ex was also loaded (she was given a condo before she graduated) and now it fucks with me to think how lucky she was to be in this situation. Everyone around me has it better and I'm constantly broke. Every friend I know who lives on their own has their parents helping them. I can't even trust that my parents will always pay my rent, that's how bad my situation is with them.

I'm scared that because I'll be on my own someday I'll have to drop out to afford living on my own. I don't want to do that because college is all I have. My passion is in a classroom and at the library.

It's to the point I'm trying to convince myself to change field and go into law or something that has more potential to pay but deep down I know I'm made for what I'm studying and what I want to be at first (professor - do research).

Anybody has been in my shoes before by any chance? I have a shitty life and I just wish I could deal with this big change with less fear and anxiety.

Umm, the entire point of applying for financial aid is because we can't afford classes. It's a small school and a Pell Grant alone covers tuition and fees, but we don't have $1400 a semester to fork over a piece. I can't exactly set up any payment plans, we're already living paycheck to paycheck.

So, my tax return got messed up and it turns out my university never got my tax info. My parents got our family accountant to re-submit my tax return a few days ago, but it will take the IRS a few weeks to process it and then it will take my university a few more weeks to process and a few more to put together my financial aid package. All of that needs to be done by August 20th, when my tuition is due. I definitely can't afford to pay the amount it would cost, and basically I won't be able to go to class this semester (or potentially the entire school year) if this stuff doesn't get done in time.

I have contacted the financial aid office, but they said that getting an extension on the deadline is unlikely and to contact them closer to August 20th to see if I can get one.

If I can't go to class, I'd like to be able to get an internship instead. I had been contacting a company about an internship for this past summer, which fell through, but they had asked if I was available for the fall. I said I wasn't because of classes, but I could contact them and see if they have any positions available.

Should I start contacting companies and applying for internships/jobs now? I'd hate to wait and not be able to get an internship if it turns out I won't get financial aid, but I also don't want to suddenly turn down a company if I do get financial aid. I especially don't want to have a poor relationship with the company I had contacted before, since they are in a convenient location and a professor had recommended that I contact them. Also, should I explain to them why I won't be taking classes this year?

With the inability to afford any kind of prep school on our budget, he'll likely go to a public school in a rural area (town of 2300 people, Midwest).

I'm currently making around $40k a year and my wife is a stay at home mother. We're incredibly blessed to be in the sort of situation we are in and to be honest, I feel we've kind of broken the idea that Millennials can't afford anything. At the ages of 24 a piece, we pay our way for everything, house, cars, phones, almost nothing is handed to us. This is of course a result of being careful financially and having our priorities in check but moving on...

I did a little searching for colleges and to my disappointment, I could have gotten full ride to several decently sized state schools had I been guided a little better. I won't blame my parents for everything but I had no guidance of any kind and I didn't end up doing anything after high school. In my searching I thought it'd be hilarious to look up what it would take to go to an Ivy league school. I feel like I'm being thrown for a loop.

I'm thinking ahead for my son. I have very little doubt I won't be making at least 70k+ by the time he's ready for college. So by definition of the Princeton site, he could be granted full tuition and 71&amp;#37; rooming and I'd be responsible for the rest. Seeing this for the first time, it reminded me of a time where I thought I was on hidden camera. I still do not believe this is true, I HAVE to be missing fine print somewhere.

But okay, it's true, what sort of academic merit will he need in order to be accepted? Considering just the size of our town and the school he'd be going to, I'm almost certain he'd have to be nothing short of perfect. I don't want to put a ton of pressure on my son to achieve this, but I definitely want him knowing that this is an option once he's able to understand.

113,JereBear_2281,1531151641,/r/college/comments/8xcy1m/any_advice_on_my_situation/,"Hello everyone,

Not sure this is the right place for this but I'm going to try.

I need some help, and it's a long story but I'll keep it as short as possible. 

I just finished my freshman year of college, and now I'm worried that I won't have enough financial aid to ride out until the end of my education. I come from a family that is very mixed in it's financial status, as in my father was making absolute bank until he lost his job in 2009 due to mass layoffs which effectively ruined my parents lives, but he's also in consideration for a job that'll pay around $85,000 a year, so that would put them, and possibly by extension me, in a very good financial situation. But I've learned that when planning things it's always best to prepare for the worst, so let's just forget I mentioned that potential new job lol 

Anyways, the college I attended for the 2017 - 2018 school year cost roughly $22,000 a year with room and board, which is a necessity as it's a three hour drive from where I live. So, considering that my degree would require me to attend for five years, that'll roughly be a grand total of $110,000, and I just found out that an undergrad, who is still a dependent, can only take out up to$39,000 in government student loans. About $11,000 of that was used this past year, with grants/free aid covering the rest besides another $5000 that slipped through the cracks, which my parents ended up covering by taking out a loan that they can't afford. So that leaves me with a maximum of $28,000 in government loans and whatever grants and other free aid I get offered to cover $88,000 of college tuition. Now, looking back at how my financial aid for 2017 - 2018 worked out, and considering that my EFC went up a ton just because my sister moved out, my Higher Education award, which everyone gets, has dropped from $5000 to a little over $2000, things aren't looking very good there. Oh, and there's also the issue of your student loan eligibility decreasing every year that you're in school(I haven't fact checked that myself, buy I remember a financial advisor telling me that). 

Also, I've also been an average to slightly below average student when it comes to subjects that aren't within my interest, no matter how hard I work. All the way from 1st grade to my freshman year of college, if it wasn't related to music, art, writing or history, I would suck at it. This left me with a rather mediocre high school GPA, and things only improved slightly during my first year of college. So because of this, my odds of getting scholarships are slim to none, not to say that's kept me from applying, though. Oh, and because I'm a white male from an all white family, it seems like the entire college system assumes that I don't need any help and that I'm already at a much higher advantage than everyone else. Lol. 

So in terms of financial aid, things look pretty damn grim. There's also the option of using as much financial aid as I possibly can, and then applying for private loans, but there's no guarantee I would even get approved for them, and that would leave me at an absoluye, best situation, bare minimum of $50,000 in total debt, if I'm the luckiest person in the world. In reality it'd probably end up being closer to $110,000, maybe around $80,000. And I'm not sure that I want to take on all of that for a career that could write possibly pay sub-$30,000 a year starting out in a seemingly dying field. 

Which segways me into informing you that my current degree path is for a Music Education degree, which I would use to become a high school band director. As far as I'm aware, the only true passion I've ever had was for high school marching band, and to a lesser extent concert band. I never really had any other activities or groups where I felt like I belonged. I tried a couple different sports and a few different clubs, but none of them resonated with me. But I loved marching band and I excelled there, having earned the highest ranks in student leadership within the program. Marching band gave me the same competitiveness factor that you could get from sports, taught me valuable lessons, and gave me an overall sense of purpose. That's why I want to become a high school band director; so I can keep doing what I love while also helping new young people find a passion for it.

Now that all sounds fine and dandy, but when you realize that a high school band director will probably make scraps starting out, sometimes even less than other new educators, and the fact that school systems have been cutting music programs from public school curriculum for a while now, and are still doing so, it starts to seem like a much less viable and worthy option to out $80,000 worth if debt towards, even if it is my passion. There's also the fact that my main drive for this is for the love of the music meets competition aspect, and I'm not sure if someone who is only in it for the competitiveness should be teaching students. 

Although this is my only passion that I've discovered, I'm aware that it's not my only option. Hell, I never even considered that a life-long career. My plan was to ride that out until I was 50 or so and then start my own instrument sales and music lesson business. So keeping that in mind, I've also been toying around with the idea of going to a more local college that I can drive to everyday and pursuing a business management degree with a minor in music. Other interests and skills that I'm not sure what to do with are good-great writing skills, pretty okay visual art skills(mainly drawing), and being totally okay with doing hard work with my hands, getting dirty, and just doing ""tough guy"" work in general. I've also always enjoyed creating things and using my imagination. 

So what do I do? Do I follow my only real passion and try to attain that, even though I know I could be cut short and ruined financially before even attaining my goals? Or should I look for something else that I can pursue that matches my other skills and interests? I just feel so lost and confused right now.

Thanks for any help! 

Edit: Should probably mention that less than 10 colleges in my state offer Music Ed, and they're all at least two hours away, and none of my family leaves near any of them.

I'm going to breakdown how I saved close to $14,000 over my last 3 years, keeping in mind I'm talking about life expenses, not college tuition fees.

Coffee:

College and coffee go hand in hand, most of our daily routines consists of a quick Starbucks run. However most of these coffee stores overcharge big time for coffee. The average coffee will cost around 20 cents to make in a chain franchise, but you pay $3.50. So if you have a cup of coffee 5 times a week. That's around $900 you spend in a year provided you only have 5 cups a week. However what you should do is make your own coffee at home every morning, buy some high quality coffee powder and for around 25 cups you pay around 20 dollars(provided you use something high end, cheaper obviously if you use those crappy 3-in-1's or some no name which equates to around $0.80 per cup of coffee. So if you were to use your at home coffee powder you would save close to $700 per year/ 5 cups of coffee per week.

Clothes:

Ok now during my early days in college I used to be big into jackets, like as a college student I would wear jackets and sweatpants everywhere I go, literally EVERYWHERE, whether that be to the mall, to meet my parents even to sleep. However in my head, spending $250 on a Nike Tech Fleece Combo was absurd at the time and what I did was end up buying about 4 jackets from Target and 4 sweatpants from Walmart, however I found that these clothes were often tearing on me and that after a few washes they felt like sandpaper. In total, over the span of my Freshman year I spent close to $1000 on jackets and sweatpants from different brands due to the fact that after just about two-three weeks of spending I would end up refusing to wear it because it just felt rubbish and used to LITERALLY tear my skin up. So what I did during my sophomore and junior year was, I bought three sets of Nike Tech Fleece, two from outlet stores for around $120 each and one set for $250 because it was brand new all-black color, and until today I am still using that, so I saved close to around $1500 on just sweatpants and jackets alone, and I used this same mentality for every other piece of clothing I bought ranging from t-shirts to socks, so I would estimate on clothes alone I would have saved at a minimum, $4000. And not to say I only buy quick fashion brands like Nike, you can still afford to buy the nice designer stuff and SAVE money for example, instead of buying ten pairs of jeans like most people do from True Religion or Uniqlo I just bought two pairs of YSL jeans off Grailed and saved a lot there and those jeans are perfect. 

Transport:

God gave you legs use them as much as you can. I'm being serious, okay if your house is a 20 minute walk from your college just WALK it. Seriously, a bus fair ticket or train ticket will cost you around $1.50. Now $1.50 there and another $1.50 back costs around $750 per year. Try your level best to walk and if it's really really far then walk as far as you can THEN take a bus or train so you can save as much as you can because now you're in college your income is limited. And on the days you go out with your friends try your best to ask for a carpool. Over the span of 3 years I would say I saved at a minimum $1500

Books:

NEVER buy new books and NEVER rent books too. If you can't find a free copy of your book online just find a used copy of it even if it has a bit of scribbles in it and if a PDF edition costs much less then I suggest you save for an iPad or something and bring that iPad everywhere you go since you can store your textbooks on that. I saved close to $3500 on textbooks, and that includes getting myself an iPad which also benefits me in other ways so it's a win-win

Recreational fun:

If you do what to have fun with your friends, NEVER bring a credit card. In fact try your best to never own a credit card, debit cards are safer because you have a limit. Whenever you are out with your friends, bring cash and cash only, and that's not too say bring all your cash, make sure you budget yourself based on your financial situation. If you receive only $300 from your parents monthly, don't be stupid and bring $150 in one serving with your friends. I myself have a tendency of spending like there's no tomorrow when I'm not given a limit so doing this probably saved me a lot more then I would like to comfortably admit.

Healthcare:

Get insurance. PERIOD, it will benefit you if anything happens and although it may cost a fair amount try your best to go for the BEST insurance possible as you really could potentially save tens of thousands just by doing that, seriously I have a friend who because she did not have insurance had to pay close to $50,000 for surgery that a simple $200 monthly insurance would have covered.

Haircuts, Tattoos and Piercings:

Before I came to college I was perfectly clean, had a decent haircut, no piercings and no tattoos. By the time I left I had 4 stomach tattoos, one leg tattoo and one chest tattoo. And two piercings, overall this cost me a lot of money because I went to some of the most established tattoo artists all across the US such as Romeo Lacoste and etc. Because a one time high investment for something that will be on me until I die will costs a lot less then getting it from a shady tattoo artists and paying about $3000 for laser surgery when I regret it in two months time. 

Overall that's a guideline, I can always do a part 2. Just remember, more for less isn't always better than less for more.",college,ULTIMATE COLLEGE MONEY SAVING GUIDE,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8vhy02/ultimate_college_money_saving_guide/,1530549504.0
116,michiharuharu,1528671197,/r/college/comments/8q4mr1/your_opinion_on_students_who_crowdfund_money_for/,"A video showed up in my YouTube playlist recently by a YouTuber (121k subscribers) who set up a gofundme page to get money for her college tuition because the private schools she applied for did not offer her enough financial aid. Some of the schools include NYU, Chapman, LMU, and American University of Paris. 

She wants to major in communication/media and has already completed 2 years of her bachelor degree. She is also a California resident and claims that since she did her first school out of state, she is low priority for transferring to all CA schools (she applied to a bunch year or so ago and got rejected from all of them). Thus, she has only applied to private universities in large cities. Additionally, she can't (and also won't) take out the loans necessary fot these private universities with small financial aid packages (she hasn't stated what each school has offered her besides stating it's not a full ride), so she is asking her viewers to donate towards her college expenses. So far she has raised a little over $3000.

I'm wondering what your opinion on this is? I get being able to take out loans, but sometimes it's necessary and she wants her degree so bad then she shouldn't be so picky on where she wants to go. All of her college related videos are her complaining she can't afford college, but states she's not asking for sympathy. She has been able to live abroad, travel, and moves around often. She put her college on hold while she did those things, so now she's kicking herself in the butt for not being able to afford college.

117,elizqqq,1524095336,/r/college/comments/8dac16/should_i_transfer/,"Hey - I just wanted some opinions on my situation.

I currently am finishing my sophomore year at a good top 20 university. I'm doing fine academically - I have a 3.9 GPA. The problem is that I am not even remotely happy. I have spent the past probably 6 months considering transferring to my decent but lower ranked state school.


Some reasons I am considering this:

1) I am still pretty unsure academically of my direction and feel constrained by the need to graduate in 4 years since I wouldn't want to take on additional years since tuition is so incredibly high - at my state school, with in state, I could totally afford to take my time a bit (since tuition is like 1/4 as mine currently is), and maybe even take a semester to study abroad (something I am dying to do).

2) socially I am not doing so great - the person who I consider my best friend thinks I'm too clingy (plus I have realized that they are really not that great a person but distancing myself from them would be hard since I am living with them next year). Also, a lot of the people at this school give off the vibe of snobby rich kid. I know socially things would only be harder as a transfer but honestly at this point I just wanna focus on my studies and I do know some people at my state university.

3) I am incredibly homesick and would love to be closer to home (If this was the only reason, I would not consider transferring because I know how important independence is)

4) in-state tuition is like 1/4 of what I'm paying now



Reasons for staying:

1) I'm on the varsity track team here but would be able to play it at my state school (which would suck to have to quit because even though I'm not a huge fan of my team, I love the sport and my coach).

2) I've already invested like 100k into this school in tuition (gratefully payed by my parents)

3) For me, transferring feels like giving up. Like I couldn't handle being at an intense university and instead came running home to my parents. My current school had a 97% retention rate so what is so wrong with me that I somehow can't like it here?

4) My current school is medium size, state school is massive which is kinda scary.

5) (and probs the biggest) what if this would end up being the biggest regret of my entire life? What if I absolutely detest going to my state school? (Not that I'm at all happy right now, it's just I feel like I may be getting caught up in the grass is always greener paradox and somehow end up more miserable)

120,knightruby_94,1515301800,/r/college/comments/7ooqdh/my_advisors_are_flaking_on_my_class_schedule/,"I'm an international student from Canada and I go to a private school in Arizona that is just starting to expand its programs and campus. So far I've been there for a year (I transferred in) and I'm considered to be a senior on campus. Last semester (Fall 2017) I was discouraged from taking out the Sallie Mae loan by my father (since its a high interest loan) and told to apply for a federal loan from Canada and that I could pay off the rest of the money in installments since the Canadian loan would only cover half my tuition. I had explained this to my advisor who said that that would be fine. So I go through the semester applying for my federal loan and trying to contact my advisor for when it would be the best time to enroll in a payment plan and I can't reach her all semester. Near the end (like a week before the semester ends) she tells me I can't enroll in a payment plan because I'm an international student and by their policy I'm not allowed to pay in installments. She literally demanded that I pay the remaining tuition around 7K in full. Neither my parents, husband, nor myself have that kind of money laying around. She also told me that she could have worked out a payment plan for me if I had come earlier in the semester (which I had tried doing, I was completely upfront with her about my situation) I was forced to apply for the Sallie Mae loan and my advisor told me that once it was approved I would be re-instated for classes for the upcoming Winter semester (since they were dropped due to the fact that I had a 7k balance). 

However after the loan was approved my advisor was MIA again and the classes were not re-instated. I caught up with her after New Years on Jan 3rd and she basically told me she couldn't put me into new classes unless if I signed up for a payment plan or paid Winter semester's tuition in full. I asked her how to apply for the payment plan and then she got all weird and wen't ""how much can you afford for a down payment"". It was all super sketchy and there was no paper trail of any kind regarding this ""payment plan"". I walked out of her office and applied for Sallie Mae again for the Winter semester. The next day my advisor was MIA again so I had to contact her manager who removed the tuition hold off of my account but said it was too late in the semester to register for classes by myself and that my advisor had to do it. 

 I told the manager which classes I required and she said she forwarded the information to my advisor and that she would get it done. I emailed the advisor for confirmation and received an automated message that she was gone. Her manager then told me that she would be working on my issue from home. 3 days have passed and my classes have not been re-instated. I emailed the manager like 50 times and all I got was ""she is working on it"" or ""she can get you scheduled"". No body is telling me where my advisor is in the scheduling process. No body is telling me when or if these classes can get scheduled. It's Saturday night right now and school starts on Monday. I have no idea what to do. I saved all the emails from the advisor and her manager. Does anyone else find this to be sketchy?

122,Codiac500,1514700987,/r/college/comments/7n6zyg/how_can_i_get_this_f_off_my_transcript_i_dont/,"To give some context, I'm a freshman Computer Science major that just completed my first semester attending a University on an academic scholarship that provides full tuition, food, and room (up to traditional housing price). The rules as I remember them for keeping my scholarship is that I must maintain above a 3.2 GPA and be a full time student (12-16 credit hours a semester) Computer Science 1 is the class I failed. I have a decent understanding of Comp Sci basics because I originally learned C a little through 10th and 11th grade in highschool then took an AP class (Computer Science Principals, taught in Java) my senior year. I passed the AP exam and could have skipped comp sci 1 but I chose not to because it and the following classes were taught in a language I hadn't yet learned (C++) and I felt it would be an easy A.

I took Computer Science 1 this semester and was doing good in the class overall. I made A's and B's and 1 C on some simple online quizzes he had, a high B on the midterm, an 84 on the final, and missed one quiz (I had forgotten about it while attending a Hackathon, ironic right?). So the issue comes with this final project I had messed up on. I did the project correct short of two issues I noticed (didn't verify user input and didn't finish commenting the code all the way through) but all other aspects of the fairly long project worked fine so far as I could tell. It wasn't an especially hard project. Well, I didn't submit it right away because I was cleaning it up and, as I said, commenting the code (explaining what parts did what so it was easy to read). The day it was due I was commenting it, when I remembered I had a Calc test the next morning and panicked. It was a major thing because I didn't completely understand the math content and I spent the afternoon studying for it. I lost track of time, looked up, and I was 15 minutes past the deadline to submit my project. I freaked, tried to submit, was denied, and so emailed it to my professor with a message saying I wasn't able to submit it online and hoping he understood. He had told other students they could email him the project with corrections. In hindsight, I probably should have gone to talk to him the next day and explain the situation and hope he forgave me. But I simply hoped for the best. In the end, he didn't grade my project at all. After multiple emails, he finally responded the day before Christmas, long after final grades had been posted and claimed I never submitted the project. I had a flat 0 in as my grade so I asked why my other assignments weren't considered by their system. He said without 100s in everything else the project being a zero would have caused me to fail anyways so it didn't matter I'd still have an F. I asked him to reconsider and explained my situation, putting emphasis on my understanding of his classes content as well as my involvement in the comp sci club he oversees and the importance of my GPA to my scholarship so I can afford schooling. After looking, he said I never sent him the project in his email, not 15 minutes late like I claimed, not ever. And that late work wasnt acceptable as explained in the syllabus. (I give it to him, it was clear, but it was an honest mistake). I forwarded him the email that I had sent with my project so he could see it was done as well as a screenshot of my sent emails showing the date and timestamp and never received a response or updated grade after that. 

I'm at a loss. Due to the F, my GPA was set to a flat 3.0, putting my scholarship at risk if I don't bring it up. I can't afford college without it. My real question, with all of this context, is hopefully someone has any advice on what I should do to fix this? I have nothing against retaking the class. My biggest concern is getting the F off my transcript. I understand this may just have to be a hard lesson learned and strive for a 4.0 next semester so I don't lose my scholarship (it'll be checked at the end of the next semester), but if anyone else has any ideas please tell me. Is there anyone higher up I could go to for help sorting this out? Any other routes or suggestions? Any help at all would be appreciated!


Tl;dr I submitted a major project 15 minutes late by a stupid mistake. I fail automatically because of it, despite my grades in the class. Any way of fixing or negating the F? Or is this just gonna have to be a hard lesson learned?

Edit: I didn't realize retaking classes would replace the prior grade in the class so I'll just do that! Thanks for the help all.

My tuition would have been free this semester, if not for the freshman living on campus rule. The school I am attending is very small, with only a few thousand people, and there's not a lot of activities or stuff to do on campus. Despite this, it couldn't be that bad, could it?


 Believe me, I tried to keep a positive atittude and was really excited about starting college and trying to make friends. However, I have autism, and it's a crucial part of my identity and my lifestyle, so I got in contract with my school's disability office to talk about accomadations for this school year. Big mistake. They argued with me about living off campus or having a single room, and told me the school needs money, so freshman have to live on campus. I have a math learning disability as well, and am in the process of more comprehensive testing to really ""prove it"" , but it was established that I really struggle in the subject. The only accomadation I got was more test time, and so far, I haven't even gotten that in my class. I was told that my school loves diversity, but it seems like they view me and my disorder as a hassle more than anything. 



I also had to fight them for a parking pass to go to my doctor's appointments, and they're making me park in a lot 2 miles off campus because I can't park where the upperclassman are, which is bullshit and has made me late so many times, because I can't scheduele my doctors appointments at an earlier/later time. I refuse to miss class. So far I've gotten multiple parking tickets, most of them for not knowing where to park because I was never told where the lot was and its not on the map, and they told me it was my fault. I've been told to just deal with living in the dorms  by everyone with the exception of the school doctor and councelor, who have put me on anxiety medication and are making me go to therapy every week to try and cope with being here. I tried living in my dorm and couldn't handle it cause of people and noise, so they switched my room to a suite that I share with other people, who completely ignore me and make me feel even more unwelcome there. I just quit staying in my dorm and am staying off campus in the place I share with my friend for free, in exchange for driving her to the bus so we can go to class.


Also, since I had to pay for a meal plan, I eat in the cafeteria most of the time and I saw someone who had no meals left, and swiped my card for them. The lunch lady at the register pulled me aside and told me I was never to do that again, or they would confiscate my card. I nearly cried. This school makes me incredibly nervous and rigid, and I haven't made any friends here at all. All of the clubs I would be interested in meet late at night, like video game and anime clubs, so I never have the energy to go. I've tried to form a club for autistic people but can't get it approved, and have tried everyday to sit in the disability center in the library to meet more people I can relate to, but with no luck. I'm trying sports, but I'm very uncooridinated and bad at talking, so I tend to ramble or make comments every two seconds, and I don't fit it at all on my incredibly small, tight knit club team. I don't fit in at this school in general either. Most of the campus is vegan and I get lectured my strangers about how eating meat is animal abuse. Like really, what the fuck? People write things like ""Violence is the answer. Violence is a necessity"" all over the sidewalks and that is allowed and often encouraged. One girl was pitching a fit on the bus about misgendering animals and how that's important, and as a trans person, I wanted to deck her for saying something like that. But no one at my school is interested in anything but politics, that's all most of the clubs or events are about, and a lot of the dicussions in my classes are about political stuff 90% of the time. You have to adapt the exact views of everyone else or you will not be accepted, or get bad grades for it. (Multiple people have told me this)


I am almost failing my Calculus class, failing both the first quiz and test. I've been going to tutoring at school and I'm going to get help outside of school, studying constantly, and meeting with my professor, but because my algebra skills are so poor, I can barely catch up. Yet, my professor thinks I shouldn't go back to precalc because I took it last year. I've been in tears so many times because I feel like a failure, and despite making As in my other classes, I can't have that low grade affecting my GPA. I need to get out of here. My family and partner are telling me to just be strong and get through it, that I'm acting like a child and will adjust if I force myself to, but I've tried, and I can't stand it here.

Currently I am a first semester freshman at a Penn State branch campus studying IST (Information Science and Technology). Originally, I was planning on staying here all 4 years but after being here for a few weeks I'm not so certain. It's really hard to make friends here as it's a commuter school, and the IST major isn't exactly what I want. IST is the only major at this campus I'm at all interested in, but I'm more into more in depth stuff (computer science) but I couldn't place high enough in math for that. 

I recently found out that my school has a BS of Computational Data Science which sounds right up my alley and the entrance to major requirements are attainable, unlike pure CS. The problem here is cost. The major is only offered at the main campus, which would be quite a bit more expensive. Tuition here is around 13k for lower level classes, and 15k for upper level (my family and I are already struggling to pay even this, fucking religious private school tuition. Maxed out federal loans aren't enough). Main campus on the other hand, is around 20k, and that's not including room and other fees. Only way I'd be able to afford main campus would be lots of private loans, as my parents are refusing to take out parent loans and they really can't help at all with payment, due to the aforementioned private schools. I'm not going to hedge my bets on scholarships as they are a crapshoot but I'll sure as hell apply. 

TLDR: Do I stay at my current branch campus and do a major I'm not completely interested in, or do I swap majors to Data Science and go to main campus but have to take out substantial private loans for increased tuition and board?

Long story short, it's close to home (about five minutes away, in fact) and cheap. I can't afford to move out of the house, and I couldn't afford the tuition at a better university. 

Now, let me clarify, this is NOT at all a bad school. It has several nationally ranked programs and offers a lot of great things, depending on your major. The problem is, my degree program is not among them. I haven't heard anything particularly bad about it, but I haven't heard about it being exceptional either. I know there are a LOT of better schools I could attend for this program, but like I said, I just can't afford to leave home, even with financial aid and scholarships. 

I hate feeling like I have to limit my horizons due to money, but that is the reality of the situation. I am not willing to put myself $30,000+ dollars into debt for a degree that isn't exactly going to be making me six figures a year. I hear about some of my former high school classmates who are attending prestigious institutions, and it makes me feel very inferior. Even if I were to be accepted into one of those schools, I could never afford to go. 

So, that's basically my story. I'm trying to make peace with having to attend this university near my home. Again, it's not a bad school at all, and I have nothing against it, I'm just not particularly crazy about it. At the end of the day, is it really going to matter what school you go to? A degree is a degree, right? I've also heard that employers look at what things you were involved with besides academics. Is that true?

I'm planning to Major in Game Design and Minor in Creative Writing so I can become a Video Game Writer. I've made sure to pick classes that will help me reach this goal, including taking a Computer Science class this year to help me understand programming and coding.

To get through College, I've had to take 2 Direct Unsubsidized Loans. I've done the math and I'm already about $12,000+ in debt to the Government. I can't get any grants, because my parents make too much money to allow me to get free money for College. Unfortunately, we don't make enough money to afford me going to College without those Loans shaving some of the Tuition cost off.

With the current social situation in America, and my transition into adulthood, I've learned some troubling things for someone who just got into their 2nd year of college. That College Degrees are starting to be seen the same way as High School Diplomas (as in, unless you have the skills to back it up, your Bachelors/Masters doesn't mean shit), that it isn't worth going to College as they don't teach you anything useful, and in the end you'll just end up with no job and thousands of dollars in debt.
I want to help my parents out, but I need to take an hour train ride to school everyday, so I can't exactly just take any job under the sun unless it aligns with my schedule. As such, I've been trying to get a job on campus, and hope to take advantage of an offer I received last year to work at one of the fast food places there.

For my future, what I hope to do is become a Video Game Writer. If that doesn't work out, I hope to use my writing skills to become a Professional Writer.

So, before the school year starts, can you help me? Should I stay in College and graduate, or should I just focus on getting the skills and connections I need then drop out?

Any advice you can give will be greatly appreciated.

1) I'm set to graduate from a Cal State in 2 years. I can take a year off and dick around (working, working out, trying to find an internship) and then go to a UC of my choosing if I want. Is it worth it? The CSU is whatever, the UC is UCI.  

2) FAFSA -  

I will turn 24 late next year. FAFSA is based on the aid year in which you turn 24. So next year I will be eligible as an independent. Right?  

So my question is - As an independent, you are able to fill out some simplified form (or even zero EFC).  

About me:  
15K in the bank, was using for tuition.   
2K in some stocks from a family member.   
12K salary.    

As it stands, I used some FAFSA Calc and it kept taking into account my assets/savings/stocks so my EFC was high (grant low). With the Simplified form, it doesn't account for assets (which I'd like to use to get some medical treatment if the money is ever ""extra."").   
So, would I qualify for it the simplified form (asset-free)? The calc didn't give me that chance. I did file taxes in 2015, but I used turbo tax and I have no idea if I was elligible for a 1040A/EZ.  

Can someone help me figure this out? I might pull out of school and save up to afford the UC if I know I can get FAFSA. I sure as heck can't afford that without it.

My first few years of college left me with nothing more than tens (and tens) of thousands of dollars in debt. My parents don't have the ability to contribute much at all, and gone are the days of taking out loans to pay for my apartment. I'm transferring schools and living back at home with my parents while I finish school over the next 3 to 4 years. The nearest good school, the one I am transferring to, is roughly an hour commute each way. On top of this, I will be working roughly 20 hours a week to help offset some of the costs. Going into additional debt is going to happen, I just want to lessen that as much as possible. I do have a lot of credits coming in, so my average semester shouldn't be anymore than 12 hours. Still, even now, I'm getting a bit overwhelmed at spending 2 hours a day in a car and 4 to 5 hours at work with a (mostly) full time load. I'd love to find an apartment in the city closer to school, but that would require a significant increase in pay so that I could afford it completely on part-time hours.

Good news: said job, if I can continue to keep it the next several years, will reimburse up to $5,250 a year in tuition. I really don't want to give this up.

I am a 17 year old girl who's current plan is to go to college out of state. I am moving to the state where my college is and living with my mother who is already there (however I will not be receiving in state tuition, that's besides the point). The price is hefty (39,000 a year for tuition + room and board + personal expenses) and my both of my parents don't qualify for a Parent Plus Loan. The most money my family will get to pay for college is $5000. I've applied for scholarships and despite being a minority women going into the STEM field and being a first generation college student I did not win any of the scholarships I applied to lol. Anyways my point being is that paying for college is a problem for my family that we don't have a solution for.

I've already talked to my family about potentially not going to college this fall. It's not for sure since we're still looking at options as to how we're going to pay and potentially getting another family member to cosign the loan. Anyways I'm really considering taking a gap year and just working and volunteering. I would also like to do some tutoring too.

I want to make myself more productive and get more experiences. Also I'm young, very young for a graduating senior and freshmen in college. I'm not even an adult yet (and I won't be until this September) and I'm not sure I'm ready for the commitment of college. I've been struggling with depression and mostly very severe anxiety this past year also and I really want to do something with my life that will make me happy now that I'm done with high school and I have the freedom to do so.

However the cons of a gap year are what's preventing me from going through with this. While my plan is to work, volunteer, and be productive I know myself, and I know that I am lazy person. I can see myself falling behind and not keeping up with my own education. I am afraid that I will miss out on an education and this gap year will turn into 2 years and I just won't end up going to school. I was also thinking about taking a semester off or so after my first two years of college, which I read was beneficial to some. I really do not want to go to a CC because I really want the freshmen experience at a college and I don't want to transfer in as a junior anywhere. I feel like if I took a gap year it'd be alright because I would be the age of most of the kids coming in.

Anyways thanks for reading that and as you can see I'm really conflicted. This has been a subject of stress but I know things are going to work out for me. I would just like other opinions.

I'm also considering Franklin University. It is accredited by the HLC and I should be able to afford it, but I can't find if I will get a quality education. 

I looked into Georgia Tech but their Thread system seems a little wack and the descriptions of them are very vague. 

I've heard of the University of the People which is ""free"" and accredited plus it offers Computer Science. Because it is so new I'm afraid that the degree would have no worth to employers. 

Ultimately if SNHU is $40K total and not $40K per year that would be my dream school. However if a degree from UotP has any value to employers than I would prefer to go there first. The best scenario would be to go to UotP and get an entry level job afterwords to be able to afford SNHU.

I have no idea where to go, or if I should go to community college. My parents only make 100,000, and both UCSC and USC are drastically expensive for what we can afford. I was planning to go to ISC if I could get the tuitions into the higher 30's/early 40's. UC Santa Cruz is not with almost 40,000 imo, Bc it's a lower tier UC. I would go if it cost in the 20's. SDSU is a good deal for tuition, but that much room and board for a state school is insane imo? Idk if it is better to go to CC and transfer to a higher UC/reapply to USC with 2 years less tuition?

I hope to avoid the gigantic cost of room and board by finding people on the college reddit / facebook group to find accommodations near/cheap to th e school. Even though I would like to experience dorm life I believe I'm to cynical / introverted for that but I might have to.
Or join a fraternity that is based off my major/similar. 

I honestly don't know what to do exactly. I gotten to the point where I actually know the career field/job I want to aim for but not know how to go about getting started. I visited both the community colleges in my area and the state College. The community colleges seemed depressing and when I looked at their transfer and graduation rates I was turned off. 

I spoke with the lead engineer that i work with at times and he said the path I'm going would be the path he similarly took. He spoke about the area around the state University and how college was for him and his daughter. 
He stated making connections and friends would be easier as everyone would be new. Thus allowing it to be easier to find group / study partners and relationships compared to entering as a junior. 

I know going to cc is cheaper but I truly do want to experience the college life, build connections and relationships with people while having fun. 

I'm currently approaching 7 years out of school and truly concerned with the learning curve to get back in the groove of things.



When do you know how much $ FAFSA gives you before school?

When/if I need school loans which is best for me to obtain and in what amount do I do it for? Do I wait till FAFSA gives me what level of funding they give me or do I go based off the schools price?

How dumb is it to go to a state  school vs cc even though I been out of school for nearly 7 years?

So I'm currently a freshmen in my second semester going to the University Of Akron. I come from a town about an hour away called Youngstown. Because of this, I live on campus. I chose this school because it was a nice school and  had a pretty good program for my major. At the time we didn't realize how expensive it was, (We mis-read and thought the price of one year was all four years). My dad left when I was like 2 so I'v never had one, but my mother does well. She makes a good amount of money so we live comfortably. We are not wealthy by any means, we have enough though, but because of this, even know she is a single parent with  2 kids we barely get anything from the FAFSA which is a bit ridiculous IMO. Anyways, she is constantly saying things like it's too expensive and stuff to like everybody and even to me, then re illiterates saying but, go there, I'm not going to make you come back ( and go to the local college, Youngstown State University) if you really don't want too, but it just sucks knowing how expensive school is and stuff. So I have a few questions.





First off, I don't mind going back to YSU at all, it's not that big of a deal to me, so my questions are.




If I go back, how hard is the transfer process, like how difficult would it be switching ( for the fall semester).






If I go back home that cuts the cost by a lot, as I'll be living at home, but in the end, how much student debt is the difference between them? Akron with room &amp; board: (	$11,064 ) + Tution (10,260), versus YSU Tuition ($8,087.28). This stuff confuses me a little, so I'm not sure exactly how it works, but I believe ATM I pay about 8k a semester. So how much difference of debt would this end up being?




How are would it be to get back on track? I'm assuming they don't offer the exact same classes, so are all the classes I'v already taken useless? 




And lastly; What is the difference between schools for future employers? I'v heard state schools are better, but I'm fairly certain Akron is a better school, would the difference between these schools be a big factor? Like would a possible employer look the other way because I attended YSU?

Upon graduating high school, I had to make the decision of either saving money or enjoying college. I ended up deciding to save money.

I am currently at my local community college for free for two years. I'm doing very well and I'm very bored.

I recently received an email from my counselor. I'm eligible for this six week summer program at this private school. They would basically pay me to lodge there and take two classes for six weeks. There is also the possibility of getting a full scholarship to this place upon completion of the program. The tuition plus bored is about $62,000 per year.

But this place is out in the middle of no where. I want to go to a city and have a lot to see and do. This isn't my dream college. So far I don't see anything great about it.

If I went to my dream college I would end up paying about 50,000 for two years including room and board. (Obviously I can't afford this so loans.)

I'm in my first year at community college majoring in English and I have a 4.0 GPA so far, but I hope that when I transfer I really want to double major in mathematics, and I've tried taking math classes now just to prep. I actually didn't pay attention in math in high school but now that I've been doing it I realize it's something I really love lol. I know it's really early to tell since I plan to transfer as a sophomore but I was wondering if I could have help just ... generally laying out a goal for transfer. I went to a pretty good public high school, but my grades were pretty bad freshman and sophomore year because something bad happened freshman year that sort of wrecked me emotionally; by junior year I had learned to cope and I graduated with 3.9 weighted GPA. I didn't apply to a lot of schools because to be frank, I really didn't know where to start - my parents weren't born in the US and didn't really complete a lot of college, only as much as they could while they were also supporting their families, and so they can't really give me advice. My college counselors would try to help, but they also had to deal with a lot of other kids, so I didn't feel like I got the help I needed, so I just ended up applying to UCLA, UCSD, UCSB, NYU, and Sarah Lawrence. I got into all of them except UCLA, but even with aid I just couldn't afford the tuition, and I ended up going to community college.

I feel really stupid because I really don't know where to start researching colleges to transfer to at all. I can't really ask my family because of what I said already, and besides them, I don't know who else to really turn to. I've been considering applying to privates but I feel sort of hopeless, since everyone says there's no real point if you're coming from community college, and if anyone could offer input on that, it'd be really cool of you. Financial aid-wise, I've been working a bunch and I've saved up enough to at least make a dent in my tuition, but I'd still need financial aid, since I can't really rely on my family too much. I'm a little intimidated by loans but I'm willing to go for them this time. If anyone could offer suggestions on what to do from here too, I'm all ears.

Sorry if this is wordy ... because I'm still a freshman in college, I tried to include background about high school to give more info, but idk if it's even that relevant. Thanks so much!

154,RockBou,1480931918,/r/college/comments/5gl56t/opinions_on_college_attendance_policies/,"I'm a little bit biased on this because I'm personally against using attendance as part of a student's grade. I'll lay it out, based on my thoughts, like this. 

**Rewards &amp; Penalizes You Regardless of Ability**
This is probably the most frustrating point for me. When classes weigh attendance policies like this, it's not truly representative of performance in the class. I've seen people who are generally terrible at the assignments pass classes because of attendance alone, while others who perform excellently are penalized for not being present. For example in one of my classes my grades are:

*Assignment 1: 100
Assignment 2: 95
Assignment 3: 100
Assignment 4: 95*

Based off this alone, my average would be a 97.5 but when you factor in my attendance grade (58) which drops quite a bit for every missed class my average is an 89.6 barely rounding to an A. The class itself is a 4000 level class &amp; requires effort (for instance one of my 100 grades was a 21 page paper I wrote) but the attendance policy either hurts or help you by eschewing your actual success in the class. Another one of my classes not only has a daily attendance grade, but also takes a point off your total average for every day you miss past 2 days. 

**We're Already Paying for the Classes**
Especially in America, where tuition is ridiculous, it's very frustrating to have to shell out huge amounts of money for the opportunity to attend a class only to be penalized when you don't. In one sense, it's already wasted money on our part, don't add salt to the wound. College is expensive, and when we miss days not only are we reminded that's money wasted, but we're missing out on the material being covered that day. Also penalizing our grade as well is just going overboard.

**Students with More Responsibility Suffer More**
Yes it's a student's responsibility to attend class, but it's easier to fulfill that obligation when you're not juggling other responsibilities. In my case, the number one reason I'm not attending class is because of work. I typically work nights since I have school during the day. Some days I'm more exhausted than others, getting off of work at 6am and then having class at 9 am is an extremely difficult task to pull of sometimes. This is especially frustrating because I work to make sure I can afford to go to college and in general survive day to day. I've also seen people miss class because of: Parents having to take care of a sick child, People helping out their families or attending familial events, work scheduling errors, court cases, travel complications &amp; more. The effects of these events on a student's grade (via participation) is generally up to the goodwill &amp; kindness of the professor. 

**Sick? Suck It Up**
Another reason I've missed days is due to an occasional sickness. The problem is, per regulation, the student health center is not an accepted medical excuse. Going to the doctor requires even more time, travel and money. This means that for myself and many others you either have to go to class sick, shell out money for a doctor, hope your professor takes pity on you or take the hit on your attendance grade. 

**Why do you want unmotivated students anyway?**
For some students attendance policies keep the lazy students who would otherwise never attend in class. I've heard this as a ""for"" attendance argument, but the question it raises to me is, why do you want those students there? These are the students I typically see idling their time away, talking in class, complaining or hassling the professors and distracting other students. In classes without attendance policies, I tend to see more motivated and interested students arrive to class. I also find that we cover &amp; discuss more in those classes compared to others.

**It's Favors the Wealthier**
Students who can afford the more expensive apartments or dorms near/on campus benefit from being able to walk to their classes and arrive quickly. Students who don't need to work on the side have more free time &amp; sleeping hours available. Students who can afford good vehicles or repairs on their vehicles can drive to campus on time. Students who can afford a doctor's visit get a valid excuse. Students who depend on the bus or walking for transportation are at the mercy of the weather &amp; the bus schedules. In one of the odder cases of income favoring, one of my friends who lives in the shadier area of town had his vehicle broken into and tires slashed. He ended up missing two classes because of that and took a hit accordingly. These things largely can't be helped, but attendance policies sometimes seem like they're penalizing people for things that can't be helped.

**Arguments For Attendance- Naturally since I want to hear your opinions I'll also list some reasons I've been told that attendance policies are good, minus my counterarguments.**

**It's an Easy Grade Booster**
Most common for argument I've seen with students. If you attend class it's fairly easy to pass the class, even if it's difficult. Attendance grades can also give you the boost needed to go from a B to an A.

**It Teaches Responsibility**
College prepares you for life &amp; careers, you can't just not show up for work. Sometimes you have to balance multiple responsibilities in life &amp; other areas will take a hit. 

**Professor's Don't Want to Teach an Empty Class**
Professor's want their students to do well and be present, largely. In classes with attendance policies they get to work towards both of these things with larger concentrations of students. It also makes sure that professor's aren't wasting their time. 

**It Rewards People Who Make an Effort**
Even if you're not particularly good at the subject, it evens up the playing field for at least rewarding the students who make the effort and attend every class. For the lazy students it does penalize them so they're not portrayed as equal to the ones who arrive on time every day.

TLDR: I'm personally against College Attendance Policies for the initial reasons listed. I recognize that there are pros to the policies as well however (also listed). What I want to know is your thoughts on this for or against and arguments why. Please try to list actual concrete reasons rather than things like ""It's Because the Professor's are Jerks."" or ""I want to sleep all day""",college,Opinions on College Attendance Policies?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5gl56t/opinions_on_college_attendance_policies/,1480949918.0

After returning to California after 4 years in the Army I looked forward to pursuing a higher education at the University of California, San Diego(UCSD) with my newly awarded GI Bill. Hoping to declare Aerospace Engineering I soon found that the program was impacted and therefore highly impacted. Nevertheless, I chose another interest of mine Astrophysics; however, without any experience with physics and jaded by the implications of ""weed-out"" courses I changed my major to Mathematics in hopes of becoming a high school teacher. 

Unfortunately I was imprisoned over the summer due to my alcoholism and a well-placed checkpoint. Afterwards my grades continued to drop to the point of my academic disqualification, and the forcing of a change of major to Literature. What followed was my mother's relapse into meth, her hospitalization, and my depression. 

Nowadays, in the mist of the readmission process, I navigate the community college realm; requirements being a full year as a full-time student with a B average. At the beginning of the semester I was working overnight, tossing boxes down aisles at Target, the only place that would hire me, from 11pm-7am; sometimes going 24-72 hours without sleep. Ever since my academic disqualification I took a pay cut, going from $2900 to $1400 a month. As for my health, I was without my medication and therapy, lacked sleep from the duality between working days and nights, and lost 20 pounds due to my stress and inability to afford food. 

Liberating myself from the overnight stressor I'm now pursuing, unsuccessfully, any job that compliments a college schedule. Having learnt the clockwork like job at Target after a week, I saw that there was little room for advancement, and no hope of professional development. Does one toil perpetually in order to pay their bills or pursue a college education in hopes of a better career? Quitting my job without any savings has left me in the grips of my debtors. 

This has been a big rant and reflection so I must conclude with the realization of my lower class state and rising resiliency to a college education. One feels stuck in this lower tier of labor; working a minimum wage job with no future, unable to find affordable housing, and pay for tuition and textbooks. 

I really want to give up....i don't know who I really am....I'm not really good at anything since every hackneyed, compulsive endeavor has failed. I have an idea of what I want to do, but UCSD has barred me from Engineering and Mathematics. Having completed most of my general education, 89 quarter units(equal to 60 semester units), I am left with no applicable knowledge and no certification. These past 3 years I have been blowing like chafe in the wind, landing where ever the breeze takes it, be it the harvester's bucket or, in my case amongst the weeds and thorns. Ultimately I'm without direction and without cause, this tragic life keeps spiraling evermore into the abyss as I try to escape its grasp. Please....I need direction....I need a job....I feel like if I continue with the readmission process as a Literature major, I'll never get a job. It's not like I'm capable of moving to another city or state to start anew.....I just don't know what to do anymore...I find myself constantly procrastinating and distracting myself in a self saboteur manner....my grades are going great at the CC, but truthfully, the courses are a joke since one doesn't have to actually read any of the assignments in order to pass.....is college really worth it if I can't apply in this modern world? Buying into the advanced education dogma of the promise to the American Dream has left me unskilled and unsatisfied.

Normally I wouldn't worry too much, as I feel that everyone else likely did poorly as well, but the issue is that this professor is NOT generous with curving (or so I've been told). So now, I've been worried that this will seriously sink my grade and make just passing this class that much more infeasible. I've done well on the projects and homework up to this point, but if the final is anything like the midterm, I'm seriously fearing I'm going to fail this one class that I need the credits for to graduate. 

Have any of you guys went through a similar experience? Failing is pretty much not an option for me here--I can't afford another full quarter of tuition just to take a single class. On top of that, I won't have any guaranteed housing at that point either. I'd be put in a really terrible situation if I can't get through this course. I know I put all of my eggs in one basket by assuming I would just make it through this quarter but I've worked just as hard, if not harder, as all of my previous quarters to do well. In my other 3 classes, I'm not even worried about passing at this point. It's literally one class that I feel could entirely postpone my graduation. 

What are my options? When should I start talking to my professor and discussing my concerns about the course? We haven't gotten our midterms back and I don't want to jump the gun in the event he does curve. I've done well throughout college and I'll be absolutely devastated if this one class stops me from graduating in December.

162,ThePaulitician,1472744092,/r/college/comments/50ns4b/please_help_transfer_process/,"I am strongly inclined to transfer immediately after this semester to a school back home.

I am a native of South Florida and I attended the summer semester at Univ. Of Central Florida (UCF) and am currently attending the fall semester here as well.

My situation for going to college was largely based off the fact that I had a lot of AP Credits. I took 15 AP Classes in high school and passed all of the exams except for 2.

I originally intended on majoring in engineering but switched to Radio/TV on the first day of summer classes. I had taken AP Chemistry, Physics 2 and Physics C: Mechanics in High school and only passed the Physics C: Mec exam. I had decided that at the end of the day, the teachers can only teach so much in an engineering/science setting. Every one of these AP Sciences I took always had a first-year teacher or a teacher who was a rookie to the class. Now, they were smart and knew the material, they just struggled teaching it as it was very difficult material. And it would ultimately be up to me to teach myself and try to get help. I tried to get help, but then realized it was *just not possible* for a student like myself. I really had never seen such challenging, unfamiliar material to the point where I didn't even know where to begin some problems. So I decided to switch to Radio/TV because I am good at public speaking and already have some advantages with YouTube and connections to current students that are also communication majors (these students are not students at UCF though).

The summer was a questionable experience, but it was easy and I got 2 A's. The fall, however, is just as easy but I can't seem to get this topic of transferring off my mind. I had to change some classes for fall and was actually **running out of classes** due to the amount of AP Credits I came in with. Therefore, **the only way I will even be able to attend UCF in the Spring 2017 semester will be to declare a minor.** This is because the Radio/TV program here is application-based and requires a certain amount of credit hours obtained *at UCF.* So I would only be taking classes in Spring for that requirement.

I really just don't see much of a future for myself here. UCF is a great school for a lot of people, but **I just don't see a future for myself down the road here.** The University is in I guess what most people would call an expansion stage; a large portion of this campus is under construction and the school has recently developed connections to funding and internships almost exclusively for STEM Majors and are now looking at opportunities for other majors. Our President is getting very old (no offense to him, but he took the position of President in 1992!) and he's been a good leader that I feel he will be hard to replace. He wasn't even able to attend most of the Opening Ceremony here for freshmen as he left the stage early barely under his own control and he studdered with the teleprompters. This school also has a lot of resources and tuition paying for things I do not even use. There is a *huge* drug and alcohol prevention program, a Pride (LGBQT) place to name a few things and I just have no use for that. I'm sorry but this is college and I have no pity for people who are alcoholics or drug addicts for the most part and the money in my tuition that goes to that is just not reasonable to me and I'm not offensive to LBGQT people so yeah... On top of this, the Radio/TV program is seeming unstable to me. The first day of COM class, my professor showed up late with a very petty excuse and they subbed in another teacher who didn't know what she was doing for the most part.

All this worries me about a future here.

I'm strongly intent on transferring back home to FIU in Miami. Their communication program is application-based too but has less requirement including the credit hours. I also would find a job with the Miami Marlins and Florida Panthers to try to get a background in sports (the portion of radio/TV I want to go into) and it will also give me connections and the opportunity to work for a team if I can't find a job with my degree. Plus, it will be cheaper and I won't be paying for these ridiculously priced meal plans and stuff. Living away from home is expensive and I didn't realize how different it can be until now. I'm not homesick as I've done very well here as you can tell, I just think I have better opportunities and a path down the road back home at FIU instead of here at UCF. My brother graduated 3 years ago and still has not found a job with his degree and I just would hate to see the same thing happen to me.

The problem with this is going to be convincing my parents about it. They are very ""helicopter-ing"" as the UCF First Year Advisors put it. I originally wanted to go to a community college for one semester  (to avoid this situation) but my parents insisted I go to a normal school. My parents have this sort of pride I guess with me going away to school, but in all hoenesty, they won't be able to afford this place after the first year and they refuse to admit that.

I have until November 1st to submit a transfer application to FIU and I am confident at this point that I would want to submit one. I got a partial scholarship here to UCF and I have no doubt that I'd be accepted at FIU at this point.

Help!

How should I approach my parents about this?

For transfer students, can you tell me what influenced your decision to transfer?

I also am very not looking forward to making the trip to the advising office to talk about this. I'm not looking forward to the ""Are you sure? UCF is a great place to be!"" speech.

163,hebrewhammer24,1471876127,/r/college/comments/4z0s00/scholarships_transferring_and_paying_out_of_state/,"Hey guys,

So I am thinking about transferring to a large university, like the University of Florida, Florida State, UNC, Georgia, etc,. The reason being, my major is almost useless if I don't go to a major division one university with the best possible internships, because of how competitive it gets. After this full year, my hope is to have between a 3.5 and 4.0 GPA at my current school. If I go to a large D1 school like this, the cost of attendance with out-of-state tuition can get near $40,000, if not more! My parents have recently been making way more money than they ever have ($150k+), and I will get little to no money at all from FAFSA. I personally can't afford this, and my parents recent income has come after a very hard couple of years when I was in junior high school, where they were both bouncing between unemployment and temp jobs because of the recession. My parents don't have the money to help me out yet, and I don't have the money either. My dad has an associates degree and my mom dropped out of UCLA in her third year to move to New York with my dad (dumb decision..), and my grandparents were highly educated (BS from UCLA and MBA from USC) so I won't get any ""first generation college student"" grants/scholarships. With my GPA, how much do you think I can expect to get through scholarships? I really would love to start my Sophomore year at a school like the ones I stated, but I'm not sure I can afford it, and I don't want to waste my degree at a SUNY (not that these aren't great schools, I just don't think I'll get anywhere with a Sports Management degree in central/western New York).

164,atraxicorico,1468735870,/r/college/comments/4t8hmf/dealing_with_quarter_to_semester_prerequisites/,"Okay so no matter where I go, i seem to get screwed over by classes from my original university. Also I'm the first person in my family to go to college so its hard for me to get advice about it at home. 

I started college in Fall of 2014 at a University of California as undeclared. I knew I wanted to be an engineering major but because of a lot of overcrowding and other UC system issues, I wasn't able to enroll in pre-req classes (i.e. math, physics, and chem for engineering, pretty standard lower div science major classes). I thought about dropping out after my first year and attending a CC but was strongly advised against and that transferring would not be an issue. I finished my second year with a quarter each of Calc and Gen. Chem. (After spending countless numbers hours and brain power trying to crash classes, email professors, complain to departments etc. I did, however, finish my GEs) 

Now I've finally gotten accepted to the engineering school of my dreams. Problem: I can't afford to spend $50,000 a year in tuition for 4 years as I will basically be starting the program as a ""freshman""(yes I'll get a lot of financial aid, but I'm pretty sure I'd only be able to get 2 more years of government aid/FAFSA and my new university is private/out of state). So I deferred my enrollment (first for a quarter, can extend later) in the hopes of making up some credits at a local CC. The problem I've had with this is that I need 2 semesters or 3 quarters of each class and my 1 quarter will not prepare me for semester 2 of math/chem (found this out last summer when trying to enroll in Calc II). 

Next problem, all of my local community colleges (SF Bay Area) are semester system so I would have to repeat the only useful credits I've earned in math/physics and I *really* do not have the extra time/money to spend on repeating classes that I did well in because I need to keep a part time job on the side to pay for things like health insurance. The only quarter system CC is De Anza College which is 2.5 hours away from my house (San Francisco) by public transit and I don't have a car or a license. However, I could use my savings to get a used car and commute would be 45 mins. It would also only take me 2 quarters at De Anza. My mom, however doesn't want me driving to school every day and doesn't understand that this is the only option I have other than repeating coursework. 

I'm not really sure what to do. I guess my questions are is it worth repeating 2 semesters of coursework when I could be making more progress in 2 more quarters of classes? Is there a workaround with CCs for getting them to accept quarter credits? Are you only eligible for FAFSA aid for 4 years of undergrad?

I graduated in 2015 with a BA in anthropology (focused on biological) with a GPA of 2.4.  I want to continue my education but cannot get anywhere because of my low GPA, reaching out in hope that someone can help guide me to the next step.

Some of you may get a laugh out of this, but my dream/goal is to go to medical school.  I've been told many times to give it up, my degree is useless, and so forth.  And I do admit, an Anthropology degree is pretty difficult to get around.  To make it relevant, I focused more towards the Biological side of the discipline, working with biostatistics and genetics data.  I took courses in public health, medical anthropology, biological physics, things of that nature that are offered at my university.  Academic performance and competitiveness, is where I fail at and absolutely where I should have been more careful about.  I was under a very difficult circumstance, which of course, is what many students with poor academic performance would also say to justify their GPA.  I've reflected about this over and over again and take full blame for everything, I simply want to move on and learn from these mistakes find a way to fix it.  I tell you a little bit about my background and circumstances, not as an exhaustive list of excuses, but as a lesson that hopefully someone can help me out and evaluate the options I now have.

The one positive thing about all of this, I graduated with no debt and didn't take out any loans.  I came from SE Asia and was born in a small village with no running water, no electricity, we lived a very primitive and simple life.  How I get to the U.S is a long story, and I will spare you the details.  I came here when I was relatively young, but took a while to adjust and learn all the new technology, the first time I used a computer was when I started my first day of class in the U.S, it was in 5th grade.  I was the first in my family to attend and graduate High school, and then college.  As you can imagine, everything was a ""learn-on-the-job"" type of situation.   Applying to college was a magical situation for me, everything was online, submit a few essays...and that's it.  Who submitted my documents, test results? How'd they know it's me? Everything was just done automatically, it was a little shocking to me.  But somehow, I managed it, I got in a decent state college (UF).  I was a little behind the curve with technology, but everything else, I managed.  But that's when everything just went sour.

Being away from home was, of course, a little difficult.  But I managed the first two semester fine.  My second year and forth is when everything just went bad.  I started overthinking about what I wanted to do, the end goal, that I over load on volunteering, extracurricular, silly resume booster things that are now meaningless because of my incompetent GPA.  My grade dropped, I became ineligible for the grants and aid I was receiving and ended up having to take a job to cover for these expenses.  I was literally illiterate when it comes to money and financial aid at that point.  My parents advised me against loans (it's a big no-no and highly stigmatized for them), and of course I listened.  I made absolutely no use of the resources available, had no idea where to look for help or even ask questions, I felt like completely lost and ashamed in front of my peers with my situation.  Looking back, I was a fool and hated myself for it.  I worked overnight shifts and weekends at the hospital, scheduled my classes early in the morning so i can go straight to class after work, getting paid 10/hr, you can imagine how it was to pay for 3-4k tuition a semester.  My schedule would often look like this: 10pm-8am (work) 8:30-noon (class).  It was exhausting, I studied on the job, on the bus, between classes, during lunch, on the toilet, literally anywhere, just to get by with a 2.4.  Pretty sad, I know.

I graduated and working now at a dead-end job that pays 9/hr, even worse than when I had no degree.  Doing everything I can, volunteering, researching, everything and anything to hope for a chance that some school would look pass my horrid GPA and a somewhat irrelevant degree.  My GPA is too low to even apply to any postbacc, masters, certificates.  Some have suggested that I do some DIY classes at a nearby school to raise my GPA, but that would require me to be a non-degree seeking student, which would rule out financial aid, I can't afford tuition with my job and even if i could, that would be making the same mistake all over again.

What should I do reddit?  I've consider cutting my losses, apply for a second degree and get a STEM major? I'm really at a dead-end this time around and it's becoming quite a burden/depressing thing to handle.  Reaching out for some words of wisdom and advice.  Thank you, reddit.

That's not going to change so at the moment I have pretty much my major credits left over.

As far as I can tell that is 20 classes left so I could be out by Spring 2018 or Fall 2018 if I take 4 classes a semester. I am doing accounting and I may or may not have passed intermediate accounting 1, I will know later this week. If I didn't then I will have to retake it and I will have 21 classes left instead. I was planning on taking a summer class, the first Finance class, but it costs about $1000~. I can pay it but I will have less money for the upcoming fall semester so I might just barely get by paying for that semester. I plan on taking loans out for the Spring 2017 semester since that's when I wont have enough to cover the costs and I was hoping to avoid loans until then.

My dilemma is, if I don't pass intermediate, I will have another class to worry about anyways so I wont get too far ahead, and I don't want to spend that much if I will barely get by or not have enough to pay off tuition for the fall. Also, since it is a Finance class and I have never taken a Finance class, I feel like I could do bad or possibly not pass. My intermediate accounting class was really difficult so that is what I am expecting since it is a summer class as well. I am also working a part time job so that doesn't help.

Next summer I was planning on taking an internship class to gain experience and take care of that required class but it may be off set by taking this class if I can't afford it. So should I risk it and take the class, not knowing anything about Finance and spend money that I could use for next semester, or just wait it out?

Now as I registered for Fall quarter it's still massively impacted and I can not financially afford to just spend a quarter collecting credits I don't need at all to improve my registration priority. 

So I'm stuck. I have no idea what to do. I didn't do well enough GPA wise to transfer into UW, and there's no point in transferring elsewhere in WA (especially if I'm not preserving my scholarship).

With that in mind, I'm thinking about taking a year and working, then reapplying to other colleges --  as rigorous as possible, public, and preferably on the east coast with either really good scholarship and aid or really low tuition. 

From my own searching, the best thing I've found is SUNY at Binghamton, but I'm not sure I can even afford that. My credentials are good enough that I can just go to public school in my home state for free if there are no other affordable options, but I'm not sure I could stand being stuck in Idaho for another four years.

It's enough to be comfortable, but I couldn't afford a sketch pad she was asking for me to have specifically. I really didn't see anyone else in the class with a sketch pad as big as the one she wanted me to get, so I explained to her I didn't have the money, but I could make it work by taping paper together from my smaller sketch pads that I already own. She immediately told me this wasn't good enough. I can't remember the dialogue word-for-word, but she ended up asking me about my government financial assistance, which by the way is the only way I'm even at college as well as scholarships and pell grants (I'm completely loan free thanks to them.), she said that they should just pay for it. I told her that's not how it worked and I had a different contract with them that only provides textbooks, tuition and fees. She told me that it wasn't true, that they'll give me the money if I just asked. 

Then before I could even explain anything to her, she asked me how I could afford to go to California for spring break but not afford school... All of this happened in front of my entire class.

My mom always files for a tax extension, and so she always files right up to the October 15th deadline. In previous years, she's estimated her income on the FAFSA and CSS Profile, and that has satisfied my school's financial aid office. This year, there's a new policy. My mom has to submit her 2015 taxes before I get any aid. The fall semester starts on September 8th, the tuition bill is due on October 8th, and if you miss that deadline, you get forcibly withdrawn from the school. So if my mom files her taxes on October 15th and it gets processed by November 15th, I will have to withdraw.

I have talked to the financial aid office. They said that no matter when my mom submits her tax return, I will get the same aid I've gotten every other year. Basically they said I would have to pay $20K+ up front and then I'd get that refunded when my mom's tax return goes through. I cannot afford that (I can't qualify for a loan of that magnitude, and I don't have a cosigner) which is why I'd have to withdraw.

My question: Because of this situation, I'll be taking classes from September 8th to October 8th and then withdraw from the school. Can I re-enroll in those same classes in mid-November when her tax return is processed? Taking 5-ish weeks off will murder my grades, but at least I won't be a drop out. Taking the semester off isn't really an option because it's hard to re-enroll when you've been out of school for over 6 months.

174,Sanux,1456910983,/r/college/comments/48lfxa/need_help_nonaccredited_mechanical_engineering/,"I'm currently enrolled at Florida Polytechnic University. This is the State's 12th public university (which was designed to offer STEM only majors). However, this is only the University's 2nd year open... This means we don't have regional accreditation or ABET accreditation.

While my school has been actively pursuing regional accreditation and achieving all the goals set for accreditation. I just received an email from our President informing us that instead of receiving our regional accreditation this summer (2016), it will be next summer (2017) due to the regional board requiring a school to be a candidate for a year, something unaware to our school and the BOG.

Now, ABET requires an institute to be regionally accredited before applying. It also takes ~18 months for ABET to approve accreditation for a new program.

So, here's the problem... I'm currently set to graduate the spring of 2017. This means I'll graduate before we receive regional accreditation. While the regional accreditation will be retroactive for me, ABET won't be... Which means I'll be graduating with a mechanical engineering degree without ABET accreditation if I stick to the school.

I pretty much have 3 options available to me right now: 1. Transfer to UCF and finish school there. However, I'd have to take 60 credits worth of classes and lose scholarship currently at Florida Poly. This means I won't end graduating until 2018 and might end up taking out a student loan if I can't afford the tuition. 2. I can double major at Florida Poly, which would push my graduation date back to 2018 as well, but I'd still be risking issues with accreditation if one would arise. 3. Stick with it and graduate debt-free and in the spring of 2017 without an ABET accredited engineering degree.

176,Mikeb1123,1456364915,/r/college/comments/47gjsm/should_i_drop_this_class_also_other_concerns/,"Hi. I am a Corporate Financial Management major. 

As for the first matter of business, I need help deciding to drop this class. Allow me to explain. 

Since my GPA was low, I was working hard to bring it up with the semesters I have left. I switched majors, suffered from financial hardship, worked, and had other troubles going on (won't go in to details, but I made a mistake, and I am learning from it.) Anyway, after working to pay for my tuition and other things going on, I crashed, burned and almost dropped out. Long story short, I decided I wanted to succeed, and really started trying to get good grades. Currently, I have a 2.8 accumulative, and I was coming off my strongest semester yet, with a 3.1 on the semester. 

I started off this semester strong, and something happened. I didn't come out of vacation mode, lost motivation, and currently I am scheduled to talk to a counselor about my problems, and hopefully get back on track. Luckily, my first round of tests, I only failed one, calc. 

Now keep in mind, I am taking 15 credit hours this semester, including a humanities class that has 4 credit hours, and an accounting class which is challenging. I failed my fist calc test, and I am having trouble keeping up. I could drop it, receive a WD on my trascript, (Never withdrew from a class.) and focus on my other classes, which are kinda difficult, especially accounting, and get good grades in those classes, as opposed to having 3 C's, because I poured all this time in to calc, because I stared off in the hole, only to get a C. I am trying to bring my GPA up, not be average, and in that class, I am not doing that well, and I am doing about average in my accounting class. It will put me behind slightly, but regardless, I have about 2.5 years until I graduate. I am also going through this funk, and I just think maybe I am taking too many classes. Any suggestions? I have not passed the WD date, I have about 2 weeks to decide. 

On the other matter, I feel this immense pressure. I want to obviously graduate, and get a good job, but advisers and such make me feel like it's nearly impossible by my standards. According to them, I need to have at least a 3.0 GPA, I need to also join organizations, or else I might just be sitting on my ass with a degree because everyone looks at my low GPA and passes. No one cares that I am working my way through college, paying out of pocket to go, just that I need to achieve these accolades, or it's always going to be an uphill battle. This makes me feel like I am almost wasting my time. What's the point of working hard, at this point, my GPA may never be above 3.0. That's another reason I might drop this class, I can't afford to get a C.

191,HalcyonEndures,1435889963,/r/college/comments/3bxzxy/apparently_i_have_on_semester_of_financial_aid/,"Long story short, I started community college in 2011 after graduating high school. I ended up switching majors twice and having to take a few semesters off due to financial problems, and to this day am still working on my degree. I'm getting ready to start my fourth, and hopefully final, year before moving on to a 4-year university.

I received an email from the college a few weeks ago stating that since I hadn't completed my degree yet, I would likely have one more semester of financial aid eligibility left.

This worries me quite a bit, as I can't afford to go to school without grant or loan money. I'm currently paying off a lot of debt I owe and wouldn't be able to afford going to school out of pocket for at least another two years.

I considered applying for scholarships to help, as my tuition is pretty low and a few smaller scholarships would definitely help. Unfortunately, as a result of getting burnt out on my current major and practically giving up last year, my GPA is in the toilet and barely hanging on above a 2.0. Most scholarships are GPA-dependent, or it least it seemed like they were when I was in high school, so I'm worried I won't be eligible for any. I'm planning on getting my grades back up this coming semester, but I'm worried that by the time I get them back up, it'll be too late to apply for any scholarships.

Do I have any kind of options here? What happens if I finish my Associate's but want to continue on at a different school for a Bachelor's?

So I got lucky in beginning my University career at a school without crazy tuition rates ($6100/year in and out of state). 

However, I've recently been thinking about switching majors from F&amp;NMT (see flair) to Public Health Nutrition (or Public Health with a Minor in Nutrition or Concentration in Nutrition). However, that is not a major that my school has, and I am desperately trying to stay away from crazy science classes that I fail miserably in (Bio, Chem 1&amp;2, Micro, Orgo, A&amp;P). Which leads mostly to a B.A. in Public Health. I'm fine with that. 

What I'm not fine with is the price tag, since all the schools with programs that meet that are out-of-state for me which equals like $35k+ tuition. 

So I have to ask... how do you all do it? Like... seriously? 

I can't take out private loans without a qualified cosigner (that I don't have), my mom doesn't qualify for PLUS, my Dad refuses to have anything to do with loans/borrowing money. 

So how do you do it?

Their tuition doesn't change based on residency and their dorms aren't very expensive. I am looking at my options for after CC and I can't afford anything. My only sources of money would be my small savings (a few thousand), $5,500 federal loans each year (my parents make too much to get anything), and any scholarships.

I see a lot of posts of people asking where they should go to school, with a giant list of places they've applied to and I wish that I was able to do that, but I can't afford anything.

196,[deleted],1418753154,/r/college/comments/2phmnj/think_i_made_a_huge_mistake/,"So I moved to Chicago from a small town in Maine to go to college for audio engineering. This, at present, is what I regard as my fundamental mistake. 

For the first year they required me to live on campus, which I did. I did great in my classes, had ample free time for studying/extra work, etc. 

But I'm paying myself. The loans for school are all going to be on me when I graduate. Because of this I figured I should move into an apartment and work to pay rent so I didn't have to pay off the on campus housing along with tuition after graduation. Since I already had a part time job near campus (downtown), I just upped myself to a 50 hour work week and signed a lease. I thought I could handle it.

This was at the start of this past semester. I quickly toned my work weeks down to 40 hours because I overestimated how much I could work and still do well in school.

Fast forward to today. Finals week was last week. I did fine enough in all my classes, I suppose, except for one, which happens to be the only class I took that was really difficult at all. The rest were basically review, but I straight up failed this one. I just didn't have the free time or mental energy to put in the required effort. 

Prof understands my position and is trying to help me retake things but as I'm leaving tomorrow for Christmas and my grade is below 50% (I've never gotten anything lower than an 80%) unless I do perfectly on everything I redo (which I won't), I won't pass.

Sorry this is long winded. TL;DR: my chosen field is so oversaturated with aspiring audio engineers that the amount of effort I have time to put in on top of working to pay rent isn't nearly enough to get me a job ever, but since my loans are deferred until I leave school I can't drop out without being slammed with payments on top of rent I can barely afford as it is.

Advice?

EDIT: getting tons of flak for going home for Christmas and people seem to think I'm giving up on making up the grade in the class to do so. I'm not. I'm making up exactly the same work I would be from Chicago, just won't be working 40 hours on top of it so I'll actually have time to do it.

201,[deleted],1353624609,/r/college/comments/13n2e1/the_college_bubble_the_combination_of_economic/,"Since we were young, we've been told that with hard work and determination in high school we would one day make it to college. Once there, if we succeeded with graduating, we'd get a degree which would lead to a well-paying career that would allow us to invest in our future.  With college tuition now leading in the nation's debt with the growing amount of 830 million dollars, we are stuck asking: Why is the college-loan system failing? The College Bubble was a term used to explain the effect of the nation's current financial crisis and college tuition constantly on the rise. That is creating the bubble of debt that will eventually burst. College tuition rates have skyrocketed up 29% in the last five years. The average school year for a standard four year, for-profit college now costs $27,293 and on average only two out of three students are graduating due to not being able to afford their college education. With the economy in a recession and losing over 8 million jobs between the years of 07-09, graduates are struggling in the job market, as well as paying off their student loans (Parker). During the beginning of the recession, many industries felt the collapsing of the economy, industries like that of the stock market, real estate and even oil! All industries but two: healthcare and colleges. During this difficult time, colleges are prospering at student's expense and graduates are not seeing the benefit. This makes the expenditure of college and the hard work of graduates, a poor investment. The government has tried to help students with government aid and programs for low-income graduates, but has failed to fix the problem. Colleges are charging too much for an education that even with government aid and loans cannot be affordable or paid off by a graduate in this struggling economy. The college loan system is failing students due to an endeavoring economy, over college spending causing higher tuition rates, depleting wages and declining job market. College tuition and the loan system that is in place to fund it must be modified to compensate in order to lower student debt. 
	College tuition has obviously risen to unmanageable amounts for college students, but why? It is due to the college arms race. Colleges are currently spending huge amounts of money on their campuses and recreational activities in order to encourage more students, which also means more money. Ohio University economics professor Richard Vedder was quoted saying, ""Every campus has [to have] it’s climbing wall, you cannot have a campus without a climbing wall""(McArdle). In 2009 alone, colleges spent a total of 10.7 billion dollars on construction of new facilities like gyms and nicer dorms in an afford to recruit more students. (Parker). Students will pay more money to attend a college that has a favorite college sports teams. When it comes to NCAA coaches, Brady states statistically that the average salary for a NCAA football coach was is $1.47 million in 2011, which in the last six seasons has climbed up nearly 55% (Brady). If teams meet performance goals, coaches will, in addition, receive bonuses. Such expenses made by colleges for sport teams, may be leisure for a student but how does this help them with a better quality education or with their crippling debt? Students are paying for something that in no way betters their education, just the notoriety of the college. Colleges have found many ways to capitalize off of their students in order to afford such expenditures. Some 4 year colleges require that you must be on campus for your first two years of attending with them. Room and board cost an average of $8,887 in the school year of 2011-12, that is up 4% since last year (College Board). It would make sense why they would require that you stay on campus, if it only put more money into their pockets. College books are another expense of students which colleges are benefitting from. Books are also required by colleges in order to attend classes and are not included in tuition. The cost of college books has tripled in the last 10 years, costing an average of $200 dollars (Parker). Colleges will publish their own books, require students to buy them, then update or revise them every year to make the book obsolete causing students to have to by new ones every year and making the resale of them, nonexistent! Colleges will work with publishers and receive kickbacks for using books they publish. Administration for college also feels the advantage of higher tuition rates. The president of Yale receives salary that has tripled from $591,709 in 2000, to $1.63 million in 2009 (McArdle). 
	Some experts argue that the rising cost of college tuition is due to federal aid programs. David Schnittger, aide to Education and Workforce Committee, argues that, ""The federal government should not have to automatically subsidize hyperinflation,” that ""there is no pressure on [colleges] to keep their rates down [due to government student tuition assistance programs]"" (Colin). What they don't take into consideration is that government aid is normally only given to low-income students. Middle and upper class students don't receive such aid. So how is it that government funded aid programs are to blame for the rising tuition costs? Now with the average cost of graduating at a 4 year college at $27,293 a year (Parker), it is easy to see who is truly profiting from an attending and/or graduated student. Colleges are capitalizing off students in a poor economy, and once out of college there is no guarantee employment will be waiting. 
	In 2008, Americans lost over 10.4 trillion dollars in the financial crisis. Between 2008-2010 over 8.3 millions of jobs were lost. The government tried bailing out the country with  4.6 trillion dollars and was only able to recover 1.1 million jobs, .9% percent of jobs. That is 4 million dollars in cost for each job recovered (Parker). Boyce Watkins, a finance professor at Syracuse University is quoted saying, ""[College] is certainly an investment. The question is whether or not you get your return on that investment in actual financial capital... [and] this blanket notion that going to college will guarantee you a better economic future is not always true""(Billitteri). In 2009, the numbers were at 12.5 million unemployed, which is 8.1 percent of the American population. The numbers have continuing to rise leaving the total count of unemployed at 17.5 million. With unemployment at the highest it’s ever been in the last 25 years (Katel), it's easy to see that even with the investment of college education, the job market is not in a state of stability leaving the college graduate to take minimal paying jobs, move trades, or move altogether to an area which is hiring. All of which is at a cost to them. 
Many people can't afford to move, so they need jobs to come to them. This is one of the least discussed, most challenging problems in the labor market right now...This is the largest annual jump in the number of unemployed since the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics began tabulating this data just after World War II. Most of the unemployed—62.3 percent—are out of work because they lost their job, higher than any point since 1982. (Boushey)
Some argue that college degrees do increase the likelihood of getting employment. The fields of healthcare, engineering and computer science have seen a sharp increase of employment within the last five years (Billitteri). However, are all students obligated to study in fields that are hiring so that they may make a high enough income to pay back student loans? If so, where will our educational teachers, earth science specialists and art specialists come from? Chances are these programs will lose funding. All these degree areas are feeling the economic downturn, does that mean that all students should have to pursue a degree that they don't wish to pursue, in order to guarantee enough income to pay back their student loans? Part of the American dream is to pursue what your passionate about, not to conform to the demands of society. Though some argue it is because of the student's degree choice, if all students were to graduate in a degree that was hiring, wouldn't that cause an abundancy of applicants? Making the job market for those jobs hiring like the rest, not hiring? College graduates not only face the outrageous cost of tuition but once finishing their degree they are stuck in a dead end job market which they cannot avoid. 
	With both college tuition and unemployment at record highs, it is not hard to see why the college loan system is failing. What once was the American dream has now turned into the national debt. With colleges spending too much on non-educational expenses and leaving their students to flip the bill in this economic downfall, it’s no wonder the college loan system is not helping the college graduate. The college loan system has to not only take into consideration the economy's state but the college's spending. While the nation is trying to recover and grow from the current recession it is important to recognize that student borrowing is working against our economic interests and the source of why that is happening. In order for the college graduate to pay off their debt, there must be employment after college and if that is not a guarantee, colleges must reevaluate their expenditures. Until the economy recovers from its current crisis, student debt will only worsen and end up not only costing the American graduate, but the nation as a whole.

I was originally a psych major, then switched to business, and have recently started considering a career in market research or something similar that would let me work with different research methods, statistics, human behavior, etc. These are all things I find myself pretty heavily interested in.

It has been suggested to me from several different people that I pursue a marketing degree while loading up on quantitative courses as electives, including statistics courses as well as survey methodology and design courses, etc. 

This sounds like an awesome plan, except my university seems to be sorely lacking in these types of classes. There are a couple of statistics classes offered that are only reachable after taking 3 calculus classes, which I am not at all excited about doing. I've always been pretty naturally good at math until I got up to trigonometry and calculus, at which point I started hating every minute of it and found myself very frustrated and uninterested. If I never had to take another calculus class again, it would be too soon. But as far as statistics, I am loving every minute of it so far.

But after some googling, I've found all these awesome courses at other universities under an ""applied statistics"" minor, with things like Introduction to Survey Sampling, Statistical Quality Methods, Design of Experiments, etc. These sound amazing, to say the least. I would love to take classes like these, and it sounds like they would be extremely helpful for the direction I want to head in career-wise. My university does not offer anything even remotely like this, and in fact I can't find any applied statistics minors/courses in the entire state.

I'm located in Nevada, which is pretty notorious for having a crappy educational system. But I'm here because between in-state tuition, a state grant, and the financial aid awarded to me, my tuition is completely covered. I'm also a Pell Grant recipient due to my parents' income. Without all of these monetary factors working together in my favor, I would not be able to afford college. So I figured I would just stay in state until completing undergrad because hey, it's being paid for, and then hope to attend graduate school somewhere else. But now I am wondering if it might be worth it to try to transfer somewhere else where I would have access to these classes I am talking about. I'm not really sure what kind of financial aid I would be eligible for as an out of state transfer student, though, and the whole process just seems like kind of a nightmare... but I'm starting to realize how disappointed I am in the lack of relevant course offerings, and am wondering what my options are.",college,Worth it to transfer?,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/10ywiv/worth_it_to_transfer/,1349417887.0

This semester, I still owe the school 1,500 dollars. I'm trying to get into a program that pays half my tuition and room and board, but that's not a guarantee, and I'm still looking for a job to help pay for everything, but it's not going so well.

I can't take much more of this stress, Reddit.

Can anyone give me advice? 

Or tell me similar situations you've been in and have overcome?

204,zayg,1344016217,/r/college/comments/xmou3/at_a_crossroads_here_what_the_hell_do_i_do/,"Hey everyone. So I'm pretty much stuck with what I have to do. Here is my story.

Went to high school. Through high school I wanted do be an architect or something along the lines of that. All four years I took architecture related courses and decided near the middle of my senior year that I really didn't want to do it. Sadly, this didn't leave me much to work with.

Went to a small, commuter only branch of a state school (UNH Manchester). It was a decent price, although New Hampshire state schools are ungodly expensive compared to most. I decided to just go for business. After a year I decided I wasn't crazy about it, but I was going to stick with it. While registering for classes for my sophomore year, I was not able to create a schedule that would work with all of my classes. Commuter school = 3 of my required classes ended up being at the same time on the same day late at night.

So I never went back there. Decided I wanted to do something else and was pushed to follow my dream. Applied for an art school in Boston for photography and got accepted and even granted some scholarships. Still, I would be paying $25k out of pocket every year and was not willing to take student loans on something that would probably end up paying $20k a year. So - dream crushed.

Decided I NEED to go back to school either way. Looked into a community college in my state (NHTI) that I actually liked the atmosphere of. While trying to decide my major, I learned about radiation therapy from my bosses wife. It sounded pretty decent - relatively in demand, the field is active where I want to live (Boston), the pay is excellent, and it sure as hell beats a cubicle job. It was too late for me to apply for the program, so I took the suggested route and went into the general studies program.

Well, yesterday I had orientation. The head of the general studies program broke the news to me that to get into the radiation therapy program you need to fulfill a bunch of requirements based on points from classes taken. She told me that only 1% of applicants made it (thanks for telling me in the first place NHTI!)...so I don't have a chance of getting in next year. So I'm essentially looking at going to community college for FOUR years for this - and that is at the least. There is always a chance I don't get in on my SECOND application and I have wasted two years and two years tuition on nothing.

So I pretty much have no clue on what to do here. I'm almost 21 and I pretty much have nothing in store for me. I honestly can't take four more years (if not more) of living at home in New Hampshire. I don't have the money to move out and go to school on my own, I don't have the training to get a good job to do that, and I can't afford to go away to school anywhere that won't drive me nuts since room and board is so expensive. Should I just go back for business and complete that?

I hope someone can give me an idea.",college,At a crossroads here - what the hell do I do?,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/xmou3/at_a_crossroads_here_what_the_hell_do_i_do/,1344034217.0

I'm a twenty-one year old, living at home with a low paying job at a department store. I've got two full semesters at my local community college (~29 credit hours) done, but I've reached a standstill.

I started off badly by being a jackass my senior year of high school and doing almost no work, so that screwed me a bit. Scored a 32 composite on the ACT, 1390 SAT, and perfect scores on all of my statewide comprehensives, save math. Test scores were never an issue for me, nor was the material; I was just a lazy prick. Hindsight is 20/20, blah blah.

Regardless of the shit-stained final quarter of my high school career,  went to community college. Not in any of my classes did I receive anything lower than A's, until I began to follow the same lazy, apathetic tendencies that plagued my senior-year-self. I failed three classes due to attendance, and just stopped going.

Keep in mind, this tuition came out of my own pocket, with help from my dad. I received no financial aid due to my awful transcripts.

Wasted money doing that, and blew the rest of my meager salary on pot and comic books. Now I'm stuck with even worse hours (dropped to MAYBE 20 a week), with my car insurance constantly looming and an unpaid traffic ticket haunting my every financial decision. My family has thus far move away, and I'm stuck in my home town living with friends until I can save enough money to somehow return to college, at least first to community and hopefully move in to a university soon after.

The problem here is, there are no jobs anywhere near where I live, and my student loans require a co-signer due to my lack of credit, which my parents refuse to sign (though I can't blame them, times are tough). 

I really do feel strongly motivated to better myself and return to school, and it's really aching to have a lack of any sort of studying or schoolwork in my life. I've grown up a bit too late, and now I have no idea where to go from here.

What should I do, reddit? Any advice from people who are/were in a similar situation? I'm at wits' end here, and getting pretty desperate - not because my quality of life is in danger of deteriorating any further, but because I truly want to go out and at least try to do something better with my life. I'm well aware that a degree isn't going to secure employment at a decently paying career, but I need to at least be able to say that I tried.

206,WanderingKing,1330021283,/r/college/comments/q2sxb/thoughts_on_dropping_out/,"Hey Reddit. I've been thinking of dropping out for a while. I can't afford to just go to college and they have revoked financial aid once, and with my parents selling their house last year, that will count to their overall income, meaning I'll be denied all but immediate interest loans.

While working (I'm in real estate management) and going to college at the same time is an option, I've found I'm much more interested in work than actually going to college. I can't seem to care about classes, however with the work I'm in I really enjoy it, and I want to stick with it.

Looking at my families history, they have all been very successful without degrees, and even my current VP didn't go to college. If I did eventually hit a limit to where I could go without a degree, then I could go to school then, either through community or university depending on what I needed. I wouldn't mind going for an associates at a CC anyway, just to ease the workload and the tuition cost.

I'm also considering moving to Canada, which I know having a degree would help, but I have a contact up there in the real estate business that could help me acquire a job.

Can  I get some input and possible advice?
