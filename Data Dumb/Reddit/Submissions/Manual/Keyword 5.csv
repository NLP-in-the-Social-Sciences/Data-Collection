But I'm unsure how much potential I have for improvement, what my ceiling is and that has been a big scary unknown since I started my studies at my university.

A bit of a backstory (There will be a TLDR if you want to skip this). 

I had a fairly chaotic childhood. Despite having two loving parents, they had serious demons which I'm somewhat sure were a reason for my public and high school experience. My grade two teacher actually told my mother that I would probably only ever be a C student (Insane to make that call), and I had no real direction or interests that motivated me to try in school. I never did homework, would get zeros on assignments and still passed because I tended to test well. In highschool I was pushed not to pursue university level courses (applied vs academic is what they were referred to here), the academic level courses I took I either failed or scraped by with a 50 due to my motivational problems. When retaking the same course I would usually finish the year with at least an 80-90 with a bit more effort on my part, clearly I wasn't just lacking intelligence...?

&amp;#x200B;

So after high school I worked full-time and fell into a bad crowd for me, an insecure guy without a male role model (a group of testosterone, alcohol fueled bros who wanted to be the biggest thing in my small town) I was beat up one night while drinking with them and after 10 months of solitude (they exiled me for pressing charges) I decided I had to leave my town (I was 22 with no life experience). I moved to Toronto to enroll in a college course I had little interest in, to escape, reinvent myself and because it was the only school that would accept me and my poor academic record. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did pretty well my first year despite some mental health issues, probably due to abandoning all of my comforts at once and moving from a town of 20 thousand to almost 3 million. I entered my second year still battling depression, social and general anxiety and by the time my 3rd semester of the program came to and end I was pretty sure I wouldn't follow through and work in the profession I was studying. At the start of my 4th semester, someone accused me of sexual assault to make their ex jealous (I know, wtf). I was arrested, kicked out of my residence and finished my school year couch hopping until I could rent a room with friends I made in my first year. Even though the charges were dropped, and my record was eventually cleared, my school expelled me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I began working retail, got a bit healthier in the head, and after 2 years I became miserable again, I was making money, had a great girlfriend and wide social circle but felt so empty. Video games, and other 21st century vices were just fillers for the parts of me I never explored as a child and adolescent. A friend of mine lent me Crime and Punishment and all of a sudden I was entranced, I had never been a reader apart from books with movie and video game adaptations (Lord of the Rings, Warcraft novels etc.) This type of reading felt different, I read 1984, then I discovered Christopher Hitchens from his ""Four Horsemen"" discussion with Sam Harris, Dan Dennett, and Richard Dawkins, so I read Hitchens books, then Jordan Peterson's... For the first time in my life I felt attached to a respectable ideal, a well read, well spoken person who could form their own opinions and defend them without fear.

&amp;#x200B;

I got into a very competitive school here through a mature student program and finished at, or near the top of my class, my professor even told me I have a natural knack for writing (wow something I'm good at, that doesn't embarrass me). I received an academic award/scholarship for the first time in my life as a 27 year old, the ceremony is in February. It's an incredible feeling, but I'm scared that I'm pretending to be something I'm not.

&amp;#x200B;

I look at my professors, my TAs, people like Hitchens, Peterson, and I think that these people were put on this path starting in grade school or earlier. They were nurtured, encouraged and pushed until their own individual greatness propelled them further. I'm a late bloomer from a broken home who is trying for something better, but I don't see my potential being anywhere near these people. IQ is a real thing, no matter how hard I work.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how extensive and sustainable mental plasticity can be, I've successfully reinvented myself but I don't know if I'll ever be as good as I want and that's kind of terrifying. I have days where I can read and write, and feel happy with it, and there are many days were I can't read an academic sentence with more than two commas and remember the meaning of that sentence. The jump from 1 to 3 classes has been very challenging and while I feel like I'm getting a grip on the learning curve, I just feel like something will give. My motivation and focus, my fears, my finances... et cetera. I know imposter syndrome is a real thing, and that we should never compare ourselves to others but it's something we all struggle with as humans, no?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently set on a philosophy major so I can learn how to think, read and write but it all seems a combination of dry, difficult and very demanding of time. I want to teach as a professor but the alternative plan is to do a double major in psychology as well, and be a clinician so I can help people, like I've been helped over the years. I just don't know if I have the smarts and work ethic to do it, the task seems to be above someone the likes of me and that I'm merely pretending to be smart in an effort to find some sort of passion, or distraction from life. Maybe they are the same thing...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, that was a lot to type, I'm sorry for sharing so much. It just kind of flowed out of me. Is there anyone out there who has walked a similar path, or has worked a student in a comparable situation? I feel like I'm the only one with my story, and while it's empowering to think of the obstacles I've overcome, it's also scary to think that I might be fairly alone in my fears...

Thank you all for taking the time to read this, and thank you in advance for any feedback you choose to provide. My ears are open. Now for that TLDR.

TLDR; I'm a 27 year old with a horrible academic history, now struggling to think I'm smart enough to reach my goals of philosophizing, teaching or being a clinical psychologist.",college,"27 - A Fresh Start - Afraid of My Potential, or Lack Thereof",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/e66su0/27_a_fresh_start_afraid_of_my_potential_or_lack/,1575515052.0
